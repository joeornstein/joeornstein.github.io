But since 2016, 5 out of 8<br />years have seen a Category IV storm make landfall<br />in the US!

Futures markets on the<br />Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Fedwatch) suggest<br />that investors are only uncertain about *how<br />much* rates will be cut, not whether they will be<br />cut.

In a majority of our games,<br />I felt that we were nearly guaranteed to win<br />at about 95% chance of winning. Our games with<br />Alabama and Texas dropped our chances considerably<br />as I felt we had a 40% and 50% chance of winning<br />respectively. Taking into account our record<br />against Alabama and Texas' new talent I felt these<br />were accurate, bringing the probability of going<br />undefeated to about 15%.","Brooke Mcdermott (80%): I reviewed the ESPN power<br />ranking chart that we talked about in class.<br />UGA was ranked 1st in their team strength, which<br />leads me to think they have a high probability<br />of doing extremely well in comparison to lower<br />ranked teams. However, their REM SOS is at a 3,<br />due to their schedule being relatively challenging<br />with teams like Bama and Texas on their docket.<br />However, with the loss of Saban this past season,<br />Alabama may falter, leaving Georgia more likely<br />to win. In contrast, a lot of sports analysts and<br />announcers have openly debated the Texas v. UGA<br />game and possibly the Alabama game as a potential<br />loss for UGA.","Abby Crowe (10%): I believe that the University<br />of Georgia football team has a 10% chance of<br />going undefeated in the 2024 regular season. I<br />am basing this prediction on the College Football<br />Headquarters (CFB) odds for each individual game.<br />At a glance, UGA is favored to win every game,<br />with Alabama and Texas being the least certainty,<br />but after multiplying the probabilities against<br />each other to determine the likelihood, it no<br />longer looked too good. I landed on 9.7% chance<br />of winning all regular season games, but because I<br />love the dawgs, I’m giving them a 10% chance.","Simon Gersten (30%): To calculate the<br />probability of UGA going undefeated, I assigned<br />win probabilities for each of their games and<br />multiplied them together. Respective to their<br />schedule, probabilities of 90%, 95%, 95%, 75%,<br />75%, 99%, 99%, 80%, 95%, 99%, 90%, 99% would give<br />them a 30% chance of going undefeated.","Minha Ahmad (75%): UGA has gone three straight<br />seasons without losing a single regular season<br />game so it is very likely that they will go<br />undefeated this year as well. However, there is<br />still a bit of room for doubt which is why I am<br />not 100% sure. This season, they will be playing<br />major teams like Alabama, Texas, and Ole Miss on<br />their home turfs and not at UGA.","Haley Ford (56%): Yes- I got a probability of 56%.<br />I did a combination of equivalent bet test and<br />probability trees. I did the odds I would feel<br />most comfortable with, then used a probability<br />tree to see that likelihood. Initially- I took<br />safer odds but the probability seemed to low, so<br />I had to be more deterministic about the games<br />we would win. Clemson: 100 % (1.00) Tennessee<br />Tech: 100% (1.00) Kentucky: 100%(1.0) Alabama:<br />70% (0.70) Auburn: 100% (1.0) Mississippi State:<br />100% (1.00) Texas: 70% (0.70) Florida: 100%<br />(1.00) Ole Miss: 100% (1.00) Tennessee: 80% (0.80)<br />Massachusetts: 100% (1.00) Georgia Tech: 100%<br />(1.00)","Liv Payne (43%): I do not know much about<br />football, so I turned to the internet to figure<br />out the likelihood of UGA being undefeated. Coach<br />Kirby Smart has been at UGA since 2016. Before<br />2023, the Bulldogs had not gone undefeated since<br />1980. According to an article by Si.com, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated under Smart for<br />3 seasons in a row. Therefore, my prediction is<br />based upon Smart's performance as a coach. Out<br />of the 7 seasons that Smart has been coach, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated 3 seasons. 3/7=0.428<br />or rounded up to 43%.","Jeffrey Markowitz (30%): Georgia faces the ninth<br />toughest schedule against some very strong teams<br />on the road, in difficult atmospheres to play in.<br />While the Dawgs look great going into the season,<br />college football is unpredictable. Injuries or<br />other issues could occur that are unpredictable at<br />this point.","Jessica Armour (65%): Based on the scores from<br />last years football schedule, UGA did the best<br />over all in comparison to the other teams. It was<br />also the only team (other than alabama) to win all<br />of their away games. Since away games are where<br />people struggle the most and UGA was undefeated in<br />them I would say it is pretty likely that Uga will<br />be undefeated this season. However considering<br />after being unsuccessful in maintaining undefeated<br />last year, and losing some players there is still<br />a chance they will not be, hence why I did not<br />give a perfect score for the probability.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (80%): UGA has been<br />undefeated in the past three regular seasons,<br />so I believe that winning a 4th season is not<br />an extreme idea. A CBS article by Will Backus<br />states that Georgia has the possibility of being<br />undefeated in its 2024 regular season. I consulted<br />my friend (who is an avid college football fan),<br />and he believes the possibility is there, but<br />Georgia will need to step up and prepare itself.<br />Some of the season games will be challenging, but<br />Georgia has the roster to do it.","Carson Ankeny (30%): While I do feel that the UGA<br />Football team has the roster and coaching staff<br />that could lead to an undefeated season, it is<br />still statistically unlikely that UGA could win<br />each of its most difficult matchups. Looking at<br />the schedule, there are several tough matchups,<br />including Texas and Alabama. Losing any one of<br />these or other difficult matchups would lead<br />to the forecast being broken, and I don't feel<br />confident that the Dawgs would win all of these<br />matchups, even if I expect their final record to<br />be 11-1.","Hayden Morehouse (55%): UGA is the best team<br />in college football this year. However, I have<br />been a fan for a long time, and it is tough to<br />have a perfect season. Most sports pages have<br />us projected to go undefeated, but I am a bit<br />sheepish. Things like injuries or just simply<br />a bad game can happen. We also have a tougher<br />schedule with playing Ole Miss, Texas, and Alabama<br />away.","Kira Liscombe (10%): I used the Sports Illustrated<br />predictions for each game on Georgia's 2024<br />football schedule. I converted the percentages<br />to decimals and multiplied them together. I came<br />up with a probability of 9.4, but based on other<br />articles predicting the Georgia football season, I<br />decided to predict a bit higher at 10.","Colin Barry (60%): The Bulldogs currently have<br />their projected win total set at +/-10.5, meaning<br />the consensus opinion is that they are likely to<br />lose a game. This comes from a tough schedule and<br />a newly expanded playoff system that leaves them<br />with much more room for error and makes them more<br />accepting of a single loss. This loss could come<br />from one of our powerhouse matchups at Alabama,<br />Texas, or Ole Miss, or could come from a trap<br />game no one sees coming (see Auburn last year,<br />or anytime we've played South Carolina at noon<br />for reference). That is why i think that the odds<br />Georgia goes undefeated are still slightly more<br />likely than not at around 60%, as even with all<br />these changes this season they are still the best<br />team in football.","Franco Bravo (25%): After talking to multiple<br />sources and friends who know a good amount of<br />college football, I believe that UGA will lose<br />at least 1 game in the season. The season is<br />unpredictable and with Big Name teams like Texas<br />and Alabama, I believe that UGA will fall to<br />at least one of those teams. Additionally, like<br />last season, UGA is also capable of getting into<br />unnecessary close games that have no reason being<br />that close and some can argue that those wins came<br />with some skill but also some sort of luck.","Corinne O'Dell (9.25%): Based on the win<br />probabilities for each individual game that UGA<br />will play, you can multiply those together to<br />get an overall probability. It is relatively low<br />because with us playing Alabama and Texas in a<br />regular season game, it is very unprecedented so<br />the games are currently predicted to be toss ups.l","Shayna Van Glish (8.9%): (Detailed in much more<br />length in the briefing I completed for this<br />question) I think that there is a 8.9% chance that<br />the Bulldogs go undefeated in the regular season<br />due to the fact that they have a tough away game<br />schedule, injuries that will occur, and a team<br />that has a lot of new players working to mesh well<br />with the returnees. While this number is fairly<br />low, my overall predictions for each game are<br />fairly high, yet not guaranteed wins for many.","Vikram Bharadwaj (37.5%): In the past 24 year,<br />only one team ranked number one in the preseason<br />polls has won 2 or more highly ranked (top 10)<br />away games, with the five others losing one or<br />both of these matchups. If we ignore this and look<br />at just 3 ranked away games, the record goes up<br />to 2/7, or about 28.6%. Now being a bit generous<br />here, we can round that up to 37.5, given that<br />UGA has done well in the past and is the betting<br />favorite in all three high ranked road games.","Abigail Harris (1%): I used the Sports<br />Illustrated power index ratings for the UGA<br />2024 regular season lineup. I multiplied the<br />chance the Bulldogs won each game by the chance<br />they would win the next game and so on and so<br />forth until I had factored in their chance of<br />winning all 12 games in a row. In the end I got<br />a .096409641377167/10 chance that the Dawgs go<br />undefeated. Out of 100 thats .96409641377167, so<br />I rounded up and estimated their probability of<br />going undefeated would be about 1/100.","Findleigh Ague (68%): I don’t know a ton about<br />football, but I tried my best to read up on what<br />the vibes are with UGA’s schedule this season.<br />There are definitely going to be some tough<br />games this season, but I think that perhaps not<br />making it to the national championships last<br />year after winning back to back could be a strong<br />motivator for the team and lead them to victory<br />in the regular season. I also looked at ESPN’s<br />Football Power Index, and not all of the data<br />points directly applied to going undefeated in the<br />regular season, but in general it looks as though<br />their simulations that they conducted had UGA<br />winning a lot.","Gracie Culpepper (37%): Alabama will be a tough<br />game for the Dawgs. We historically have very<br />close games with them, and on top of that their<br />game this season will be in Tuscaloosa. For<br />football teams, it is more difficult to win<br />the game if they are not in their home stadium.<br />Because of this, I think that it is more unlikely<br />that UGA will have an undefeated regular season<br />with this game added into their schedule.","Alexis Frazer (65%): I started with the baseline<br />probability of going undefeated, then factored<br />into account each team's probability of beating<br />UGA. Taking into account Georgia's records in<br />the 3 most recent years, the probability of going<br />undefeated would be greater than any other SEC<br />team. The Alabama game could go unfavorably (based<br />off the SEC champ game last season), however,<br />because they lost their head coach and multiple<br />starters, Bama's likelihood of beating UGA is<br />lower this year than last. UT is not going to be<br />a problem given it is their first year in the SEC,<br />so on, so forth, until I came to 65%.","Erin Ho (5%): The reason I chose this estimate<br />is because I looked up UGA’s upcoming football<br />games and made my own estimate based on what I<br />knew about UGA and what I knew about the teams we<br />were playing. I multiplied all the values I made,<br />because this is what I think are our chances of<br />winning consecutively, no possibilities of losing<br />at all. I initially thought of 78%, because that’s<br />the median for all the percentages, but this<br />seemed more correct to me.","Reece Slater (22%): I first examined all preseason<br />#1 ranked college football teams since 1990 and<br />looked at the frequency of an undefeated regular<br />season. First I did SEC only teams, which was<br />33.3%, then I looked at all teams which was 40.9%.<br />I then used the tree branch (visualization) method<br />and multiplied all of the probabilities that UGA<br />would win each game according to ESPN Analytics.<br />This gave me a probability of 8.7% that UGA goes<br />undefeated. I then used the equivalent bet test<br />to find where my gut feels in the middle of this<br />data. This brought me to my conclusion of 22%<br />probability.","Leo Zegarra (60%): Although it may seem very<br />unlikely given the schedule this year, I believe<br />that the dawgs will go undefeated mainly due to<br />their depth. Because injuries occur so often in<br />football and teams are usually held back from<br />their potential as result, UGA simply shines<br />in the aspect of roster depth. Obviously, Kirby<br />Smart and his coaching staff is also exceptional,<br />meaning that this season will be backed up by<br />great minds and a great Carson Beck. Plus, 15<br />dawgs were named to the all SEC team, including<br />numerous offensive linemen, which are key to<br />allowing a great QB work his magic. Plus, UGA<br />has great defensive players who were named, which<br />prevents easy scoring. All in all, the teams they<br />are facing aren't as strong, especially when you<br />look at Alabama, who lost their head coach and<br />three outstanding players to the transfer portal.","Matthew Harvey (75%): My reasoning behind<br />assigning this number involves several factors<br />including my confidence level, regular season<br />games, starting rosters of the UGA, as well as<br />starting players for other teams. UGA is rated,<br />according to the Football Power Index, to be the<br />favorites to win the SEC as well as being the<br />favorites to make it to the National Championship<br />game as well. This index should let alone give<br />UGA a 50% chance of success in the regular season.<br />However, the issue is that other teams that are in<br />the top 5 likely teams to have a chance of winning<br />the national championship are among the teams UGA<br />has to play in the regular season. They are both<br />away games which also are historically shown to be<br />more difficult for away teams to win if the games<br />are determined to be contested. Therefore I am<br />confident this puts UGA directly between 100% and<br />50%.","Rommy Etzion (0%): The real question is what<br />are the odds Georgia is going to lose 1 game.<br />According the predictions made by \"Dawn of the<br />Dog,\", there are 3 games they are expected to<br />lose. So the question is if there's a probability<br />they win instead of lose. According to the<br />websites predictions, there is an expected game<br />where the dogs lose 52-17 and another 38-12. If<br />calculating the probability that UGA turns it<br />around, it would be very low. Going undefeated is<br />incredibly hard and statistically, based on expert<br />predictions, unlikely. A single loss means they<br />would not have an undefeated record, and there<br />are 3 predictions of a loss. Sorry to sound like a<br />pessimist, I also don't know much about football.","Alex Vrolijk (60%): I chose 60% because while I<br />believe UGA is one of the if not the best team<br />going into the upcoming season, we have some<br />difficult away games. The away games I am most<br />worried about are the Alabama and Texas games<br />because Alabama has had a lot of roster changes<br />and Texas is predicted to be a very strong team.","David Daniels (10%): To put my conclusion shortly,<br />no. After referring to resources made available<br />to the public (these including professional<br />sports analyzers, and betting odds) it becomes<br />apparent that the probability of some games<br />(let alone the whole) is less than a coin flip.<br />Considering that there are 12 games in the<br />regular season, someone without any college<br />football would deduce that the probability is<br />simply 0.5^12 equaling roughly 0.024%. However,<br />some of these games are not a coinflip. A decent<br />portion of the games in our conference have UGA<br />favored significantly. Sport analysts essentially<br />dismiss all games with exception to a few, Ol<br />Miss Texas, and Alabama. In these games we are<br />also the favored team. Projected Outcomes 2024<br />Schedule: 1. Clemson Georgia's odds: 82.3%<br />2. Tennessee Tech Georgia's odds: 99.0% 3. at<br />Kentucky Georgia's odds: 88.0% 4. at Alabama<br />Georgia's odds: 59.1% 5. Auburn Georgia's odds:<br />88.4% 6.

Tennessee Georgia's odds: 79.4%<br />11. UMass Georgia's odds: 99.0% Figures for<br />GA Tech game 12 not available. This is what It<br />would look like to crunch these numbers: Total<br />Probability=0.823×0.990×0.880×0.591×0.884×0.939×0.524×0.853×0.788×0.794×0.990<br />Totaling in a rough probability of 9.716%, or a<br />10 on a scale from 1-100. Give these numbers it<br />is not likely that UGA will go undefeated in the<br />regular season despite being the favorites.","John Mathis (45%): I used the equivalent bet<br />test to get a read on my gut feeling, and I would<br />rather get 1000 dollars if they go undefeated<br />than guessing on a slightly weighted coin flip.<br />Furthermore, I looked at individual game win<br />chances and weighted my answer based on that."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.52000000000000002,0.34999999999999998,0.75,0.69999999999999996,0.81999999999999995,0.20000000000000001,0.19,0.14999999999999999,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.66000000000000003,0.25,0.10000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.13,0.72999999999999998,0.23000000000000001,0.84999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.17999999999999999,0.69999999999999996,0.73999999999999999,0.65000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.050000000000000003,0.20000000000000001,0.65000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.60999999999999999,0.75,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.84499999999999997,0.90000000000000002,0.75,0.80000000000000004,0.80000000000000004,0.75,0.94999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.65000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.98999999999999999,0.94999999999999996,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.88,0.80000000000000004,0.79000000000000004,0.10000000000000001,0.80000000000000004],"y":[1.0215395851293578,0.9649405817734078,0.99056707471609118,0.9822141730925068,1.0028605693718418,1.0234372174367308,0.95523287905380128,0.99955914150923486,0.95653402518946673,1.0104718218557536,0.96715816571377222,0.96666134139522908,1.040067459619604,1.0368123929714783,0.98764456787612287,0.98331160130910578,1.0432645159075036,0.95370827952865511,0.99496312355622651,1.0311515732202678,0.99500044365413487,1.0473755483515561,1.0253738249186426,0.98258163975551727,1.0370607452932745,0.96915952253621074,1.011190969008021,1.0495639285305516,1.045195498270914,1.0071014814078807,0.95723270222079004,2.0344263180391864,2.0477526048896832,1.9835080193821342,2.0474050989141688,2.0140757957007738,1.9960495237493887,1.9775597896194086,2.0039676999207585,2.0215083244955165,1.9662977556930854,2.0439798366511241,2.030837946967222,2.0464410132495687,2.0206724235089495,1.9511435996042565,2.0418053456582128,2.0313643595902251,1.9782396758440881,2.0118569827638568,1.9626680283341558,2.0131255713757126,1.970758218318224,1.963606166257523,1.9519531476078555,2.0317977593280374,1.953149769664742,2.0147800092818215,2.0183032731292769,1.9545462192036211],"text":["Corinne O'Dell (52%): Based on the past fifty<br />years, there have been 9 hurricanes in the US that<br />have been a category 4 or above. Using this and<br />factoring the NOAA's predicitions for major storms<br />this upcoming season, there is a toss up chance<br />for a category 4 or above hurricane to hit.","Ryan Foley (35%): Only 23% of hurricanes in the<br />2010s that hit the mainland were category 4 or<br />above. Currently, in the 2020s we are at 25% for<br />category 4 landfalls. Combining this with the fact<br />that we are projected to have a more active than<br />average hurricane season, I concluded that 35%<br />would be feasible as it is still unlikely but not<br />quite as much as 25%.","Erin Ho (75%): I chose this estimate was because I<br />had looked at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br />Administration’s hurricane reports. Based on<br />the records from the NOAA, in years where they<br />predicted an above-normal season, there was a<br />Category IV or above hurricane. Examples are<br />Hurricane Laura in 2020 (Category IV), Hurricane<br />Ida in 2021 (Category IV), and Hurricane Ian<br />(Category IV). In May of this year, the NOAA<br />predicted we would have an above-normal season<br />for 2024. As of the end of August, we have already<br />had one tropical storm, and two hurricanes make<br />landfall in the US.","Abby Crowe (70%): I predict that there is a 70%<br />chance of a category IV or above hurricane hitting<br />the mainland United States before December 1st.<br />This prediction is based on predictions from<br />the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association<br />(NOAA) for this storm season, as well as a cross<br />comparison to previous years, their weather<br />patterns, and former NOAA predictions. (This is<br />the introduction to my brief)","Alexis Frazer (82%): Rising temperatures and<br />the consistency over the past 3 years of 1 or<br />more stage IV hurricanes striking mainland US<br />makes it very probable for a stage IV hurricane<br />to hit this year. They typically occur from<br />august-october, and are even more likely if<br />temperatures are abnormally high. The national<br />oceanic and atmospheric assosciation predicted its<br />likelihood to be 85% or higher. I calculated the<br />probability based off of data from recent years<br />and meteorologists general consensus on the issue.","Carson Ankeny (20%): Looking only at hurricanes<br />since the year 2000, it is fairly rare that a<br />category 4 storm makes landfall on the mainland<br />as a category 4. By my count, there were only<br />6 storms that made contact as a category 4 or<br />above according to the National Hurricane Center<br />and NOAA. That means that 6/24 years since 2000,<br />there was a category 4 to hit the mainland, which<br />would be a 25% chance. However, since hurricane<br />season starts in June, and we are already in<br />August (and nearly September), I think that the<br />window is closing a bit. For that reason, I marked<br />the probably slightly lower than that data would<br />suggest, at 20%.","Brooke Mcdermott (19%): La Niña is predicted to be<br />much more intense this coming season. Water in the<br />Atlantic is reportedly at record warmth, and in<br />addition to this, the West African Monsoon winds<br />are reportedly extremely high this season. These<br />in combination with other environmental factors<br />influencing climate change and the atmosphere,<br />there is a much higher chance that the East Cost<br />and Gulf Shore of the US may experience more<br />intense hurricane such as a Cat 4 or 5. This being<br />said, I'm unsure if the hurricane will actually<br />hit land at a Cat 4 or 5. We have seen a Cat<br />5 hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, hit the US Gulf<br />Coast this year. And with increasing intensity in<br />weather trends, it wouldn't be out of left field<br />for another large hurricane to hit the mainland.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): I think regardless of<br />any research you do this question is a tossup.<br />However, I put my probability at 15% for these<br />reasons. Since August of 2020 three category four<br />hurricanes have hit the US mainland. The last<br />one being in September of 2022. This means the<br />probability should be higher right? The reason I<br />put it so low is because my research shows that<br />August and September are the busiest months for<br />hurricanes. Three of the last four of these things<br />have hit in August, which is essentially over.<br />Giving us one more month to have a real shot at a<br />hurricane as big as category 4.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): The National Oceanic<br />and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an<br />above-normal hurricane season due to factors like<br />record-warm sea surface temperatures. 14-21 storms<br />are to occur, with 2-5 major hurricanes coming<br />from these (Cat 3 or higher). Given this forecast,<br />I think the probability of one of these hitting<br />the US mainland as a Cat 4 or higher is 25.","Minha Ahmad (60%): This year there have been<br />record breaking warm ocean temperatures, and the<br />NOAA has forecasted that there will be 4-7 major<br />hurricanes with a 3, 4, or 5 category rating<br />in the Atlantic in 2024. The last Category 4<br />hurricane was Hurricane Ida in 2021, however,<br />because 4-7 major hurricanes are predicted to hit<br />the US this year, I think that there is a high<br />chance a category 4 hurricane will be among them.","William Willis (66%): I believe that there is<br />a 66 probability that there will be a category<br />4 hurricane hit by December 1 of this year. The<br />reason behind by confidence is that the latest one<br />of these hurricanes has ever hit was November. I<br />did a little bit of research on the likely hood<br />of it happening and each weather website said<br />that warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea<br />could result in a hurricane. Also other factors<br />such as reduced vertical wind shear and weaker<br />tropical Atlantic trade winds.","Simon Gersten (25%): The current NOAA forecast<br />predicts an 85% chance of an above-normal<br />hurricane season, with 4-7 major hurricanes<br />expected this year. Given that the season is<br />likely to favor strong hurricanes, there is<br />significant likelihood of a Cat 4 or cat 5<br />hurricane occurring. Historically, the U.S.<br />mainland is hit by a Cat 4 or above hurricane<br />every 2-3 years, and given the other conditions,<br />the likelihood is higher than an average year, but<br />still not extremely likely.","Vikram Bharadwaj (10%): While in the past 24<br />years there have been six total hurricanes to have<br />hit mainland US at a category 4 or higher level,<br />four of them were either at the very beginning<br />of September or middle of August. Seeing as how<br />the NOAA gives a 20% chance of a storm forming in<br />the next two weeks, I chose to exclude those four<br />hurricanes, giving us a 2/24 = ~8% rounding that<br />up to 10 percent.","Kira Liscombe (60%): Firstly, I confirmed that the<br />Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from Sat, Jun 1,<br />2024 – Sat, Nov 30, 2024, which means we are in<br />the peak of the season. I learned that Hurricane<br />Idalia was the only U.S. landfalling hurricane<br />in 2023, and it made landfall as a category-3<br />hurricane. This gave me some doubts about how<br />likely we were to receive a category 4 this year.<br />However, I also found that NOAA’s outlook for the<br />2024 Atlantic hurricane season predicts an 85%<br />chance of an above-normal season. Considering all<br />of this i ended up with a probability of 60, since<br />there is high likeleiedhood of an active season<br />this year but low historical frequency of Cat. 4<br />landfalls.","Gracie Culpepper (40%): I'm putting my answer<br />higher for a few reasons. The first is that<br />we have 2 months left of hurricane season and<br />have already had 2 Cat-4 hurricanes since 2021<br />alone. The second is that we are in the midst<br />of a La Nina year, which makes it more likely<br />to experience turbulent weather in the Atlantic<br />Ocean. My third reason is that the NOAA's<br />prediction for this year is that hurricane season<br />may be one of the busiest on record. For these<br />reasons, I'm putting it at 40% likely to happen.","Haley Ford (13%): NOAA reports: 79% of La<br />Niña, 90% above normal season and 70% chance<br />in August/October. 8/13 storms are forecasted<br />to be hurricanes, 4-7 major hurricanes with a<br />confidence of 70%. So, I did 79%+70% /2. Then *<br />70% confidence * .25 for my guess of what chance a<br />hurricane would be 4 if it was any category.","David Daniels (73%): After extensive research<br />from weather forecast professionals, historical<br />data, and the equivalency test, I have concluded<br />a favorable probability of a Category 4 or greater<br />hurricane making landfall prior to December 1st<br />in the USA. Weather experts estimate a rough<br />probability of .70 that these circumstances prove<br />true. Likewise, in the last 7 years alone, 6<br />hurricanes have met this criteria. lastly weather<br />patterns such as La Niña and El Niño positively<br />impact the probability of a hurricane to our<br />requirements. All of these factors considered, I<br />give a probability of .73 in favor.","Edward Tsui (23%): According to the National<br />Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane<br />Center, only two category IV and one category<br />V hurricane hit the U.S between 2011 and 2020.<br />With only being in this modern decade three to<br />4 years, there have already been two category IV<br />hurricanes. The 3 out of 19 total hurricanes in<br />the first decade leads to a 0.158 probability in<br />the decade. However, The official NOAA predicts an<br />above-normal Atlantic hurricane season with rising<br />temperatures. Thus I about 1.5X the previous<br />probability to account for weather patterns<br />increasing in temperature this season. The most<br />frequent months for hurricanes happen by September<br />but the season lasts until about November.","John Mathis (85%): 6 out of the past 7 years have<br />had at least one Cat 4 or above, with some years<br />having multople, which would be a base rate of<br />around 85%. Furthermore, we seem to be in a La<br />Nina year, which makes conditions for hurricanes<br />more favorable. NOAA lists the following factors<br />that would also increase the likelihood of a CAT<br />4: Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean<br />Sea. Reduced vertical wind shear. Weaker tropical<br />Atlantic trade winds. An enhanced west African<br />monsoon. Even Last year, during a very strong<br />el Nino year we had a cat 4, and due to rising<br />global average temperatures, I see no reason for<br />this to all of a sudden make a switch on a year<br />with more favorable conditions. You have to go<br />back to 2016 to find a La Nina year where aCat 4<br />did not hit the mainland US, and I theorize that<br />this was due to Hurricane Matthews path that year,<br />which went over Haiti, Grand bahamas, AND cuba<br />before reaching south carolina, giving ample time<br />and land for the storm to dissipate. This was<br />also during a weak la Nina year without the other<br />favorable conditions.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (20%): I think that<br />before hurricane season ends, we will see a<br />category 4 hurricane. However, I don't think it<br />will hit mainland US as a category 4. I looked<br />at the previous hurricanes seasons this season<br />has been compared to (1878, 1926, 1998, 2010,<br />and 2020) and only 2 were category 4 when they<br />hit mainland US. The season has been quite so far<br />because of the Atlantic Nina.","Rommy Etzion (18%): In June, the beginning of the<br />season, forecasters reported in high confidence<br />that it’s predicted to be a busy above-average<br />season (85%), with about 4-7 major hurricanes.<br />There are near-record warm temperatures, less wind<br />shear in the Atlantic which allows hurricanes to<br />intensify, and an abundant oceanic heat content<br />in the tropical Atlantic which creates more energy<br />to fuel developments. That being said, its been<br />eerily quiet in the Atlantic this month, which<br />was unexpected to forecasters, and has strayed<br />from their original forecast. This is significant<br />because August is the 2nd most active month,<br />following September. This shows that so far,<br />the forecasters overestimated the season. This<br />development significantly lowers my prediction.","Abigail Harris (70%): First I looked up some<br />of the national statistics on how likely<br />administrations thought it would be that the<br />mainland US would be hit by a major hurricane.<br />The average of those predictions came around to<br />about 60% (inflated by including CAT 3s). Every<br />three years approximately 2 major (CAT 3 or above)<br />hurricanes hit the mainland US, or it's about<br />66.67% likely. In the last 4 years, 3 major storms<br />(CAT 4 or above for my purposes) have hit the<br />mainland US at about a 75% likeliness. However,<br />I wanted to balance longterm data trends and<br />shortterm conditions by choosing a middle ground<br />that accounts for an expert prediction (unreliable<br />this far out) of about 60%. Thus, I went sightly<br />for the lower side by picking 70/100, 5 pts down<br />from the higher trend, 3-4pts from the lower.","Matthew Harvey (74%): According to Wikipedia<br />which has decent data regarding this particular<br />question, the 3 most prominent months where a<br />category 4 hurricane manifests are in August,<br />September, and October. The rough estimate of the<br />amount that have been quantified within these 3<br />months are roughly 140. The amount of category<br />4’s that have hit the mainland are around 84<br />roughly. Therefore, if you were to use the total<br />amount of category 4’s to hit landfall and put<br />that over the total amount of cat 4’s between July<br />and November being 147 you get a probability of<br />around 57%. However this takes data from in the<br />1850’s and before the Saffir-Simpson scale was<br />invented which took place in 1971. The new number<br />of landfall hurricanes is now 39 as opposed to the<br />84 previously. The amount of category 4 hurricanes<br />since 1971 has been 61. Therefore the new<br />statistic I am going with is around 63% likely.<br />The NOAA predicts that 2024 will have an above<br />normal hurricane season for 24 with putting there<br />odds around 85% likely to have an abnormal season.<br />I am going to take the mean of there score and<br />mine and put it at about a 74% likely chance we<br />will see a category 4 hurricane hit the mainland.<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Category_4_Atlantic_hurricanes<br />https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season","Colin Barry (65%): I would say that it is more<br />likely than not that a category 4 or greater<br />hurricane will make landfall in the U.S. this<br />hurricane season. The Atlantic Ocean Basin is<br />projected to be incredibly active this hurricane<br />season due to factors like increased sea surface<br />temperatures, weaker Atlantic trade winds, and<br />and enhanced west African monsoon. The season has<br />already seen the fastest formation of a category 5<br />ever with Hurricane Beryl, even if it didn't make<br />landfall. These factors point to a very active<br />hurricane season which i think has a 65% chance of<br />a category 4 or greater storm making landfall.","Reece Slater (60%): Looked at NOAA data. Looked at<br />historical hurricane data. Very high air and water<br />temperatures and El Nino/La Nina activity.","Leo Zegarra (70%): Based off of recent years,<br />there's a higher average of Category 4 hurricanes<br />hitting the mainland. The last time one hit was<br />in 2022 and they are said to hit the mainland once<br />every 3 years. Plus, there is a really high chance<br />of La Niña happening in September, which is said<br />to increase the likelihood of major hurricanes,<br />which include Category 4 hurricanes. Plus, the<br />climate in recent years has been historically<br />higher compared to years prior, which boosts the<br />probability. Plus, there is a higher probability<br />of hurricanes occurring is in the next couple<br />of months, which fits in the timeline of before<br />December 1st. Also, what is scarier than a<br />hurricane hitting the mainland is a hurricane not<br />hitting the mainland for a while. So, I am fairly<br />confident that a category 4 will hit the mainland<br />before December 1st.","Jeffrey Markowitz (75%): Hurricanes and other<br />tropical storms are becoming very common.","Liv Payne (85%): NOOA says that \", a typical<br />season will yield 14 named storms, of which<br />seven become hurricanes and three become major<br />hurricanes.\" However, this season seems to be more<br />extreme due to higher temperatures and heavier<br />rain, so they predict at 90% that this season<br />will yield above-normal results. Also, category<br />4 hurricanes hitting land seem to be increasing,<br />with 2 (Franklin and Idalia) hitting land in<br />2023. Therefore, I think it is highly likely that<br />another cat 4 hurricane will hit.","Alex Vrolijk (5%): This is because on average only<br />2 hurricanes hit mainland US per year, and we are<br />already halfway through the hurricane season. It<br />is also rare for a cat 4 or above Hurricane to<br />hit the mainland. However, there have been cat<br />4+ hurricanes that have hit US mainland in recent<br />years including in 2017, 2018, and 2022. Although<br />it is not impossible for a cat 4+ hurricane to hit<br />the mainland before Dec. 1st (with September being<br />the most active month), it is highly unlikely.","Jessica Armour (20%): Based on past years, there<br />has only been a handful of Cat. 5 hurricanes to<br />hit U.S. soil, therefore it is very unlikely that<br />one will hit by Dec 2. With that being said, it<br />would be more likely that a hurricane within a<br />lower category would hit U.S. soil because they<br />are more common in occurrence than those of Cat. 5","Franco Bravo (65%): After doing several research<br />the last couple days and also talking a family<br />member who is involved in weather and climate in<br />Jamaica, he told me that it is pretty probable<br />for their to be a cat 4 storm. Also in the last 10<br />years it has happend more than half the time, so<br />hence the reason why I chose 65.","Jeffrey Markowitz (95%): Every single indicator is<br />pointing towards the Fed lowering interest rates.<br />The Federal Reserve has held multiple meetings to<br />discuss it, and it is very public that they will<br />lower interest rates for the first time since<br />2020.","Ryan Foley (95%): Recently Jerome Powell implied<br />that a cut is rates is coming during a speech<br />at Jackson Hole. He stated, \"The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.\" This appears to be him<br />telling Americans that cuts are coming and chances<br />are they will be during this upcoming September<br />meeting.","Jessica Armour (61%): Based on my math of how<br />economy stimulation has decreased from 2023-2024<br />and knowing that the economy needs stimulation<br />in order to thrive, and also based on the trends<br />of inflation rates it is not likely that the<br />inflation rates will continue to rise and will<br />rather decrease even if by a minute amount in<br />order to ensure stimulation of the economy.","Abby Crowe (75%): I give it a 75% chance that<br />the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates at its<br />September meeting. I base this prediction almost<br />entirely on language presented by Jerome Powell,<br />the Chair of the Fed. Specifically this quote:<br />“The time has come for policy to adjust. The<br />direction of travel is clear, and the timing and<br />pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data,<br />the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,”<br />which he said in late August. He has hinted in the<br />past year at several cuts, and with the last two<br />meetings of the year approaching quickly, I think<br />there is a high likelihood of interest rate cuts<br />at the next meeting. Because I am in no place to<br />speak on markets and the fluctuation of interest<br />rates, I am leaning into expert opinions and<br />direct quotes to guide my forecast.","Hayden Morehouse (95%): I put 95% for this<br />question for mainly one reason, Federal Reserve<br />Chair Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole about<br />a week ago and he strongly hinted that the Fed<br />plans to cut rates. He said “The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel<br />is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts<br />will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks,”. To me<br />this means that a rate cut is coming, they just<br />have not declared how much rates will be cut<br />by. This has been something that has been long<br />overdue in some peoples eyes and I am nearly<br />certain the announcment will come in September.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Haley Ford (95%): I am giving this such a high<br />probability because the word's out of Jerome<br />Powell's mouth himself, and the slew of articles<br />from WSJ, NYT etc. that verify that a rate cut<br />is expected, it is the amount that is a point of<br />speculation at the moment.","Colin Barry (75%): In recent weeks, speculation<br />over whether the FED will cut interest rates has<br />largely shifted from whether or not they will cut<br />them to, how much will they lower them by. This<br />follows Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair,<br />'s recent hint that changes will be coming soon<br />and that the direct of these changes has become<br />clear. This indicates that questions of when the<br />FED will cut rates will be answered, the only<br />question that remains is how soon. Many fixed<br />markets are fully preparing for the FED to cut<br />rates at its September meeting, as experts have<br />predicted following this hint. I expect that this<br />preparation indicates that there is around a 75%<br />chance that rates will be cut on September 18th.","Brooke Mcdermott (85%): It seems extremely likely<br />that the Fed will cut rates this September. The<br />Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has<br />said publicly that that's what the Fed intend to<br />do coming closer to the meeting. Inflation has<br />fallen significantly from our peak two years ago,<br />and is not far off from the Fed's target at 2.5%.<br />I think the next question is how much will the Fed<br />cut down, which seems to be the common denominator<br />amongst news outlets. Some Wall Street traders<br />are estimating that there is a 1/3 chance that<br />the Fed will cut by at least a half point, others<br />are saying a proposal of .25 over the span of the<br />next three meetings. I felt it may be best to stay<br />conservative in my prediction due to the fact that<br />the August unemployment rate will play a role in<br />how much the Fed cuts rates, in addition to other<br />factors. I think this pay pose a small risk to the<br />rates decreasing. Additionally, there is some risk<br />politically in that it would benefit the Harris<br />campaign greatly for us to see continued growth,<br />and the Trump campaign is extremely resistant to<br />rate cuts so close to the election.","Franco Bravo (75%): After having discussed with<br />several of my friends who are business, finance<br />and overall more in tune with this subject, they<br />are very confident that the Fed will lower rates.<br />One of my friends told me that they discussed this<br />in one of his classes and his professor told them<br />that he was almost positive that this infact will<br />happen.","Alexis Frazer (85%): The chairman of the feds<br />asserted a very strong message in his last remarks<br />that the interest rates will be taken down this<br />quarter. The primary debate surrounding interest<br />rates is less whether or not the reserve will<br />decrease interest rates, but rather by how much<br />they will decrease interest rates. Will it be a<br />quarter or half point reduction? I will be happy<br />with either, and am hoping this politician is<br />being truthful because it has been a decent amount<br />of time since interest rates were lowered and they<br />nearly promised an upcoming change.","Edward Tsui (84.5%): I am hedging my probability.<br />I based my number on multiple sources. According<br />to CNBC and Fox Business, the term trader used<br />indicates traders think there is a 100% chance<br />of a FED rate cut. Other sources indicate a 93.3%<br />probability, and the 30 day FED Future Rate with<br />the CME group (at 4:50pm) show a reduction in<br />expected price of the future of 0.02% in the<br />future price, which is about a 25 to a 80 base<br />point reduction in the overall interest rate.<br />According to the FED Watch as well, there is a<br />67.5% expectation of a target rate in September to<br />be between 500-525 base points (5-5.25% interest<br />rate) and a 37.5% expectation for 475-500 base<br />points. (4.75-5% interest rate) Both expectations<br />are lower than the current rate this week of 5.5%","Carson Ankeny (90%): I strongly believe that<br />the Fed will cut interest rates at the September<br />meeting. This is due to a variety of factors,<br />most importantly statements from the Fed Chairman<br />himself, as well as the pressing economic factors<br />that would cause the Fed to make that decision.<br />While there is a small chance that rates are<br />not lowered, most likely due to a conservative<br />and “safe” fiscal mindset that the Fed has<br />historically possessed under Chairman Powell, I<br />believe that the pressures on the Fed to act are<br />too great, and that there will be at least a small<br />decrease at the meeting on September 18th, leading<br />to incremental cuts at their remaining meetings<br />for the rest of the year.","Gracie Culpepper (75%): I'm putting mine very high<br />because based off of what the chairman said, I<br />really believe that they will lower the interest<br />rates. His last remarks seemed to hint that he was<br />interested in voting for them to go down, and most<br />websites I looked at were debating how much it<br />would drop by, not if it would drop at all.","Victor Avila (80%): I believe the FED will decide<br />to lower its rates at its September meeting with<br />an 80% probability. I came to these findings<br />through researching the history of the Federal<br />Interest Rates and how long they typically peak<br />and fall. Rates most recently peaked in August<br />2023 at 5.33. I then found a point in time with<br />similar rates and similar inflation (2.9). This<br />year was 2006. ⅘ similar scenarios have rates<br />peaking for about a year before the FED drops<br />rates. August 2024 makes a year that rates have<br />been steady at 5.33 as I anticipate them lowering<br />in September.","Corinne O'Dell (80%): Federal Reserve Chair Jerome<br />Powell strongly hinted that a cut is coming, and<br />many other financial analysists think the same.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): Given the current economic<br />conditions and the signals from the Federal<br />Reserve, I'd estimate the probability of the Fed<br />deciding to lower interest rates at its September<br />2024 meeting to be around 75%. This reflects a<br />strong likelihood, but not a certainty, as the Fed<br />remains cautious and data-dependent.","David Daniels (95%): This question has been nearly<br />answered prior to the date of the meeting. Federal<br />Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the<br />fed will likely make changes that lower interest<br />rates as indicated by his words, \"The time has<br />come for policy to adjust. The direction of<br />travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate<br />cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks.” Even without<br />this bombshell of information I would still be<br />in the 80-90 probability because of historical<br />baselines established with trends of inflation and<br />fed meetings.","John Mathis (90%): Well, unemployment has rose<br />to 4.3% when it was at a low of 1% last year,<br />according to McGregor McCance of University of<br />Virginia. Furthermore, according to the same<br />source, the Fed is satisfied with the 2% interest<br />rates it has recently achieved. So, because<br />interest rates are cooling and unemployment is<br />on the rise, it only makes sense for the Fed to<br />cut interest rates. All of this has led head of<br />the Fed Jerome Powell to say “the time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.” This, to me, hints<br />that the Chair of the Fed aims to cut interest<br />rates no matter what, but the size of those cuts<br />will depend on a lot of economic factors. While<br />Powell does not single-handedly decide the rate<br />adjustments, he is the head of the Federal Open<br />Market Committee, so I doubt he would say this<br />without certainty that the rest of the board will<br />back him up. Furthermore, more members of the<br />committee were seemingly open to cutting rates<br />back in July, and since pressure has only mounted<br />since then, I expect more and more members to be<br />on board with cutting rates. Given the historical<br />record of the Fed cutting interest rates with<br />rising unemployment and falling inflation rates<br />(historical record), as well as hearing it<br />straight from the mouth of the Fed Chair himself<br />(expert opinion), I can confidently say there is a<br />90% chance the Fed will cut rates in September.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (65%): After reading<br />articles and becoming slightly more informed on<br />the topic, a lot of experts have weighted in and<br />said that the feds will cut rates down by .25%. My<br />finance friend said that her professor explained<br />that probably won't happen because of the director<br />of the fed reserve, so I was slightly confused.<br />But after revising some of the information again<br />(and trusting my gut feeling which is probably not<br />a good idea) I'm going with 65.","Matthew Harvey (85%): There are a lot of factors<br />that are going into this decision. First and<br />foremost. The fed chair signals “Time Has Come”<br />for the September meeting. They are hinting at<br />cutting the interest rates on September the 18th.<br />The FOMC has also added in the previous July<br />meeting that all participants are supporting a<br />funds rate cut. Every news sources is saying that<br />the fed interest rate cut is highly likely. I<br />have hardly any doubt that this is going to occur.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Vikram Bharadwaj (99%): It is clear to me that<br />with the market predicting with a virtually 100%<br />consensus that rates are going to be cut, that<br />this event is going to occur. Both Powell and<br />many other higher-ups in the Federal Reserve have<br />strongly hinted at rate cuts, and nearly every<br />graphic and estimation shows that now is the time<br />for rate cuts.","William Willis (95%): The fact that we have an<br />unemployment rate that is trending higher than<br />usual, our inflation rate is relatively high,<br />looking at the history shows that we will have a<br />cut. I found all of the unemployment rates from<br />the last 20 years, the inflation rate from the<br />last 20 years, and the fed rates for the last 20<br />years, and then when the rate cuts occurred. I<br />looked at them all side by side and found a trend<br />in the numbers. Each rate cut had a trend of high<br />unemployment rate and low inflation rate. I also<br />looked up information and found the Jerome Powell<br />stated that the “time has come to cut rates”, to<br />CNBC. There for which great certainty with what<br />the numbers are telling me I gave it a probability<br />of 95%.","Minha Ahmad (75%): I would say that the<br />probability is 75% due to several expert opinions.<br />Forbes, Reuters, and Fortune are just some among<br />many networks that have reported predictions that<br />there will be cuts.","Leo Zegarra (85%): The federal reserve chair,<br />Jerome Powell, has already given a speech on<br />what will occur. He made it clear that \"the<br />central bank was poised to cut interest rates in<br />September\" (New York Times). That was on August<br />23rd. However, he did claim on July 31st that \"the<br />market needs to stay [the way that it is].\" For<br />that reason, there is some doubt. Realistically,<br />however, with it being closer to the 09/17 and<br />09/18 meeting date and with Powell not only<br />saying there will be a cut but also discussing<br />specifically how much of a cut there will be, I am<br />leaning more towards yes.","Reece Slater (88%): I looked at personal<br />interviews and speeches given by Jerome Powell<br />which indicate almost certainty that the fed will<br />cut rates. I also looked at data by traders which<br />indicate close to a 100% chance that the fed<br />will cut rates by September. All sources that I<br />investigated are almost certain that the fed will<br />cut rates, the question is just a matter of how<br />much and what the impacts will be.","Alex Vrolijk (80%): Inflation has continued to<br />drop closer to the target 2% goal as the federal<br />interest rates remain high at over 5%. The fed<br />was already considering lowering interest rates<br />at their July meeting but decided not to. It has<br />been stated that a vast majority of Fed officials<br />believe a cut is likely in the upcoming meeting.","Findleigh Ague (79%): Interest rates have been<br />raised 11 times since March 2022 to counteract<br />inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee<br />meets several times throughout the year to discuss<br />different topics such as interest rates, but so<br />far, they have declined to lower them. Although<br />this is true, inflation is currently at the lowest<br />rate (2.9%) that it has been since March 2021.<br />Additionally, the Consumer Price Index has fallen<br />to 3%, which is reflective of lower inflation<br />rates, as on average, consumers are paying less.<br />When the CPI fell, the Fed projected that interest<br />rates would be cut to 5.1% by the end of the year.<br />Also, the CME FedWatch tracker predicts that at<br />the FOMC's September 17th and 18th meeting, there<br />is a 69.5% chance that interest rates will be cut<br />to 5-5.25%.

It must also never join<br />NATO or develop nuclear weapons for a ceasefire<br />to be agreed to as well. These were extremely<br />unreasonable demands at the time, as Ukraine would<br />never agree to those requirements. As the year<br />progressed, Ukraine made advancements in Russia<br />in an attempt to push them towards a ceasefire.<br />Despite that, I don't see either country giving up<br />unless one side takes extremely heavy losses.","Erin Ho (35%): Honestly, this is a number I came<br />to after reading some of the reports and being<br />pessimistic. With Putin’s terms for a complete<br />ceasefire, it does not look very promising<br />considering it is asking for the complete<br />surrender of Ukrainian regions and Ukraine to<br />give up entering NATO. President Zelensky compared<br />it to Hitler’s actions in Czechoslovakia, and<br />it doesn’t look like Putin will accept any other<br />conditions. I wanted to make the percentage lower,<br />but I think this is a good number.","Minha Ahmad (40%): This summer, Putin made several<br />comments regarding a ceasefire, however, he was<br />also demanding that Ukraine handed over certain<br />regions. It seems that Russia will be more adamant<br />in regards to their demands, and I do not see a<br />ceasefire agreement occurring by December 1st.","Abby Crowe (5%): I only give a 5% chance that<br />Russia and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire<br />before December 1st. I am basing this prediction<br />on both the unwillingness to compromise from<br />Russia and the resolve that Ukraine has shown<br />since the war broke out. Additionally, Russia is<br />a veto member of the UN Security Council, and will<br />strike down any proposed ceasefire resolutions<br />that do not benefit Russia. They are pitted<br />against the rest of the permanent 5 member on the<br />council who are supporting Ukraine, and therefore<br />one of the most common pathways to ceasefire in<br />history is at a complete standstill. Additionally,<br />Ukraine has launched a counter-offensive, proving<br />their will and ability to stay at war for the<br />time being. Considering all these factors,<br />the probability of a ceasefire anytime soon is<br />extremely low.","Simon Gersten (10%): Explanation in brief.<br />Basically, Russia making gains, Ukraine backed by<br />countries that will not let it fall. Don't fight<br />the Russians in winter.","Hayden Morehouse (26%): This is a conflict that<br />has been going on since 2022 now. After some<br />research it seems that Putin would like to reach<br />a ceasefire instead of just a pause with Ukraine.<br />However, he challenges the legitimacy of Ukraine<br />as a state. This war is very expensive and violent<br />for both sides. However these things can drag on<br />without reaching a formal ceasefire that’s why I<br />am keeping my prediction low.","Jessica Armour (33%): Based on recent news<br />articles of speakers for Ukraine stating that<br />they plan on indefinitely holding the territory in<br />Russia, I would say it is very unlikely that this<br />territory is given up before December 1, which is<br />the only condition Putin had for ceasefire. Also<br />based on the amount of time that has passed since<br />this conflict has started and the limited amount<br />of success either has had on ceasefire I would<br />say this event yields a 33 in probability for it<br />occurring, as more than likely it will not.","Liv Payne (15%): After extended research on the<br />topic, it seems highly unlikely that Russia or<br />Ukraine would agree to a ceasefire. Putin has<br />made \"an attempt\" at negotations, but Zelensky<br />will accept nothing less than complete withdrawal.<br />However, as the US election nears, we will know<br />more. The removal of US troops (which is likely<br />to occur if Trump wins) seems to guarantee a<br />Ukrainian defeat, whereas if Ukraine is permitted<br />into NATO, Russia would be quickly overwhelmed by<br />other forces. In either case, it seems unlikely<br />for things to change before December 1st, as many<br />predict the war continuing into early 2025.","Gracie Culpepper (17%): Ultimately, the<br />probability number that I am deciding to lock<br />in for this question is 17%. This is a very low<br />number, but my first reason for this is that both<br />leaders of these countries are very determined<br />to get the results they want. Neither of these<br />people want to lose the trust of their citizens,<br />and I think that is playing a big role in the<br />continuation of this war. Another reason is that<br />just this past May people thought a ceasefire<br />would occur and it never did. Both of these<br />countries have such a deep history with each other<br />and have a severe amount of nationalistic pride,<br />that I just don’t see a ceasefire occurring before<br />December 1st being that probable.","Vikram Bharadwaj (35%): At the center of this war<br />is the Donbas region of Ukraine. With the Russian<br />proposed ceasefire from June 15th was completely<br />rejected by Kyiv due to how obscene it is when<br />it regards the Donbas region and Crimea. And with<br />the recent drone strike, I doubt that a ceasefire<br />is on the minds of Ukrainians right now. However<br />given the possibility of the US pulling support<br />for Ukraine, there is still a significantly<br />possible chance that there would be a ceasefire<br />agreement.","Alexis Frazer (10%): The conflict between Russia<br />and Ukraine has been ongoing since early 2014. In<br />a speech on 14 June 2024, Putin outlined Russia's<br />terms for a ceasefire. He said that Russia would<br />not negotiate unless Ukraine handed over the<br />provinces of Ukraine claimed by Russia, including<br />the parts Russia does not control. It seems<br />extremely unlikely for Ukraine to back down now<br />especially with the assistance from the US.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): I think that there is a<br />25% likelihood that Russia and Ukraine will agree<br />to a ceasefire before Dec 1 because unexpected<br />diplomatic breakthroughs or changes in military<br />dynamics could occur, but there are significant<br />challenges that make a ceasefire unlikely in the<br />immediate future.","Corinne O'Dell (25%): I think the polarization<br />between the two countries is too strong and there<br />is too much deep history for a ceasefire in the<br />next coming months.","Haley Ford (10%): It does not seem likely that<br />this would occur-Russia gave Ukraine an ultimatum<br />that Ukraine viewed as “Hitler-like” per Zelensky,<br />who in turn will not negotiate until Russian<br />forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including<br />Crimea. Thus, after approaching about day 1000 of<br />war, a ceasefire agreement seems unlikely still.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (25%): At first, whenever<br />you look up \"will Russia and Ukraine agree<br />to a ceasefire,\" Microsoft Bing says yes. But<br />when you look at the article being cited, it is<br />from 2021. This sort of resonates with what the<br />reading for this week said. After reading some<br />sources, a ceasefire would be a smart move for<br />Russia, as public support for the war in Russia<br />has decreased significantly, and Putin tends to<br />care about support ratings. However, in order<br />for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, they request<br />Ukraine to withdraw from the 4 regions Russia<br />claims and to drop aspirations to join NATO. These<br />are requests that Ukraine will probably not agree<br />on. Recently, Ukraine launched an incursion which<br />was (obviously) not received well by Russia. But,<br />Ukraine is using this as an opportunity to force<br />Russia to come back into a peace talk. If the<br />West gets too involved, by sending military aid or<br />weapons of any kind, or attempts to join the peace<br />talks discussions, Russia will not agree. TLDR:<br />At the end of the day, I think that a ceasefire<br />before December 1 is unlikely.","Brooke Mcdermott (24%): I was looking at the<br />current status of the news on Ukraine and Russia,<br />and Russia most recently has seemed resistant to<br />peace talks due to wanting to maintain control<br />of intercepted Ukrainian lands. Additionally,<br />just today Russia bombed Ukraine and killed 51<br />individuals and wounded over 100. Just recently,<br />Putin just announced that Russia's nuclear<br />weapons policy is bound to change, insinuating<br />that Russian forces do not plan on submitting<br />anytime soon. Historically, some Ukrainian news<br />sources and analysts predicted, based on studies<br />of military conflicts over the last two centuries,<br />that the war would be roughly 7-8 months.","John Mathis (15%): I think that Russia and Ukraine<br />have shown no signs of being open to making a<br />peace deal and I doubt that will change anytime<br />soon, since according to Al-jazeera, Ukraine<br />demands that all previously seized territories<br />including the lands from the 2014 Crimea<br />invasion. Furthermore, Russia has started to make<br />more grounds in Ukraine after the end of their<br />counterattack, and unless Putin is completely<br />ousted from power, which seems unlikely given<br />his ties with China and control of the oligarchs.<br />Overall, given the small chance that putin is<br />ousted and the war ends, I give it about a 15%<br />chance.","Colin Barry (15%): I think the chances of a<br />ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine are low at<br />around a 15% chance. This is because of Putin's<br />statements this year that he would only agree to<br />a ceasefire that respects the current land changes<br />after the last couple years of conflict. I don't<br />think this is a deal that a U.S. backed Ukraine<br />would be willing to accept, and would instead seek<br />out a return of all the land lost in the conflict.","William Willis (42%): I came up with this number<br />because I talked to a marine this summer who had<br />a friend who lived in Ukraine and he said that he<br />doesn't see the war stopping anytime soon. He said<br />that the Ukraine economy is propped up on the War.<br />As long as the US keeps sending supplies the war<br />will continue.","David Daniels (35%): This question, in particular,<br />has been challenging for me. I've consulted with<br />several self-proclaimed 'international conflict<br />experts,' and they all seem to agree on one thing:<br />nothing significant will happen until the USA<br />takes decisive action. From what I've read and<br />heard, Putin will likely test his limits until<br />this election season concludes and the political<br />landscape becomes clearer. Given that the current<br />political leadership appears weak, I doubt any<br />steps will be taken toward a ceasefire. My main<br />concern, however, is the territory Ukraine has<br />seized in Russia. Although this occupation is<br />relatively small compared to Russia's hold on<br />Ukrainian land, it might still exert pressure on<br />Putin from his oligarchs. This is why I estimate<br />the probability at 35%.","Leo Zegarra (10%): I gave a really low probability<br />due to both sides having strong, conflicting<br />goals and continuing to engage heavily in the<br />conflict without finding any real middle ground<br />whatsoever. Russia is determined to maintain<br />control over certain territories and keep its<br />influence in Ukraine, while Ukraine insists on<br />a full withdrawal of Russian troops and will<br />not leave the territories that Putin wants them<br />to exit. Even though there is pressure from the<br />international community to end the fighting, and<br />both sides are feeling the strain of war, they<br />each believe they still have something to gain by<br />continuing. Without a clear military a big change<br />in strategy, a ceasefire is not likely anytime<br />soon, especially within 2 months.","Findleigh Ague (23%): Based on what I've read<br />on the current state of relations between Russia<br />and Ukraine, it does not seem that Putin nor<br />Zelenskyy are ready to meet each other's terms to<br />come to a ceasefire. Putin's demands would require<br />Ukraine to give up too much of their sovereignty,<br />which is an ultimatum that they are not willing<br />to fulfill. Right before the 2024 Ukraine Peace<br />Summit was held, Putin released a statement saying<br />that Russia would ceasefire once Ukrainian troops<br />are removed from the four territories that they<br />perviously annexed and abandon all plans to join<br />NATO. Zelenskyy obviously is not willing to do<br />something as this, as he compared these words and<br />actions to those of Hitler. For these reasons, I<br />don't see that it is very likely that both Russia<br />and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire before<br />December 1st.","Abigail Harris (10%): Russia is demanding<br />significant land claim acknowledgment from<br />Ukraine. Ukraine wants full recognition of its<br />borders. The larger international community<br />doesn't want to anger Russia as far as the P5 is<br />concerned. The UN is useless because Russia has<br />veto power. I believe we've reached a familiar<br />precedent as far as Russia and other former Soviet<br />states are concerned. America and France are happy<br />to continue monetarily supporting Ukraine against<br />their former foe, but the reality is that Ukraine<br />is not in a position to be making demands, and<br />Russia has to think about the larger optics and<br />the desire for actually usable land and people<br />to labor on it. I would rather have money if I<br />pulled a single red ball out of a hat with nine<br />green balls than if Russia and Ukraine reached<br />a ceasefire. The ten percent is really only<br />there if the US somehow camp davids the two in<br />a never before seen stroke of post 2020 American<br />government competency.","Reece Slater (18%): I compiled speeches and<br />interviews from both Putin and Zelensky as well<br />as opinions from experts regarding the conflict.<br />I think this conflict will last well into 2025.<br />It is important to consider the motives of these<br />two leaders, especially Putin who is leading<br />the offensive. I don't think they will have an<br />incentive to negotiate a ceasefire until their<br />army cannot produce the arms at a quick enough<br />rate to continue. This is beginning to happen, but<br />I do not think it will happen before Dec 1.","Victor Avila (5%): Russia recently struck a<br />Ukrainian hospital and military academy killing<br />50 and wounding over 200. Zelensky also stated<br />that Ukraine will be holding onto the Kursk region<br />in Russia for the time being. That being said, I<br />think its best to bet against a ceasefire before<br />the date, considering the lack of progress thats<br />been made.","Matthew Harvey (25%): I believe that a great<br />deal leading into my percentage arrived from<br />events that occurred on September 3rd. Russia<br />shot 2 ballistic missiles into Ukraine and had<br />a confirm kill rate of 46 people. These weren't<br />military officers but rather civilians. I believe<br />that chances of a cease-fire went up in smoke<br />after such a strike. There might have been higher<br />chances before, however this attack is all but<br />going to stir up more conflict. This is also<br />based upon Ukraine not wanting to give up Russian<br />territory they have claimed. Both sides are not<br />willing to do things that would lead to eventual<br />peace talks.","Rommy Etzion (22%): All partial-ceasefire<br />negotiations in the past have either failed<br />largely (humanitarian corridor) or momentarily<br />worked and quickly fell. Russian previous<br />conditions involved maximalist demands with little<br />concession. The most recent negotiation regarding<br />energy facilities was derailed due to a surprise<br />inclusion by Ukraine, and because of that Russia<br />has vowed not to soften his position. Neither<br />state trusts each other, both have refused to<br />concede, and have yet to successfully discuss a<br />partial-ceasefire to specific sectors of the war.<br />A full ceasefire is even less likely. That being<br />said, military analysts have expressed skepticism<br />that Ukrainians forces can maintain control over<br />Russian territory, and concern on whether they<br />can survive this winter in Russian bombardment on<br />energy continued. This will raise the likelihood<br />of a ceasefire.","Sara Whitmire (5%): I don’t see a ceasefire<br />happening anytime soon. This conflict is seen<br />as one of the most devastating wars in Europe<br />since WWII, based on a deep, historical conflict<br />that can’t be solved within a few months.<br />Moreover, this war is ultimately decided by<br />Putin and Zelensky, two world leaders with crazy<br />personalities and citizens to represent. if Putin<br />ends the war, he looks weak, and if Zelensky ends<br />the war, the fight for Ukraine dies entirely. To<br />be frank, this war won’t end until one of them<br />dies. I didn't estimate 0% because there is a<br />potential for condemnation from the UN or some<br />other miracle. The fight to take back Ukraine<br />is an effort to re-assert Russia as a global<br />superpower on the world stage, and with the US<br />election, chances for a ceasefire on Putin's part<br />are low.","Jeffrey Markowitz (10%): Fighting has continued<br />and showed no signs of stopping. Putin has shown<br />that he will not cooperate with a ceasefire unless<br />Ukraine gives up incredible amounts of land.<br />Ceasefires have been in talks, but little progress<br />has been made.","Kira Liscombe (10%): In June of this year, Putin<br />spoke on a ceasefire and called on the Ukrainian<br />government to withdraw from four regions partially<br />occupied by Russia - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson,<br />and Zaporizhzhia. He also said Ukraine would need<br />to officially give up in its efforts to join the<br />NATO military alliance for the Russian advance<br />to be halted. Despite these former negotiations,<br />Ukraine seems unwilling to comply with Russia's<br />ultimatum. I found an expert opinion from Ruth<br />Deyermond, senior lecturer in the Department<br />of War Studies at King's College London RFE/RL<br />claiming, \"It's always dangerous to make<br />predictions, but it's difficult to imagine the war<br />ending by the end of 2024\". Based on all of this<br />information, and the lack of any recent news on<br />cease-fire negotiations between the countries, I<br />predicted a very low probability that we will see<br />any ceasefire before December.","Carson Ankeny (20%): I do not think there is a<br />very high chance for a ceasefire. While there have<br />been attempts to negotiate one, they have been<br />unsuccessful so far. Even as the international<br />community tries to place pressure on Russia,<br />neither side wants to come to the table, because<br />neither side is willing to make concessions.","Alex Vrolijk (20%): This is because Putin has said<br />that he will only agree to a ceasefire if Ukraine<br />hands over four regions and stops any aspirations<br />to join NATO. I see this as highly unlikely and<br />since the war has been ongoing for so long it is<br />hard to believe there will be a ceasefire soon<br />with the attitudes of the country's leaders.","Franco Bravo (50%): I went for 50% just because<br />from what I know in this topic, Putin is an<br />incredibly radical and unpredictable man.<br />Furthermore, Ukraine has been making several<br />military advances into mainland Russia which would<br />make it much more likely for there to be peace<br />talks. In my opinion there will be Peace talks in<br />the near future but I am unsure whether one will<br />happen by December First","Ladi Fashogbon (30%): To me, both sides have<br />shown little sign of willingness to agree to<br />a comprehensive ceasefire. Russia continues to<br />pursue its strategic objectives, while Ukraine,<br />backed by Western support, remains focused on<br />defending its territory. Diplomatic efforts,<br />such as peace talks and negotiations mediated by<br />international organizations, have so far failed<br />to produce a lasting agreement. Both sides have<br />specific conditions that the other is unwilling to<br />meet, making a ceasefire challenging."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":145.38812785388131},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Russia and Ukraine<br />agree to a ceasefire<br />before Dec 1?"],"tickvals":[1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Russia and Ukraine<br />agree to a ceasefire<br />before Dec 1?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"12702d574fcc":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"1270f1e6b85":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"12702d574fcc","visdat":{"12702d574fcc":["function (y) ","x"],"1270f1e6b85":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

For<br />death rates to reach this level, either the<br />virulence or case fatality rate would have to<br />increase dramatically compared to last winter<br />(when weekly death rates were less than half<br />that).

I feel like this feeling will<br />remain as they understand how valuable of an asset<br />TikTok is for the company. The algorithm behind<br />the app is crucial to its function and ByteDance<br />is set on keeping that first and foremost. The<br />company has also stated that they would rather<br />a shutdown in the US rather than selling. A<br />major complication as well is the outcome of the<br />November election as Trump has come out and said<br />that he will allow TikTok to continue being used<br />in the US. This makes it even less likely that the<br />company even has to sell in the first place.","Liv Payne (10%): All articles that I found were<br />from June 2024 or earlier, around the time when<br />the US government was making the decision to ban<br />TikTok. ByteDance was given the \"sell or ban\"<br />option, but have said that they will fight the<br />\"unconstitutional law\" in court. Also, if the ban<br />did go into effect, it would not be until 2025, as<br />they were given nine months from the decision to<br />sell. Therefore, I believe it highly unlikely that<br />they will sell.","Erin Ho (10%): Whenever the TikTok ban was first<br />passed in April of this year, ByteDance had<br />announced they had no intentions of selling their<br />platform to any US companies. Instead, they sued<br />the US government over the potential ban and will<br />challenge them over how constitutional this is.<br />I do not think ByteDance will sell, whether they<br />win, lose, or the case gets tossed out, because<br />TikTok is used everywhere else in the world and<br />is well-established as a social media platform.<br />I also believe that there is a benefit to having<br />a social media platform that is not controlled by<br />any US tech company.","Jessica Armour (10%): ByteDance released a<br />statement earlier in the year that they have no<br />intentions of selling the platform TikTok, along<br />with this, since the \"sell or ban\" measure was<br />created there seems to be even more push back<br />when it comes to whether or not they will sell.<br />Along with this, taking into consideration the<br />vast amount of times the selling of TikTok has<br />been brought up and has never went through I would<br />say it is highly unlikely that ByteDance will<br />sell. TikTok generates too much money and is too<br />influential for the stakeholder to sell.","Abby Crowe (10%): I predict a 10% chance that<br />ByteDance will announce a deal before December<br />1st. I give a low chance because the company has<br />said directly that they have no plans to sell,<br />and are willing to challenge the US legislation in<br />the court system. Because of the timeline of our<br />courts, and their direct rejection of the idea of<br />selling, I find it highly unlikely that this event<br />will occur in the given timeline.","Haley Ford (20%): This forecasting challenge is<br />more difficult to interpret, however I think the<br />short timeframe makes it slightly easier. Court<br />proceedings could prolong any sale of TikTok and<br />thus I believe it has a low chance of being sold<br />before the December 1st deadline. Additionally,<br />the bill itself gave TikTok till January, which<br />I believe Bytedance would wait to the very end<br />if they were to sell. Thus, I believe there is a<br />20% likelihood of Bytedance selling TikTok before<br />December 1st.","Simon Gersten (10%): Given that Bytedance has<br />said they will not sell the app as the algorithm<br />is central to their business model, it is highly<br />unlikely they will sell the app by Dec. 1. It is<br />far more likely that they will continue to exhaust<br />all legal avenues which could take several years<br />in the courts.","Corinne O'Dell (20%): Given all of the factors<br />surrounding a sale of TikTok, the likelihood of<br />a sale by December 1, 2024 seems highly unlikely.<br />This is because of ByteDance’s continued legal<br />fights, the magnitude of the sale, and the<br />Chinese’s government's stake in the app. TikTok<br />is worth a valued 100 billion, so ByteDance has no<br />incentive to sell the app, as they could continue<br />making money even if the app shutdown in the US.<br />The situation remains dynamic, so there is still a<br />chance that the sale could happen within the next<br />few months. The timeframe is also too short for<br />them to be able to get through a legal battle by<br />Dec 1.","Reece Slater (16%): According to a statement<br />released by ByteDance earlier this year, they have<br />stated that they would rather have TikTok shutdown<br />in the United States than sell it. I also think<br />they are heavily relying on the courts to shut<br />this law down. TikTok is also a very hard entity<br />to dollar amount to and I think it will take a<br />long time to negotiate this even if they agree to<br />sell. Yes, they must sell it very soon in order<br />to avoid shutdown by law, but I don't think they<br />will.","Kira Liscombe (10%): According to the legislation<br />signed into law that bans TikTok unless sold to<br />a non-Chinese company, the sale deadline will<br />come sometime in 2025. This is after the winner<br />of the 2024 presidential election takes office,<br />which might have an impact on whether or not<br />the ban is implemented. Multiple media outlets<br />reported in April that ByteDance has no plans to<br />sell the platform, and it appears they have made<br />no statements saying otherwise since. Based on<br />this and the fact that Dec. 1 will come before the<br />final cutoff for the sale to occur, I predict a<br />very low probability that ByteDance will announce<br />any deal to sell TikTok.","Vikram Bharadwaj (15%): If this question was<br />asking whether or not Tiktok would be BANNED<br />in the US, there would be an entirely different<br />outlook on this question. However, the base<br />question of whether it will be sold is entirely<br />easier to answer. First off, based on the lack of<br />international precedent, no US law could force an<br />MNC to just be sold, especially when it concerns<br />such a strong international power in China.<br />With a massive decrease in public care for this<br />TikTok ban, it is becoming abundantly clear that<br />Bytedance will not only not sell TikTok, but will<br />likely not even be banned in the US. Financially<br />it doesn't make sense for them to sell this<br />platform when it is in the strongest growth period<br />ever, and frankly there is real chance they will.","Shayna Van Glish (15%): I think that there is a<br />15% chance that there is a deal to sell TikTok,<br />as it does not seem likely that ByteDance will<br />announce before Dec 1. The company has been<br />consistently resistant to selling TikTok and might<br />even prefer shutting it down rather than selling.","Jeffrey Markowitz (25%): There are multiple<br />articles discussing Bitedance would rather shut<br />down tiktok than sell it in december. There have<br />been no updates since.","Brooke Mcdermott (16%): TikTok representatives and<br />Bytedance representatives have been very resistant<br />to the push that the U.S. government has been<br />pressing on them to sell or they will be banned<br />in the U.S. In addition to this, they are in an<br />on-going legal battle that discusses the first<br />amendment rights of the company in terms of their<br />censorship, and there has been many discussions<br />about data and Chinese involvement. Bytedance made<br />strong claims that they will not sell in April,<br />and more recently have made various statements<br />about their constitutional rights and readmitting<br />their firm stance. Pew Research Center made a<br />study as recently as Sep. 5th that at least 50%<br />of Americans do not think the app will be banned,<br />and additionally, there is a consistent decline<br />in support of the TikTok ban since April. However,<br />the app does receive the most revenue from the<br />U.S. in comparison to other countries. This may<br />lead to some sort of deal in which they sell, but<br />I doubt that this would lead to a deal rather than<br />more time in suits.","Edward Tsui (15%): Despite 16 billion revenue from<br />US markets, ByteDance, the parent company, prefers<br />a TikTok shutdown in the US if legal options fail<br />come January 25th, 2025 according to Reuters. On<br />April 23rd-24th, 2024 Congress passed a bill to<br />ban Tik Tok in the United States; President Biden<br />then signed the bill. With over 30 states banning<br />the app on government devices, and the app being<br />banned by the US military and its members, hope<br />does not look good for the Chinese-owned company.<br />I do not think the US will be successful in a<br />forced sell by December 1st.","Colin Barry (30%): I would say that Bytedance<br />agreeing to a deal to sell TikTok by December 1st<br />would be unlikely, as the company stated in April<br />that they had no plans to sell. This is because<br />the source algorithm the app runs on is allegedly<br />vital to the function of their company, which has<br />made them hesitant to part ways with it. I also do<br />not think that a deal would be made until sooner<br />to the deadline for them to sell, which falls<br />on January 19th. This is almost two months after<br />the December 1st deadline for our forecasting<br />question.","Alexis Frazer (15%): While Biden did sign a law in<br />April of 2024 saying Tiktok will be banned if not<br />sold, there has been little to no indication of<br />urgent plans ByteDance has to sell the app. There<br />is still possibility for it to happen which is why<br />I choose 15%.","Gracie Culpepper (20%): I'm saying 20 because<br />based off of what I read I just don't think it<br />will be super probable. I also think that the<br />election and how TikTok has been in US politics<br />for a minute now will have some affect over this<br />and I just don't think it is super likely.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): ByteDance has explicitly<br />stated their will to not divest from Tik Tok by<br />the January 2025 deadline. Despite the Tik Tok and<br />Fortnite App on the Apple Store being different<br />scenarios, I believe that ByteDance will continue<br />to stand firm despite pressures. ByteDance is also<br />taking this ban decision through the court system.<br />Tik Tok and the DOJ asked for a ruling by Dec. 6<br />meaning the ban could be overturned or confirmed<br />passed the Dec. 1 deadline for this forecast. With<br />the hope of a possible ban overturn by SCOTUS, I<br />do not think ByteDance will change its stance on<br />divestment until the court's ruling.","David Daniels (15%): I don’t think ByteDance will<br />sell TikTok before December 1st because they seem<br />more focused on fighting the U.S. government’s<br />demands rather than selling. They’ve got until<br />January 2025 to either sell or face a ban, so<br />the urgency isn’t immediate. Selling TikTok<br />without its core algorithm is also a headache,<br />and ByteDance isn't eager to give competitors<br />that advantage. The platform makes most of its<br />money outside the U.S., which lowers the pressure.<br />I’d put the odds of a sale happening by December<br />1st at just 15%. This probability of mine is<br />also supported by the notion that ByteDance has<br />outright declared they would rather be banned<br />then sell their controlling interest. My only<br />reluctancy regarding this is rumors of backroom<br />negotiations between American interests and<br />ByteDance.","Findleigh Ague (24%): ByteDance seems pretty<br />adamant that they will not be selling TikTok<br />to a U.S. company. The algorithm that TikTok<br />operates on is crucial to how the app is able to<br />generate revenue and provide for its users, so<br />selling the app to a company that would change<br />its functionality in order to stop storing data<br />and protect Americans’ privacy would completely<br />change how the app works. For this reason, in<br />the case that they haven’t come to any sort of<br />agreement, they wouldn’t want to keep the app and<br />have to change this algorithm in order to keep<br />American customers because they don’t account<br />for that large of a share of their revenue and<br />users anyway. They would rather just let the<br />app be banned in the U.S. because it wouldn’t<br />leave a huge impact on the company. I think that<br />if anything, they might come to some sort of<br />agreement, but I don’t think that they will be<br />selling the app, especially not by December 1st,<br />as they have until January 19th to sell.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (10%): If we are talking<br />about ByteDance announcing to sell TikTok to<br />the US, I am confident that this probably won't<br />happen. ByteDance has said, \"ByteDance doesn't<br />have any plans to sell TikTok.\" That is what gives<br />me confidence. But then again, I do not want to<br />be over confident, so I looked into ByteDance's<br />blog (useless). I also read an NYT article about<br />it. This article gave me a more solid background<br />of why the sale is unlikely rather than only<br />ByteDance's statement. According to the article,<br />if ByteDance were to sell TikTok, companies<br />like Google or Microsoft would be able to afford<br />it, but they are likely to run into antitrust<br />concerns. I think that a global sale of TikTok<br />might be more likely than an US sale.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): According to the research<br />I did ByteDance has no intention of selling the<br />app. These legal proceedings can take a very long<br />time and they do not want to give up what is maybe<br />the most popular social media app available. I<br />just don’t see it happening any time soon.","Leo Zegarra (20%): Because the \"deadline\" to<br />sell TikTok is after December 1st, I truly<br />don't believe ByteDance will announce a deal to<br />sell TikTok before December 1. This is because<br />ByteDance has consistently resisted selling<br />TikTok, showing their dedication towards leaving<br />it be and not really abiding by anyone else's<br />demands. Although the U.S. has put serious<br />pressure for a sale, it also isn;t until some<br />time in January, making it less likely to happen<br />since they would have a a month or so more to<br />arrange for that to occur. Additionally, the<br />geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China<br />add complexity, making it difficult to reach a<br />deal that satisfies all parties involved. Thus the<br />reason for my 20% probability.","William Willis (33%): I selected 33% probability<br />for this because I don't think it can happen<br />because the purchase makes no sense for your<br />business model or it makes too much sense to be<br />legal. Tik Tok has continued to make revisions to<br />their privacy policy. I believe that this shows<br />that they are motivated to keep the app appealing<br />to Americans. I came up with the number 33%<br />because I don't think that a decision could be<br />made by December 1. I think that the presidential<br />election will play into this and will not be dealt<br />with until afterward. Also the owner of ByteDance<br />said in April that he denies it's willing to sell<br />Tik Tok as US ban looms.","Rommy Etzion (40%): It is not unlikely that they<br />will sell, but I believe it to be more likely<br />that they will refuse and take it to the court.<br />While there are millions of users in the US,<br />TikTok is extremely popular worldwide. They will<br />challenge the ban in court, and if lose they may<br />want to keep their company and accept the US ban<br />on selling. Additionally, President Biden set a<br />January 19th deadline for the sale, right when<br />Bidens presidential term ends. I do not believe<br />that ByteDance will sell Tiktok a month before<br />that deadline, and I don’t believe the United<br />States will place much pressure on them to do so<br />during the height of the election leading up to<br />that deadline.","Abigail Harris (40%): Bytedance has repeatedly<br />claimed they would rather shut down tiktok than<br />sell it to a U.S. owned company. Also, the current<br />wording that Biden signed into law as part of<br />an emergency foreign aid relief package doesn't<br />come into effect until January 19th 2025, giving<br />ByteDance plenty of time to challenge the law<br />on first amendment grounds like they're claiming<br />they want to do or sell Tiktok later on after<br />December. I also don't think this is something<br />the US is going to push in the immediate future<br />seeing as how more than 60% of their stock is<br />internationally owned and in part by Blackrock<br />investing. So it's not like the CIA isn't eating<br />their cake anyway here.","Matthew Harvey (12%): The Chinese company known<br />as Bytedance has already stated that they would<br />rather have TikTok shut down rather than be<br />sold to a US company. Considering TikTok is a<br />major platform for the United States, it makes<br />sense that they would attempt to buy the massive<br />media platform. This comes after the Biden<br />administration created a ban on the app in order<br />to try to force the company to ban the app.<br />Considering the app has control over the data<br />processing of the app and other information they<br />gather. The deadline for Bytedance to sell their<br />app is in April of 2025 and it is incredibly<br />doubtful they will give in to a country they<br />consider to be a rival of.","Minha Ahmad (10%): There is a very low possibility<br />that ByteDance will sell TikTok by December 1st.<br />There have been several reports and articles since<br />April of 2024 stating that ByteDance has no plans<br />to sell, and would rather shut down TikTok in the<br />U.S. if required to than sell their company.","John Mathis (15%): ByteDance has made it<br />abundantly clear that they will not sell tiktok.<br />Additionally, The US isn't even the largest user<br />base for tiktok, and it makes up only a fraction<br />of their total downloads. Additionally, 80% of<br />their sales on the Tiktok Shop come from southeast<br />asia, meaning the US market will not impact the<br />sales of Tiktok as much as people may believe.<br />Given this information, I doubt tiktok will sell<br />before Dec. 1","Victor Avila (30%): In April of 2024, Joe Biden<br />announced that Bytedance has 270 days to sell its<br />recently-emerging, hit social media app, Tik Tok<br />due to the scares of the Chinese government being<br />able to access user-sensitive data. If Bytedance<br />does not sell the app, it will be banned in the<br />United States. Recently Bytedance stated that<br />is does not intend to sell Tiktok especially<br />considering the app reached $16.1 billion dollars<br />in annual revenue. Also, due to tension between<br />China and the United States escalating I do not<br />foresee any leniency for the company when the time<br />comes.","Franco Bravo (25%): Due to the complex<br />geopolitical nature of this deal, I believe<br />that it is highly unlikely that Byte dance will<br />announce a sale by December 1. I do not think that<br />Bytedance will fold to the political pressures of<br />the US government. Additionally, the criticisms<br />that the public has shown has made it even more<br />difficult. iF there is any sale, then I believe it<br />will be postponed and not be announced by December<br />first.","Carson Ankeny (10%): Due to public statements that<br />the company would rather be forced to shutdown<br />in the US than be forced to make a sale, I think<br />it is highly unlikely that they sell. Company<br />leadership has been very adamant that a sale will<br />not happen, and for that reason I am not confident<br />that there would be a sale. Their algorithm is too<br />important for them to be willing to sell.","Jessica Armour (25%): Throughout all the trends<br />of deaths caused by COVID-19 there has yet to be<br />a week with 3,000 deaths in over a year. The most<br />recent weeks have had less than 1,000 deaths.<br />This leads me to believe that although possible it<br />is very unlikely that the weekly death rate will<br />reach 3,000 by Dec 1. With that being said, there<br />has been an uptick in the amount of COVID cases<br />within the past few months, so the probability is<br />not 0, yet it is still highly unlikely to occur.","Erin Ho (30%): Based on some recent articles and<br />reviewing the past weeks of weekly COVID-19 death<br />rates, I don’t think it’ll reach above 3,000.<br />I think it’ll get close, but not high enough.<br />There are still deaths happening, due to people<br />not getting the updated version of the vaccine<br />nor accessing available treatments for illness in<br />general. However, the last time we got close to<br />hitting 3,000 COVID-19 deaths was January 2024,<br />but since then it hasn’t gotten close at all.","Ryan Foley (15%): Currently, the weekly death rate<br />per 100 thousand people is 300.3. This rate covers<br />the last 3 months which is about the same amount<br />of time before the deadline for this question.<br />This means that the current rate would have the<br />10x before December 1st which is highly unlikely.<br />We have vaccines, better and more accurate<br />screening methods, and more people understand the<br />steps to take when the have Covid. Unless a new<br />mutation on the virus appears that is resistant to<br />the countermeasures we have developed, I don't see<br />a substantial increase in deaths occurring.","Brooke Mcdermott (18%): Studies show that the<br />death rates per week have been decreasing over<br />the years since vaccines have started to be<br />administered. That being said, there is a lot of<br />fluctuation between seasons and there tends to be<br />a huge peak in deaths around the end of December<br />and the start of January historically. With the<br />introduction of vaccines and other protocols since<br />the start of the pandemic, I believe that the<br />deaths will continue to decrease. That being said,<br />I felt like it was more likely to reach 3,000<br />given past data of spikes in the winter months.","Liv Payne (15%): I find unlikely that we will<br />experience a spike to 3000 deaths per week before<br />December 1st. Looking at CDC data, we can see a<br />trend of deaths decreasing over time. Our last<br />spike was in January of 2023, which was around<br />2500 deaths per week. However, that was following<br />a period of time where the deaths rose from 1400<br />in September. Currently, data is not available<br />for September 2024, so I used data from August to<br />make my prediction. As of August 31, 2.6% of COVID<br />cases resulted in death. In the past three months,<br />most states have had 100-199 deaths from COVID. In<br />the week before August 31, no states were over 8%<br />cases of death, and the majority range from 2-3.9%<br />to 1-9 counts. Therefore, I don't think that COVID<br />deaths will spike to 3000.","Simon Gersten (20%): With the increase in vaccine<br />availability accompanied with more prepared<br />medical units, the likelihood remains low that the<br />death count will reach over 3000 per week before<br />December 1st. While the colder months are likely<br />to increase the death count, it is unlikely that<br />it will go back up to 3000 per week.","Corinne O'Dell (8%): COVID-19 weekly death rates<br />in the United States are not expected to reach<br />3,000 or more per week before December 1, 2024,<br />based on current trends and expert projections.<br />According to the CDC, as of early September,<br />there are about 1,200-1,300 deaths per week​.<br />COVID deaths have been decreasing as time has<br />gone on, and in last December the weekly COVID-19<br />death toll in the U.S. varied, with early reports<br />indicating around 1,500 to 2,000 deaths per week.<br />This all indicates that the weekly rates will not<br />increase to 3,000 or above.","Findleigh Ague (62%): Based on data from both<br />the CDC and Our World in Data, it looks as though<br />COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. are still under 1000,<br />and they've been fluctuating around the 600-900s<br />since July 2024. The most recent data point they<br />have is as of August 31, 2024, there were 663<br />deaths that week. This past week, the percentage<br />of deaths related to COVID-19, was 2.6%. Also<br />this past week, the rate of COVID-19 related<br />deaths per 100,000 population (age-adjusted) was<br />0.2. Although this is true, I feel like it can be<br />pretty easy for the rates to rise to 3000. There<br />still isn't data from the week following Labor<br />Day weekend, so that along with the following<br />weeks could likely showcase an increase in<br />contaminations and then later on deaths because<br />of the increase in travel and gatherings of family<br />and friends. We have also seen nationally high<br />levels of COVID-19 in wastewater (8.82) going<br />into the school season. There was a peak during<br />the summer, but according to Andrea Garcia of the<br />American Medical Association, it's too early to<br />tell if this peak has truly passed. I think that<br />we will have to see how these next few weeks are<br />looking to make a more conclusive statement about<br />this, but regardless, I think it is relatively<br />likely that deaths will rise to 3000 since we<br />know that the virus spreads easily and quickly and<br />does so even more to those with compromised immune<br />systems.","Haley Ford (2%): I put 2/100 mainly based off the<br />weekly data provided by the CDC. The number of<br />COVID cases seem to increase in cooler months,<br />however last December the death count was about<br />1700 dated on December 2nd. (closet data point<br />to the 1st) In January, cases increased but still<br />remained under the 3,000 threshold, maxing out<br />at 2,578 on January 13. Given our forecast ends<br />before December begins, I feel more comfortable<br />putting a lower probability on this forecast.<br />Additionally, this years end of August is below<br />last years.","Gracie Culpepper (5%): I really think this is<br />unlikely. Last year the World Health Organization<br />reported that it was under 3k around this time<br />last year up until the end of 2023 in December.<br />Even throughout this entire year, so far the<br />maximum weekly death rate has not risen above<br />2.8k. I really think this is incredibly unlikely.","Hayden Morehouse (30%): I had a hard time finding<br />research for this but last year the totals did not<br />reach this point so I am going to make an estimate<br />based on those numbers since those would be the<br />most representative for this upcoming year.","Abby Crowe (20%): I predict a 20% chance that<br />COVID-19 weekly death rates in the US reach 3,000<br />or above before Dec 1. The last time covid deaths<br />spiked over 3,000 in one week was in March of<br />2023, over 1.5 years back from now. While covid<br />deaths are spiking because of flu season and time<br />of year, I still find it unlikely that the spike<br />will be that high at any point before December.","Vikram Bharadwaj (25%): I give this prediction a<br />25% confidence rating as compared to the previous<br />year, the number of deaths are down significantly,<br />however with the elections coming up and the<br />potential for many super-spreader like events,<br />there is a real chance that it could break into<br />the 3000s by December 1st. However the main reason<br />for the lack of confidence is the general data<br />trends and lack of a major factor (other than the<br />election) that would cause such a high spike in<br />deaths. If we look back to last year, we failed<br />to even break 3000 until January of this year,<br />much later in the heavy holiday travel season<br />than would be required for this event to come to<br />fruition.","William Willis (23%): I believe that there is a<br />23% chance that the weekly death rate from Covid<br />19 will exceed 3,000. I have reason to believe<br />this because I looked at the death rates per the<br />last 3 years. The last time it was at 3,000 was<br />1/21/23. My reason for selecting this number was<br />because this week is less than it was last year.<br />You catch covid from other people, so the less<br />people that have it, the less chances you have of<br />catching it. If this month is lower than last year<br />that could mean that fewer people could catch it<br />per month than previous years.","Kira Liscombe (12%): According to data I<br />found from the CDC, in late December of 2023<br />provisional COVID death counts by week in the<br />US reached 2,229. More recently in August of<br />2024, provisional COVID death counts by week<br />in the US only reached 663. Trends in United<br />States COVID-19 Deaths show spikes around every<br />late December/early January, but they have been<br />consistently shrinking each year. Additionally,<br />NBC reported that the Food and Drug Administration<br />has been following a routine similar to how the<br />annual flu shot is updated in administering the<br />COVID vaccine. With the presecense of a vaccine<br />this year, and overall low case trends seen in the<br />last two years, I predict a low probability that<br />the COVID-19 weekly death rate will reach 3,000<br />before Dec. 1.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): Weekly death rates have<br />been hovering around 700 for the past few weeks<br />now. There is no reason that should change in the<br />coming months.","Edward Tsui (30%): I think COVID-19 weekly death<br />rates in the United States have a chance to reach<br />3,000 before December 1st. According to the CDC,<br />overall COVID rates have downward trended. Covid<br />tends to soar in the December and colder months<br />of winter. However, I've noticed, that since the<br />pandemic, the rates of August tend to double in<br />the winter. Presently, I don't think the doubling<br />of August 2024 would reach 3,000. New York Times<br />report similar numbers. Overall, I think it's<br />a 50-50, but less than that, so I split the<br />difference and then some.","Shayna Van Glish (7%): I think that is it really<br />unlikely that the COVID-19 weekly death rates in<br />the US will exceed 3,000, as currently the rates<br />are only around 500. While it can increase with<br />flu season approaching, preventative measures will<br />keep it from reaching high levels. There also is<br />the added factor that there is widespread immunity<br />to COVID-19 from vaccinations and prior infection.","Colin Barry (40%): I think that it is about<br />an even chance but am leaning more towards it<br />being less than likely. This is because based on<br />previous years' trends where covid deaths reach<br />their weekly highs in the months following our<br />December1st deadline. However, I do think the<br />chance is as high as 40% since there is a much<br />stronger wave of covid hitting the U.S. currently<br />than there has been in these previously measured<br />years.","David Daniels (2%): I believe the weekly COVID-19<br />death rate in the U.S. will not reach 3,000 before<br />December 1, 2024, assigning a 2% chance. This<br />assessment is based on the observed downtrend in<br />COVID-19 deaths and the fact that monthly death<br />rates rarely exceed 3,000 let a lone weekly.<br />According to CDC data, the downward trend in<br />deaths supports this outlook, and that is why I am<br />confident with my 2% assigned probability.","Matthew Harvey (30%): I believe that there is<br />an unlikely chance that deaths will exceed 3000<br />before December the 1st. While I believe that<br />as we approach fall and colder temperatures<br />and as we approach flu season, sickness will<br />spread faster, I do believe that it is a lot<br />less likely for people to die now from Covid-19.<br />With the production of the vaccine being able<br />to combat the virus and citizens being aware<br />of symptoms, I believe it helps contribute to<br />lessening the factors and severity of COVID-19. I<br />cannot exclude potentials of having outbreaks and<br />flair ups, as well as mutations and more deadly<br />strands to happen. As of right now, according to<br />ourworlddata.org, as of August 18th, there were<br />757 deaths a week. This is down from 883 two weeks<br />prior, I believe this will fluctuate around the<br />upper 100’s and maybe into the low 1000’s, however<br />I don’t believe it will exceed 3000.","John Mathis (40%): Simply put, cases rise during<br />winter and I believe that Covid has reached a<br />flu-like status where a certain amount of people<br />will die from it every year. However, I do not<br />think it will rise enough to pass 3k deaths, as<br />last year it did not and they had a higher death<br />toll going into winter than we do now. It will<br />be close however, so I am putting 40 to hedge my<br />bets.","Leo Zegarra (0%): It is clear and obvious<br />that Shogun is the heavy favorites. Although I<br />have not watched any of the shows, practically<br />all the rankings for each series shows 3 Body<br />Problem being ranked last. So, given that they're<br />predicted to be last of 8, it shows that the<br />ranking sites are putting a massive 7 shows above<br />this series. It seems virtually impossible for<br />the show to actually win. Plus, they have a +1600<br />betting odds to win, the highest out of all the<br />shows. I will give my first 0% probability that<br />this will happen.","Ladi Fashogbon (35%): I took the derivative of<br />the provisional deaths given by the cdc records.<br />I saw based on the most recent data, it shows<br />fluctuations between +36.8% (on 8/24/2024) and<br />-18.3% (on 7/20/2024)., therefore this was abasis<br />for my data.","Victor Avila (40%): I do not believe that weekly<br />deaths from COVID-19 will reach 3,000. It seems<br />as though that COVID is a lot more common during<br />the hotter times of the year, when the virus<br />thrives. Not to mention, it seems like the virus<br />has somewhat stabilized in the recent months and I<br />think it will likely decrease as we head into the<br />winter.","Abigail Harris (30%): We are currently . It's been<br />almost since January of 2023 when a new variant<br />was prevalent, and Covid is growing in 7 states<br />while declining in 16 states, including 3 of<br />the most populous, including California, Texas,<br />and NY. I also don't think Covid will be mass<br />reported or incentivized to be reported by this<br />administration again before the election and Covid<br />and viruses are less active in the winter overall.","Franco Bravo (25%): After having done some<br />research, from the looks of it there has been an<br />increase in COVID weekly rates in the last couple<br />months. However I believe that the rate and number<br />at which COVID is going up in will reach 3000 by<br />December unless something very drastic were to<br />happen","Carson Ankeny (15%): According to all of the CDC<br />data I have seen it seems highly unlikely that the<br />death rate would rise. Especially at this point<br />in the pandemic death rates have been steadily<br />declining and even with a \"school spike\" it<br />doesn't seem likely to reach 3k.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): The last time the weekly<br />death rate was above three thousand was in January<br />2023 and since that December the death rate has<br />not been near 3,000. Unless a new variant strain<br />arises, I think it is very unlikely for the<br />rate to reach above three thousand. Even with a<br />possible spike due to thanksgiving travel, I do<br />not believe it will spike because it did not this<br />past summer either (summer being a season with a<br />lot of traveling).","Alexis Frazer (15%): Per CDC data and past trends,<br />in my briefing I cam eto the conclusion that it is<br />highly unprobable for COVID deaths to skyrocket in<br />the upcoming months before December 1st.","Hayden Morehouse (5%): I don't know anything about<br />this show or much about the emmys so I went with<br />ole reliable and looked up the vegas betting odds.<br />They had this show at the lowest probability so<br />I am going to take a gamble and say this is not<br />going to happen.","Abby Crowe (10%): I predict a 10% chance that the<br />show “3 Body Problem” will win the Emmy. They are<br />competing against 7 other shows, several of which<br />have far more nominations and publicity. If the<br />question were broader about the show winning any<br />Emmy this year, I would be more generous, but with<br />the specificity of the question, I find it highly<br />unlikely.","Minha Ahmad (60%): I think it is highly likely<br />that the show will win the Emmy due to its past<br />success. It was the most-watched show on Netflix<br />at the end of March. The show has also been<br />nominated for six emmys this season.","Ryan Foley (10%): A sci-fi show has never won<br />the Emmy for this category and there is too much<br />competition that beats 3 Body Problem this year.<br />Fallout and Shogun both have higher ratings and<br />are true to their source material. 3 Body Problem<br />on the other hand whitewashes its characters<br />and falls short of providing an accurate<br />representation of the story it draws from.","William Willis (8%): I read on Vanity fair that<br />the show Shōgun performed at the Creative Arts<br />Emmys and that you would be a fool not to predict<br />a win here. Apparently Shogun is dominating in<br />every category. I don't have any faith in 3 Body<br />problem and the reviews I saw online did not give<br />them the best rating.","Corinne O'Dell (10%): If you look at just the<br />numbers, there are 8 other shows nominated, which<br />puts it at a mathematical 12.5%. However, the<br />show has received many positive reviews. After<br />researching the category and looking at what the<br />experts are saying, the show Shōgun is the front<br />runner for the award, as it has been sweeping<br />everything else. That is why I have lowered my<br />prediction to 10%.","Edward Tsui (2.94%): The Vegas Insider betting<br />odds have \"3 Body Problem\" at +3300, which means<br />if I were to put a $100 bet on the show winning, I<br />would make my 100 back along with 3300. This high<br />payout, especially being a positive bet, means<br />the outcome is very unlikely. Using an implied<br />probability calculator, with ODDS/ (ODDS +100)<br />that equals 0.0294 or 2.94%. Using reviews online,<br />Shogun has the highest nominations and likelihood<br />to make it the winner. Furthermore, 3 Body Problem<br />is tied for dead last in ranking with The Gilded<br />Age out of list of 8 nominations for the Emmys.","Haley Ford (2%): Based on online discourse and<br />Gold Derby odds, Shogun is favored immensely.<br />Additionally, the odds in Gold Derby are<br />the lowest out of all the choices, and it is<br />more difficult for a new series to win this<br />award--although Shogun is new it seems to garner<br />much more support and was also nominated for many<br />categories across the board.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): Other shows have much<br />higher rotten tomatoes scores.","Brooke Mcdermott (10%): There are a lot of factors<br />pushing against their win. Primarily, there is<br />a much higher change that their competitor in<br />the category, Shogun, wins. It showed a lot of<br />success at the Creative Arts Emmys show, which<br />makes it kind of a shoe in to win on the 15th.<br />Additionally, the last few years, the Outstanding<br />Drama Series have typically gone to shows that<br />show interfamilial turmoil or issues within social<br />spheres, like Succession and Game of Thrones. I<br />think those who made the show have a really good<br />track record in writing and cinematography (in<br />terms of previous Emmy award and noms in said<br />categories) , but that was from their stints on<br />Game of Thrones.","Jessica Armour (30%): The show currently has six<br />different nominations for an Emmy, however there<br />are several other shows which currently have 19+<br />Emmy nominations.Therefore, I think it is unlikely<br />that the show \"Three Body Problem\" will receive an<br />Emmy when it has a significantly lower portion of<br />nominations compared to other shows streaming on<br />Netflix.","Simon Gersten (10%): Shogun is the frontrunner and<br />has been nominated for 25 Emmys, making it highly<br />unlikely that 3 body problem will surpass it.","Vikram Bharadwaj (5%): When it comes to the<br />Emmy awards, especially for Dramas, there is a<br />clear trend with the committee heavily avoiding<br />Sci-Fi shows in general. With 3 body problem not<br />being the most especially well received shows<br />as compared to shows such as 将軍(Shōgun) which<br />is by and far the most likely to win the award.<br />Especially when we start to consider just how many<br />strong shows there are this year, 3 body problem<br />is such a huge outlier in how poorly received<br />it was by a large part of its fandom. Truly 3<br />body problem winning this award would be an act<br />of god wanting my brier score to get absolutely<br />destroyed.","Kira Liscombe (5%): I made the forecast that on<br />a scale of 0 to 100, there is a probability of 5<br />that the show \"3 Body Problem\" will win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding Drama Series on Sep 15. To<br />determine this, I compared \"3 Body Problem\" to its<br />top competitor, analyzing media predictions, other<br />awards/accreditations received by the series, and<br />the previous Outstanding Drama Series winner. I<br />explained this further in depth in my brief.","Liv Payne (20%): \"3 Body Problem\" has stiff<br />competition this year at the Emmy's. For one, \"The<br />Crown\" is up for the same award, and that series<br />has already received 21 Emmy's since 2016. Then<br />there is \"Shōgun\", which has broken the record for<br />the most wins in a single season at 14 wins. Up<br />against these two alone, it seems unlikely that<br />\"3 Body Problem\" will win, so I put my probability<br />around 20%.","Reece Slater (4%): I haven't seen any of these<br />shows personally, but everyone online seems to<br />be talking about Shogun and The Crown as the<br />front-runners, and noting \"3 Body Problem\" as a<br />very random nomination. Also, Mr. and Mrs. Smith<br />is largely talked about from some sources. I have<br />yet to see a prediction that even mentions \"3 Body<br />Problem\" to win, so I'm going to gamble and say 4%<br />chance.","Erin Ho (15%): Full disclosure, I have not<br />watched any of the shows that have been listed<br />for this Emmy Award and I’ve only “loosely”<br />heard about some of them from people I know.<br />Looking at previous years Emmy Award winners<br />for this category, many of them had more than<br />20 nominations in other categories and some won<br />multiple Emmys on top of the Outstanding Drama<br />Series. While “3 Body Problem” might have 6 Emmy<br />nominations overall, it’s facing off against<br />other series in this category that have 18 or<br />more nominations such as “Shogun” and “The Morning<br />Show.”","Shayna Van Glish (30%): I think that is is<br />unlikely that 3 Body Problem will win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding Drama Series, as Shogun is<br />leading most predictions. However, it definitely<br />is a contender so there still is a chance it could<br />happen.","Alexis Frazer (25%): While there is a chance that<br />3 Body Problem will win the Emmy, its contenders<br />are more critically acclaimed and recieved more<br />nominations, which is a solid indicator that they<br />will receive more Emmys.","Colin Barry (0.5%): I think that \"3 Body Problem\"<br />has an incredibly low chance to win the award for<br />Most Outstanding Drama at around a 0.5% chance<br />to win. This is because the show is nominated<br />for very few awards, a characteristic that many<br />shows that due end up winning the award share. As<br />well as being nominated in the same wave as FX's<br />\"Shogun\", which is on pace to sweep the Emmys in a<br />fashion never before seen for a single season of a<br />tv show.","Ladi Fashogbon (40%): There are other shows like<br />shotgun that have a higher chance of winning. That<br />show has a higher rotten tomatoes and \"popcorn\"<br />rating.","Gracie Culpepper (27%): I think most likely this<br />won't happen. Usually the bigger awards like<br />these will go to really popular shows, so I would<br />be surprised if this show won for this category.<br />Also, most of the time the winners for the big<br />nominations are also nominated/win other big<br />categories, and I think the likelihood of this<br />show doing that is slim. I think it could happen,<br />just is pretty unlikely.","David Daniels (12%): I would like to preface<br />this forecast by stating that I don't watch<br />the Emmys and have no particular interest in<br />them. My response is based on insights from Emmy<br />enthusiasts and viewer reactions. According to<br />Diesel Labs, \"The Three-Body Problem\" has roughly<br />a 23% chance of occurring, while opinions seem to<br />be more skeptical regarding this show. Vegas has<br />odds for \"3 Body Problem\" at +1600, which roughly<br />equates to a 5.9% chance of happening. Although<br />I am unfamiliar with the show or the Emmys, most<br />predictions suggest that \"Shōgun\" is likely to win<br />this nomination. Given these factors, I estimate<br />the probability of \"The Three-Body Problem\"<br />winning to be around 12%.","Matthew Harvey (20%): The show 3 Body Problem,<br />is a Science Fiction drama show that has been<br />nominated 6 times for this weekend's Emmy<br />Awards. It is an incredible feat for any show<br />to be considered for an Emmy, let alone 6. While<br />this would drastically raise a show's chances<br />of being selected to win the award, Each of the<br />nominations the show has gotten, are also in<br />categories with more well known shows that have<br />grown in popularity with other creations such as<br />Shogun, a top consideration for winning most/if<br />not in all the same categories as the Three-body<br />problem. While predicting winners is the backbone<br />of this class, there are news networks that hire<br />individuals with greater experience than I do<br />currenlty to pick winners of Awards shows such as<br />the Emmy's. In each of the categories the 3 Body<br />Problem is in, in none of them do the predictors<br />have it winning against its competitors. However<br />stranger and unpredictability are two things<br />to consider in any competition. That is why I<br />have a higher percentage than 13% which is what<br />you get for each event nominee winning an emmy<br />in a specific category. It should also be noted<br />that emmy's are an awards show that does not<br />care that each and every show gets an award. If<br />a show should meet the criteria to win in all<br />categories, that is the show they will choose.<br />https://variety.com/lists/2024-emmys-predictions/drama-series-2/","Victor Avila (15%): The Emmy's are in 2 days<br />and the outstanding drama award is packed with<br />great contenders. I did not hear of \"3 body<br />problem\" until reading this question, and while<br />the category has great shows like Shogun and the<br />Crown. The main reason I said it only has a 15%<br />probability to win, it because I read that Sci-Fi<br />movies are much less likely to win this category<br />and its only in its first season.","Franco Bravo (15%): One of the main reasons I<br />gave this such a low probability of happening is<br />mainly because of the competition that it has in<br />the Drama series. With shows like Shogun which<br />has been receiving massive amounts of press and<br />positive spotlight","Alex Vrolijk (30%): A lot of the articles I have<br />been reading online expect Shogun to win the award<br />for Outstanding Drama. I know very little about<br />the Emmy's or these TV shows so I chose 30. It has<br />also happened before that the winner of one of the<br />awards was unexpected, so I do not want to put too<br />confident of a probability.","Findleigh Ague (10%): Basically every source that<br />I have looked at says that Shogun is going to<br />win, and a few saw that The Crown will. I tried<br />to look mostly at media magazines and publications<br />like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, and both<br />favor Shogun. It is also important to look at past<br />winners, but in more recent years, the winners<br />have been shows like The Crown and Succession,<br />which are pretty different from 3 Body Problem.<br />It is true that shows more similar to the sci-fi<br />genre like Game of Thrones have won this award<br />many times, but based on recent trends and<br />experts' opinions on the subject, I don't think<br />that it will win.","Abigail Harris (20%): Every winner of the<br />outstanding drama series Emmy has been a serial<br />runner since 2011. This doesn’t bode well for<br />the 3 body problem which comparatively has just<br />1 season out. There’s also the matter of their<br />six nominations compared to the overwhelming mass<br />from competitors like shogun, which is typically<br />a positive indicator. Also, most of their<br />nominations are for sound mixing or cinematic<br />design while shogun is being lauded for acting<br />and personnel, not a great sign for the three body<br />problem to win in an overall category.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (2%): I explain in the<br />briefing!!","Carson Ankeny (0%): Shogun is basically Game<br />of Thrones 2.0 - a darling of this category at<br />Emmys in previous years. Additionally, Shogun<br />is nominated at a huge clip across the board of<br />categories, and won several at the Creative Arts<br />Emmys earlier this month. Three Body Problem is<br />only nominated in 6 categories, which would be<br />a historically low amount of total noms for an<br />\"overall category\" winner like winning Outstanding<br />Drama Series. While shows with few noms can win in<br />certain categories like actor if they really stand<br />out, there is basically a zero percent chance that<br />the show will win best overall without racking up<br />noms in all the other categories."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will ByteDance announce<br />a deal to sell TikTok<br />before Dec 1?","Will the COVID-19 weekly<br />death rates in the United<br />States reach 3,000 or<br />above before Dec 1?","Will the show \"3 Body<br />Problem\" win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding<br />Drama Series on Sep 15?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will ByteDance announce<br />a deal to sell TikTok<br />before Dec 1?","Will the COVID-19 weekly<br />death rates in the United<br />States reach 3,000 or<br />above before Dec 1?","Will the show \"3 Body<br />Problem\" win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding<br />Drama Series on Sep 15?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"127064ca239b":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"127040152d5":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"127064ca239b","visdat":{"127064ca239b":["function (y) ","x"],"127040152d5":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Mike Johnson created such a bill but<br />shortly shot it down after failing to receive<br />support from his own party. Democrats on the<br />other hand are only willing to support a spending<br />bill on its own. This leads me to believe that<br />a shutdown is possible but with 2 weeks until<br />the deadline, there is still room for a spending<br />bill to be passed. The 2 most recent shutdowns<br />came about from similar disagreements. One party<br />tried to attach another bill to the funding bill,<br />leading to Congress failing to meet their funding<br />deadline.","Simon Gersten (70%): Given political deadlock and<br />disagreement over key spending issues, a shutdown<br />is likely even if only for a brief period of time.","Abby Crowe (55%): I predict a 55% chance of the<br />government shutting down before Dec 1st. I think<br />it is possible that another continuing resolution<br />could be drafted and passed to avoid shut down,<br />and I find it almost equally likely that it won’t<br />happen. Adding in the consideration of Trump’s<br />rhetoric towards a shut down, I find it slightly<br />more likely that it will occur.","Erin Ho (60%): There is a lot of opposition to<br />the current House bill from Democrats and even<br />a few Republicans, which includes a proof of<br />citizenship mandate for voter registration. This<br />is being heavily pushed by the House Speaker<br />and other Republicans, because they claim it’ll<br />ensure non-citizens won’t be able to vote in the<br />US Elections. However, there is push back because<br />it’s already against the law for non-citizens to<br />vote and congressmen fear that it will discourage<br />other Americans from registering if they lack<br />necessary paperwork. In the end, it really comes<br />down to if both parties are willing to work<br />together to compromise.","Jessica Armour (30%): Based on what I have read,<br />if a bill is not passed by Sept 30th then we<br />will lead into a government shut down. However,<br />not only is this going to significantly effect<br />the presidential election, but also so many<br />governmental agencies and considering it is at the<br />end of the year I find it a little hard to believe<br />that it will occur. I am going to say there's a<br />30% chance since this is an election year and that<br />would be so so so horrible to occur. I would also<br />think that the senate would be understanding and<br />make sure they pass a bill before the fiscal year<br />ends considering all of the other stressors this<br />year entails.","Liv Payne (60%): This question is rather tricky.<br />According to an article I read, a shutdown was<br />avoided when Congress approved the 6 remaining<br />bills for the federal budget. However, we are not<br />out of the woods just yet because the House and<br />Senate still have to negotiate a budget that will<br />pass Congress and the President by September 30th.<br />The issue is that, as part of the bill, Republican<br />leader in the House Johnson wants to include<br />a provision that would require people to prove<br />citizenship in order to vote. Not only this, but<br />the proposal would mean nudget cuts for divisions<br />such as education, veterans, the military, etc.<br />This proposal barely passed the House (209-206),<br />with some Republicans defecting and disagreeing<br />with the proposal. One described the proposal as<br />\"dead on arrival\" in the Senate, and Biden said he<br />would veto the proposal if it made it to his desk.<br />Unless Johnson can amend his proposal, it seems<br />like a shutdown is inevitable, and the man seems<br />determined to keep it in. Others, Democrats and<br />Republicans alike, have criticized Johnson for his<br />bullheadedness, but unless he can be convinced,<br />it appears a shut down will occur. I erred on the<br />side of caution, as I feel it is more likely than<br />not, but 70% feels too high and 50% feels too low.","Haley Ford (15%): As September 30th nears,<br />a shutdown seems more likely. However, after<br />hearing forecasts from NPR with Chuck Schumer<br />and based on predictions on FOX9, a shutdown<br />is not likely, and current disagreement<br />is likely has to do more with negotiation<br />tactics. https://www.fox9.com/video/1516770<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/government-shutdown-looms-congress-returns-just-three-weeks-avoid-rcna169620","Corinne O'Dell (35%): Although there is political<br />gridlock in the government right now, they will do<br />whatever it takes for there to not be a shutdown.<br />The next deadline in September 30, and I believe<br />that Congress will pass a version of a short term<br />spending bill. Congress has historically avoided<br />long-term shutdowns by passing short-term funding<br />bills, known as continuing resolutions, to keep<br />the government running. Senate leaders from both<br />parties have already been working on a bipartisan<br />stopgap solution to avoid disruption.","Kira Liscombe (3%): So far, only five of the<br />bills needed to complete the federal budget have<br />passed in the House and none have yet passed the<br />Senate. I saw some reports that the House Speaker<br />made a proposition for a funding extension until<br />March, but its voter registration add-on makes<br />it unlikely to receive Senate support. Since 1980<br />there have been only been 14 funding gaps in the<br />US federal government. Only four of these lasted<br />four or more business days and broadly impacted<br />government operations. It is very uncommon to<br />see an entire federal shut down, and congress is<br />expected to pass a CR by the end of September to<br />avoid a shutdown. They will most likely pass a<br />more short-term extension than proposed by the<br />speaker until the end of December.","Shayna Van Glish (63%): Given that the current<br />situation in the federal government is that they<br />had to enforce a CR, it is not looking good that<br />Congress will be able to agree by the time the<br />funding expires. With partisan disagreements and<br />internal divisions it makes it really hard to come<br />to a terms that people will agree on. Due to this,<br />I think that it is likely there is a shutdown,<br />however, it is not for sure so I am giving it a<br />likelihood of 63%.","Gracie Culpepper (45%): With the election coming<br />up, we don’t know who will be taking office.<br />It is also likely that Congress will not pass<br />the new budget by Sept 30 because of various<br />disagreements. I’m saying 45 because I think it is<br />only slightly less than halfway probable.","Victor Avila (60%): Congress has to pass<br />an appropriations bill to avoid government<br />shutdown by September 30th. As spending bills<br />originate in the currently-republican held House<br />of Representatives, included in the spending<br />bill are provisions enforcing voter ID law<br />regulations, which is a debate amongst republicans<br />and democrats. With the upcoming presidential<br />election, Donald Trump is pressuring republicans<br />to accept a shutdown to make the current<br />administration look bad. I do not think they<br />will receive the needed democrat votes for such a<br />partisan issue during election season.","Minha Ahmad (10%): It is highly unlikely the<br />government will shut down before Dec. 1. The last<br />government shut down was 5 years ago at the end of<br />December and beginning of January of 2018 and 2019<br />because Trump could not agree on an appropriations<br />bill to fund the government for the next fiscal<br />year. I think if the government were to shutdown<br />again, it would be at the end of the year if<br />Biden does not agree on a certain bill for 2025,<br />sometime in December, and not before December 1st.","Vikram Bharadwaj (57.5%): When looking at the<br />question of whether there will be a shut down,<br />we really have to look at the strength of Donald<br />Trump and his control over his own party. During<br />the past few weeks, we had significant cracks<br />within his strength, with notable opposing<br />republicans endorsing Kamala Harris instead of<br />him, yet the power at the end of the day lies in<br />a die-hard Trump supporter in Mike Johnson, and<br />without the Democrats signing on to extremely<br />strict voter identification laws, it is likely he<br />will push the Federal government into a shut-down.<br />However everything can change, just today we had<br />the Second Trump assassination attempt, throwing<br />the potential of him having a larger grip onto his<br />party due to this. With that in mind, and with the<br />insanity that is congress, I give it a 57 and a<br />half chance that the US gov't will shut down.","Jeffrey Markowitz (35%): Not too many signs that<br />the government will shut down, but the government<br />needs to negotiate deals to keep itself funded.","Hayden Morehouse (5%): This is something that<br />almost never happens while we saw a glimpse of<br />this in early 2024 I doubt anything like this will<br />take place in the next few months. I am going low<br />here in hopes to get a good score on this one.","David Daniels (10%): I believe the chances of a<br />U.S. government shutdown before December 1st are<br />quite low. While there have been 10 shutdowns<br />since 1981, most of them occurred before 2000.<br />Only three have happened in the last 29 years,<br />which makes me more skeptical of a shutdown now.<br />Shutdowns during election years are rare because<br />politicians don’t want to hurt their chances<br />at the polls. With elections coming up and the<br />likelihood of short-term funding solutions, I<br />estimate the chance of a shutdown before December<br />at around 10%, based on timing, political<br />strategy, and historical trends.","Colin Barry (40%): I think that a government<br />shutdown is a little less likely to occur than not<br />occur. This is because budget disagreements and<br />disputes in the congress are the main reason that<br />the government would go into a \"shutdown\", but<br />congress has gone into a special meeting recently<br />in order to prevent this from happening. These<br />same concerns almost lead to a shutdown earlier<br />in the year and were prevented and I see a similar<br />situation happening this time.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (40%): Random, but I<br />remember when the government last shutdown. I<br />found this question particularly difficult to<br />answer, as I was unfamiliar with their being talks<br />about Congress shutting down. If I researched<br />correctly, what is threatening the shutdown is<br />the SAVE Act. I don't think it is likely for<br />the government to shutdown because the 2024<br />Presidential Elections are coming up. If I am not<br />mistaken, the past government shutdowns did not<br />occur that close to election season. First I had<br />65% chance, but that fact brought it down. This<br />really depends on how strongly Congressmen feel<br />about the SAVE Act. If they strongly support it<br />and it is not included, will they vote against the<br />bill, even as we approach the elections?","Alex Vrolijk (40%): According to news articles,<br />congress does not seem close to passing a spending<br />bill. There is also contention between the two<br />parties on bills being pork barreled into the<br />spending bill like the SAVE Act, with Democrats<br />openly rejecting any spending bills it is included<br />in. Despite all the conflict and the winding<br />clock, I believe congress will be able to pass a<br />spending bill (or extension) near last minute that<br />will avoid any government shutdown through Dec.<br />1'st.","Leo Zegarra (22%): I’m giving about a 22% chance<br />the U.S. federal government could shut down before<br />December 1, 2024. This estimate takes into account<br />that shutdowns happen occasionally due to budget<br />disagreements and the added tension of an election<br />year. And while shutdowns are not very common, the<br />political heat of an election year can increase<br />the likelihood, though last-minute deals often<br />prevent them. I just think it’s unlikely because<br />lawmakers generally work hard to reach agreements<br />and avoid the disruptions a shutdown would cause.","Franco Bravo (35%): I am not too confident that<br />the US government will shut down, however in light<br />of recent news in relation to JD Vance and the<br />Republican Party push for voter id. However, it<br />being an election year and the election looming<br />around the corner, I believe that if there were to<br />be a government shut down, it would be blamed on<br />the republicans which would bring negative press<br />to the party before the election.","Reece Slater (40%): Speaker Johnson has said that<br />a shutdown is not an option. Also, I considered<br />that Donald Trump is encouraging the Republicans<br />to not agree to a deal unless certain conditions<br />are met. I think this could go either way, but I<br />am leaning towards it not happening.","Abigail Harris (20%): Pew has found that Americans<br />view government shutdowns as a negative thing and<br />that most of them think its a serious problem.<br />In addition to just causing anxiety, Pew has also<br />found that it makes the party in control of the<br />White House and congressional leadership overall<br />look terrible. Plummeting approval ratings are<br />not something any politician wants this close to<br />November in an election year. But after November,<br />what happens if Harris loses and the democrats<br />decide they're going to low ball the incoming<br />administration by leaving them a mess with the<br />next year's fiscal funding? That's really the<br />only big threat I see throwing a wrench in the<br />prediction seeing as how we didn't appropriate<br />this fiscal year until March, six months<br />into it, and have been consistently seeing to<br />appropriations later than it should, especially<br />since 2019 shutdowns under Trump.","Brooke Mcdermott (75%): There are a lot of talks<br />and seemingly no solutions to the potential<br />shutdown. Additionally, there are pressures from<br />both sides to stop the shutdown , though the<br />pressures from Republican nominees Trump and JD<br />Vance seem to be further complicating the issue.","Matthew Harvey (20%): I believe there is ample<br />enough time for congress to come to a consensus<br />surrounding the government shutdown and passing<br />the bill they are hoping to. GOP members, however,<br />are going to have to compromise and take a lot<br />of harsh voter intimidation laws out of this bill<br />so that it can pass and the government can avoid<br />a shutdown. The issue that democrats and some<br />republicans have with the stopgap bill that would<br />continue the funding of the government agencies<br />is that it has an attached voting rider which<br />requires photo identification in all staters. No<br />government official wants a government shutdown<br />as it paints a largely bad picture for any<br />legislator, however until there are compromises,<br />some republicans are trying to pass legislation<br />that would also postpone the shutdown until after<br />the original deadline.","John Mathis (70%): While this may seem high, I<br />simply do not see a world in which funding is<br />passed. 1. The Election will be a month a way<br />when the government is set to shut down, and<br />republicans in the house would have a vested<br />interest in a shutdown occurring to make Dems look<br />bad at a pivotal moment 2. Freedom caucus members<br />have said that the current plan is far too much<br />money, and they have been the holdouts in past.<br />The only saving grace is the SAVE act, which would<br />require all voters to provide proof of citizenship<br />when voting and would go into place THIS ELECTION<br />CYCLE (insane voter suppression attempt by the<br />way, it’s already illegal for non-citizens to vote<br />and there’s no evidence that undocumenteds vote on<br />a meaningful scale). Trump has fully said that he<br />would encourage people to let the government shut<br />down if the act is not included, and his sway is<br />immense 3. If the SAVE act is included, Biden said<br />he would veto the bill, which I believe because<br />of the huge administrative and political cost it<br />would have so close to an election. So, we have a<br />3 way draw between moderate republicans, freedom<br />caucus, and Dems. I find it quite unlikely that<br />they could agree within those 3 weeks.","Rommy Etzion (38%): Throughout all American<br />History, funding gaps have been more frequent,<br />with 3/4 true government shut downs happening in<br />the past 10 years.","Edward Tsui (75%): The government does not value<br />passing a balanced budget. House Speaker Johnson<br />has removed the SAVE act as of 5 days ago, and<br />negotiations need to happen by Sept 30th when<br />the current CRS expires. Otherwise, the shutdown<br />will happen before the 1st of December. GOP is<br />advocating for shutdown whether from JD Vance or<br />Trump, and neither side wants to negotiate given<br />the timing of the election and the voter proof<br />clause stated in the original SAVE act.","Findleigh Ague (40%): I think that it would be<br />very unwise for Congress to allow a shutdown<br />right before the election. States rely on the<br />appropriations from the government for the<br />elections, so it could allow for insufficient<br />resources and interference with the election. I<br />think that if they don’t agree on a new CR, they<br />at least won’t let the government shutdown long<br />enough for federal employees to be furloughed.","Alexis Frazer (25%): Government shut downs are<br />commonly used by democrats and republicans in<br />order to negotiate their side of the bargain. In<br />most cases, they end up getting the legislation<br />signed. Also, with the election there is too much<br />on the line for the congressman. Republicans would<br />take the bad PR of shutting down the government<br />(no welfare payments, no social security payments)<br />and it could potentially harm them during the<br />election.","William Willis (40%): The government shut down<br />looks like it will be based on Congress passing<br />a budget or continuing resolution. Political<br />disagreements, particularly over spending<br />priorities, could lead to a shutdown. I highly<br />doubt that it will happen. But with the way the<br />government has trouble working things out. It<br />could become more likely. It runs out on September<br />30. Will be investing to see what will happen.","Carson Ankeny (60%): House GOP are threatening to<br />shut down the government unless they get certain<br />concessions in the spending bill. I don’t think<br />they’re going to be able to negotiate those in.<br />I don’t foresee a very long shut down but I could<br />see Speaker Johnson inviting a short one just to<br />make his point.","Ladi Fashogbon (30%): Mainly the current<br />president, President Biden is finalizing plans to<br />endorse major changes to the Supreme Court in the<br />coming weeks.","Erin Ho (38%): I haven’t heard any updates since<br />Biden made the announcement in July 2024, so I’m<br />not sure what’s the current state of the reform.<br />It’s a bold decision to make, and allegedly it’s<br />supported by a lot of the registered voters in the<br />US, but there’s other fish to fry with the House<br />and Senate not trying to shut down the government<br />and the Presidential Election in November. I<br />think, depending on how the election turns out and<br />the next funding bill, there could be movement on<br />it.","Abby Crowe (5%): I predict a 5% chance that<br />supreme court reform will be signed into law<br />before December 1st. I find this highly unlikely,<br />due to the current lack of momentum for the<br />issue with all the election buzz. Biden made a<br />big statement back over the summer, but this is<br />not an issue Harris has been leaning in on, so<br />even if she wins the presidency and has influence<br />post-election, I still don’t believe reform is<br />coming any time soon.","Ryan Foley (10%): Supreme Court reform is a<br />largely partisan debate, with primarily democrats<br />pushing the issue. We see in today's court how<br />their decisions have not aligned with much of the<br />American public's views, especially in regards<br />to abortion and presidential immunity. For reform<br />to be passed it would require a constitutional<br />amendment or new legislation. I highly doubt that<br />a new amendment would be able to be passed, as<br />2/3 of the states would not agree to term limits.<br />The other option is new legislation. First, a law<br />would need to get past both the House and Senate.<br />Currently, Republicans hold the House and the<br />Democrats hold a slight majority in the Senate.<br />If people voted strictly on party lines new reform<br />legislation would not pass. On the chance it does<br />however, the Supreme Court could strike down that<br />legislation through judicial review. This leaves<br />a very low chance of reform being passed with both<br />methods being easily blocked.","Minha Ahmad (40%): In July, President Biden<br />proposed several reforms. However, these are more<br />long-shot moves since his reforms would require<br />congressional approval and do not seem likely<br />to be passed by December 1st. In 2021, Biden<br />created a commission to study structural changes<br />in the Supreme Court, which has not been passed<br />to this day. In terms of reform being pushed by<br />the Court or past decisions being overturned, the<br />Supreme Court Justices are a Republican majority,<br />and do not seem very likely to push for reforms,<br />especially those being requested by the public,<br />like reinstating Roe v. Wade. However, at the same<br />time, you never know what may happen, which is why<br />my guess is less than 50% but not extremely low.","Brooke Mcdermott (5%): This is pretty unlikely<br />to happen until at least after the election,<br />and after that, most of the bills that have<br />been proposed haven't even made it to committee.<br />Additionally, there's mixed support on the<br />reforms, and I think there's going to be a lot<br />of back and forth on reforms and what that needs<br />to look like going forward. I feel that we could<br />see term limits in the future, but definitely not<br />before Dec 1.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): While this is something<br />that Biden has talked about doing in the past<br />I do not see this happening in the time frame<br />given. There are alot of hoops to jump through to<br />get this done and I am thinking the left is more<br />concerned with the campaign trail currently than<br />getting this done.","Jessica Armour (15%): Considering the election and<br />the turmoil a Supreme Court reform would cause, I<br />think it is highly unlikely that a reform would be<br />signed into law at least not by Dec 1. With that<br />being said, the majority of news posts that have<br />been made about this seems to have been created<br />earlier in the year. Along with this, a reform of<br />the Supreme Court would definitely cause problems<br />between the three branches as well as between the<br />Democratic and Republican parties.","Simon Gersten (0%): This will not happen. Neither<br />party is seriously considering the idea, there is<br />no broad, outspoken support for this issue and no<br />real bill has undergone any processes to make this<br />reasonable in the timeframe.","Shayna Van Glish (5%): I think that it is really<br />unlikely that the Supreme Court reform will be<br />signed into law before Dec 1. Specifically, due to<br />the timeline it would take to pass this not being<br />able to be executed in the upcoming deadline.<br />Also, it would require both House and Senate<br />approval and with the Republicans controlling the<br />House it seems highly unlikely.","Gracie Culpepper (10%): I think this proposal<br />reads really well and would be beneficial for our<br />judicial branch, however, I don't think that this<br />is going to pass right now. Especially with the<br />election coming up, I really don't think this is<br />going to be Congress's primary focus.","Liv Payne (20%): Looking online, there doesn't<br />seem to be much talk about Biden's reform in<br />recent weeks. Most of the articles I found are<br />from a month ago or earlier, making me think<br />that discussions have died down around it. Biden<br />has proposed 3 reforms, one of which directly<br />affects the Supreme Court, of which 6 are<br />Repbulican-appointed. Even if the reform made it<br />all the way to the SCOTUS, it seems unlikely that<br />it would pass. And if it did, I don't believe it<br />will happen before December.","Kira Liscombe (1%): I think its very unrealistic<br />that a bill establishing 18-year terms for Supreme<br />Court Justices and requiring the President to<br />appoint a Supreme Court Justice every two years<br />will not pass at a time like this so close to<br />the election. I found information that Democrats<br />and Republicans are farther apart ideologically<br />than they’ve been in the last 50 years, according<br />to an analysis by the nonpartisan Pew Research<br />Center. This means its very difficult for the<br />bipartisanship necessary to push legislation<br />through congress. Even though most Americans<br />support ending life tenure, there is little<br />history of court reform in America. I also saw<br />alot of negative news about it, especially Bidens<br />recent hypocritical comments on Mexico's court<br />reform. The issue is too polarizing right now to<br />pass, at least not in the next three months.","Corinne O'Dell (5%): Supreme Court reform is<br />unlikely to be signed into law by December 1,<br />2024, due to significant political opposition<br />from Republican lawmakers. Proposals such as<br />term limits and a binding ethics code face strong<br />resistance, and passing such reforms would require<br />bipartisan support, which is currently lacking.<br />Additionally, more substantial reforms, like<br />term limits, would necessitate a constitutional<br />amendment—a long and complex process. The divided<br />political landscape makes it improbable that these<br />changes will move forward quickly​.","David Daniels (2%): In order for reform like this<br />to pass it would require either a Constitutional<br />Convention (IE the states call for a vote, 2/3<br />required to pass) or both chambers of legislation<br />need to pass a Constitutional Amendment (which<br />also required a 2/3 majority) to pass. The last<br />Constitutional Amendment was in 1992, and for<br />good reason, partisan bills don't often get a<br />2/3 majority. In addition to needing to pass the<br />senate, this bill would also need to pass the<br />house, where the majority leader Mike Johnson<br />has stated that the president's plan is \"dead on<br />arrival in the House.\" The likelihood of this bill<br />passing is \"highly unlikely\" as described by left<br />leaning media such as CBS (democrats being the<br />ones trying to push this reform). This reasoning<br />has landed me on a probability of 2%.","William Willis (10%): I gave this question an<br />10% probability of occurring, The reason that I<br />said this number was because on the constitution<br />website it said the debate over Supreme Court<br />term limits and the ways to implement them are<br />unlikely to fade from the court of public opinion.<br />This will be very hard thing to decide. I really<br />think that this is taking a jab at Trump and if<br />this will require a lot of time to review. The<br />most recent article I could find on it was July<br />31, which means that there has not been much media<br />discussion about it.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): With the election<br />upcoming, there is little chance of the law being<br />signed into law. After November 5th, there would<br />be a very small amount of time for the proposed<br />reforms to become a law.","Vikram Bharadwaj (10%): I find it incredibly<br />unlikely that Supreme court reform will even see<br />the light of day on the floor, let alone pass<br />through both Senate and the House and be signed<br />into law. The fact of the matter is, supreme court<br />reform would directly harm a more conservative<br />court in Robert's court, and it is extremely<br />unlikely that any republican in their right mind<br />would even support this bill, let alone vote for<br />it. Even across the aisle, many democrats feel as<br />though this is a politically charged proposition<br />and are thus heavily opposed to it. As such I am<br />giving it a 10% chance of occurring.","Victor Avila (10%): With the current Supreme Court<br />reaching its lowest approval rating in history,<br />at 38% according to a Fox News poll, major powers<br />are pushing the idea of Supreme Court reform.<br />President Biden and Vice President Harris have<br />both come out in support of reform with common<br />interest in term limits, but I do not think it<br />is likely that Supreme Court reform is likely to<br />happen. Optimists forget this needs congress’s<br />approval and it seems that republicans won’t give<br />up the power they have in the court.","Leo Zegarra (10%): Due to the lack of urgency, the<br />slow legislative process, and really mainly the<br />fact that there's split partisanship I give the<br />probability a 10%. Even if there were bipartisan<br />support, the legislative process is slow and<br />complex, requiring months or even years to pass<br />significant changes. With other priorities like<br />the economy and budget taking precedence, it's<br />highly unlikely that Supreme Court reform will<br />happen before December.","Abigail Harris (20%): Biden mentioned these<br />reforms (no POTUS immunity, term limits, and a<br />binding code of conduct) a lot more around the<br />time Trump's legal escapades were more present<br />in major media outlet coverage this year. Term<br />limits might mean constitutional amendments which<br />are a lengthy process on their own and just a<br />few states can cause major stalls like with the<br />ERA which ultimately failed. That would require<br />congress and state legislatures to stand behind<br />the POTUS before a potential Trump presidency or<br />when his own party sees him as a sitting duck,<br />warming the office for his own VP. I think the<br />larger disapproval ratings around SCOTUS due to<br />misconduct of the financial and sexual varieties<br />are important factors in mounting social change<br />but ultimately won't be reflected so quickly in<br />the legal world. The political world is gridlocked<br />and highly polarized, and these reforms would<br />require popular support in an election year from<br />all sides, something that just isn't likely to<br />happen before December.","Edward Tsui (5%): The general election is<br />too close by, and this is a partisan inspired<br />legislation idea that will not pass a simple<br />majority vote in the Republican controlled House.<br />Assuming negotiations work between the House<br />and Senate, the issue is polarizing enough that<br />a 2/3 vote override is not possible in both<br />chambers if Trump were elected come November.<br />His power wouldn't even start anyways until<br />January. However, the only way this bill passes<br />if Kamala wins and the House flips, which makes me<br />think that the likelihood would only be possible<br />post-election, after the inauguration, and not<br />by Dec 1st. Most proposed bills die in Congress,<br />especially politically divisive ones; the current<br />Supreme Court ideology lean benefits Republican<br />ideals and is bragged about by President<br />Trump. The numbers in favor of reform are like<br />multiplying pennies together with limited time,<br />motivation, and compromise.","Rommy Etzion (8%): The term limit for justices and<br />the immunity aspect would require a Constitutional<br />Amendment. To get an Amendment, given the<br />construction of the current House and Senate<br />would require significant bipartisan cooperation,<br />requiring a ⅔ vote in both the House and the<br />Senate. A Constitutional Convention is untested<br />and uncertain, and in my opinion unlikely to<br />happen before December 1. Ratification is an even<br />more difficult process, and I do not believe we<br />would even make it to that stage. Historically,<br />of about the 11,000 amendments proposed to<br />Congress, only 27 have been successfully ratified.<br />Many amendments have taken years and decades<br />to be ratified. With extreme polarization and<br />partisan divisions in the states and Congress,<br />as well as resistance to change, it is incredibly<br />unlikely. It being an election year, and currently<br />mid-September, that division is heightened.<br />Members of Trumps party would be extremely<br />reluctant to agree to this proposal, especially<br />with the timing.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (20%): Finding current<br />news for this was so difficult. After Biden<br />announced it, I remember everyone talked about<br />it, and then its popularity fizzled out. There<br />are three reforms listed on Biden's proposal.<br />In 2021, the reform was unlikely because Senate<br />had a Republican majority which is not the case<br />today. However, the House of Representatives today<br />has a Republican majority, making it difficult<br />to pass. I find the \"binding code of conduct\"<br />to be more feasible than the other two proposed<br />reforms, as it could possibly have bipartisan<br />support. All things considered, I think the reform<br />is very unlikely. First, I do not believe this<br />is Congress' #1 priority. As we learned in last<br />class, they have to figure out the budget bill,<br />and that is more important than Supreme Court<br />reform. Biden is also in his lame-duck period. I<br />do not know how effective Congress is right after<br />elections. If the Democrats sweep the elections<br />and gain control of the House, keep control of the<br />Senate, and win presidency, then I can see a form<br />of reform being likely.","Alexis Frazer (5%): The enforcement of term<br />limits on the Supreme Court will not be passed<br />in the foreseeable future given the makeup of<br />the court and congress. Roberts is against the<br />code of conduct, but it is still voluntary and<br />somewhat weak. I put a 5% probability because the<br />likelihood of this legislation being signed that<br />quickly is very slim.","John Mathis (1%): Given the Republican majority<br />in the house who will not support Supreme Court<br />reform due to Republican control of the court<br />right now, as well as an incredibly slim majority<br />in the senate, it is unlikely that any meaningful<br />legislation, especially one with term limits,<br />could be signed into law.","Haley Ford (10%): A code of ethics seems more<br />likely than justice election reforms. Much of<br />the public, on both sides, has felt that Supreme<br />Court reform in one way or another is needed.<br />However, with the highly partisan house and<br />senate changes could take longer than by December<br />1st. Additionally, some perspectives think such<br />a proposal in July is a campaign strategy and<br />would likely not take its course until the new<br />presidency.","Alex Vrolijk (1%): I think it is highly unlikely<br />that any Supreme court reform gets signed into law<br />by Dec. 1. Biden announced his plans for supreme<br />court reform after he dropped out of the 2024<br />election race so I believe it may be an empty<br />political promise. This is because I believe<br />any supreme court reform bill/proposals will<br />face a very long line of political scrutiny and<br />feasibility meaning it will take a lot longer than<br />2.5 months let alone the rest of Biden's term.","Matthew Harvey (0%): This is reform that<br />definitely needs to occur and while I believe<br />most individuals think the supreme court is a<br />branch that needs checking, it is almost next<br />to impossible to have any kind of reform while<br />working with a partisan congress. Getting any<br />kind of legislation passed that would reform<br />foundations laid out in the constitution is<br />almost next to unheard of during this time due<br />to a highly polarized society. in order for any<br />reform to be passed, it would have to get through<br />the House and the Senate with a high majority in<br />both, which no party has control of currently.<br />The other option would be for the appointments<br />of new judges to the supreme court (due to the<br />understanding that there is no limit to the amount<br />of supreme court justices allowed), however this<br />is seen as court packing and Biden who believes<br />in the traditional sense of the system wouldn't<br />attempt to do this in the case that a successor of<br />his might try the same thing in order to keep the<br />majority in their favor. This would also require<br />a rigorous process that takes a while to get done.<br />This, I believe, is more a project for someone<br />starting out their presidency or those running<br />for a second term and have that be what they work<br />on. All in all, the process of vetting a candidate<br />takes a while (something that cannot occur by the<br />December deadline). It also must be considered<br />of other issues or things that could arise that<br />might require him putting this on the backburner.<br />I wouldn't be surprised if he announced this<br />reform in order to garner support and turn this<br />over to a Democrat successor should he/she win.<br />https://sites.google.com/site/thepoliticsteacherorg/what-are-the-chances-of-reforming-the-supreme-court","Reece Slater (12%): I don't think it will happen.<br />I don't think anything will actually be put into<br />place, I just think it's a solid talking point<br />for politicians. Also, leading up to the election,<br />I don't think Biden wants to do anything crazy.<br />While it is true that he has nothing to lose since<br />he's not running for reelection, I don't think<br />anything will be put into place.","Findleigh Ague (15%): I doubt that the reform<br />that Biden wants like term limits and enforceable<br />ethics codes and even amending the constitution to<br />prevent presidential immunity will even be able to<br />pass the Republican-majority House. I think that<br />he won't have trouble getting Democratic support,<br />but it doesn't seem likely to happen in only a few<br />months.","Franco Bravo (25%): I believe that court reforms<br />will not be signed into law before December first<br />for several reasons. One of the main reasons<br />being is that this bill will and has faced severe<br />backlash and resistance from the republican party.<br />Some sources I have seen have labeled it \"Dead on<br />Arrival\" so it seems very unlikely that this would<br />get signed by December First","Carson Ankeny (5%): I think it is highly unlikely<br />that any of President Biden’s proposed reforms<br />pass through Congress prior to Election Day,<br />and I think it’s even less likely that lame<br />ducks would waste political capital voting on<br />it in late November.

The first Inside Out film came<br />out in 2015, very close to when Moana came out,<br />and made $90,440,272. Moana 2 only needs to make<br />(less than) half as much as Disney's top film<br />of the year to beat it's original film opening<br />weekend. On top of this, Moana 2 will release<br />over Thanksgiving weekend, which is normally a<br />very popular time for going to the movies. On<br />the contrary, numbers for Disney movies have been<br />dropping with last year's Wish only receiving<br />$19,698,228 over a thanksgiving opening. I still<br />predict there is a high chance Moana 2 will surpas<br />its original film in the box office, especially<br />since the Moana 2 trailer is the most watched<br />disney animated trailer in 24 hours at 178m views<br />and Moana was the most streamed movie of 2023 in<br />the United States across all platforms.","Erin Ho (68%): The first Moana movie earned $56.6<br />Million during its opening weekend in 2016, which<br />happened to be during Thanksgiving. It is one<br />of their highest grossest films for Thanksgiving<br />Weekend, right below Frozen as the highest.<br />Moana 2 will also open during Thanksgiving<br />weekend, which allows more people to see it since<br />they’ll be free. Currently, most of Disney’s<br />highest-grossing films are sequels and remakes of<br />their originals, with notable titles like Inside<br />Out 2, Frozen 2, Incredibles 2, and the Toy Story<br />sequels surpassing their originals.","Ryan Foley (80%): With the hype around Moana 2<br />it seems fairly certain that it will surpass the<br />original in its opening weekend. Moana 1 was one<br />of many people favorite Disney movies to come out<br />in the past few years, and pulled in about $60<br />million in its opening weekend. I feel like it<br />will have the same effect Inside Out 2 had, with<br />many of its original viewers having now grown<br />up and have a connection with the film that will<br />bring them back to watch the sequel. Inside Out 2<br />nearly doubled its original's box office. Frozen<br />2 did the exact same thing, more than doubling its<br />original's opening weekend. Due to this, I feel it<br />is safe to say Moana 2 will follow suit.","William Willis (20%): I feel that it is highly<br />likely for Moana 2 to beat the original Moana<br />during the opening weekend when it comes to<br />earning from the box office. During 2016 movie<br />theaters were a lot more popular than streaming<br />services. Now since covid everyone has streaming<br />services and people go to the movie theaters a<br />lot less. With that being said I think that a lot<br />of people will wait for it to appear on streaming<br />services and watch from the comfort from their own<br />home.","Brooke Mcdermott (99%): Various older Disney<br />animated film sequels surpass the opening<br />box office weekend of the original movie.<br />Additionally, Moana 2 was the most streamed movie<br />of 2023. CNBC predicts that the sequel will join<br />\"Disney's billionaire club\" alongside Inside Out<br />2.","Colin Barry (95%): The first Moana made roughly<br />$248 million at the domestic box office during<br />its original theatrical run in 2016. I think that<br />there is good reason to believe that the sequel<br />will top this performance when it releases later<br />this year. The first piece of evidence is that<br />Disney animated sequels do tend to outperform<br />their predecessor, looking at the recent success<br />of Inside Out 2 as an example. Another is that<br />with 187 million views in 24 hours, the trailer<br />for the sequel became the most viewed in that time<br />span in Disney's history. This is why I think it<br />is very likely that the sequel will outperform the<br />first in the U.S.","Findleigh Ague (90%): Out of the top 10 highest<br />opening weekends in the U.S. of all movies, 6<br />are sequels. Out of the top 10 highest opening<br />weekends in the U.S. of just Pixar movies, 6<br />of them are also sequels. 3 of those have been<br />released after the first Moana. There are 6 Pixar<br />movies with sequels (Toy Story and Cars have<br />multiple), and all 6 of those movies' sequels did<br />better in the box office on their opening weekend<br />than their first movie. After writing all of<br />that, I realized that Moana is not a Pixar movie<br />but it's a Walt Disney Animation Studio movie.<br />I'm still going to keep what I wrote because it<br />still supports my point. If it were Pixar, I would<br />give it a 100% probability. Walt Disney Animation<br />Studios's films don't surpass historic box office<br />points like Pixar's do. Frozen II and Ralph Breaks<br />the Internet are some Disney Animation films that<br />have done so, and I think that they are in the<br />same market as the viewers of Moana. Moana first<br />premiered in 2016, and the sequel comes out this<br />year (8 year gap). Frozen came out in 2013, and<br />its sequel came out in 2019 (6 year gap). Also,<br />both movies include girl main characters, both<br />are musicals, and both have some sort of magic<br />involved in their storyline too. I mention this<br />because these movies are inherently very similar,<br />and if Frozen II could surpass its original with<br />a big gap in between the two, then Moana could too<br />with a slightly longer gap.","Jessica Armour (95%): Based on an article from<br />business insider Disney sequels within the past<br />two decades have ALWAYS (or almost always) made<br />more than the original. They even say that if a<br />sequel doesn't make more than the original in box<br />office sales that the whole series is basically a<br />failure. Along with that, Frozen 2, the lion king<br />2, so many sequels of other Disney movies have<br />made soooooo much more than the original. Moana<br />itself was such an incredible movie and I know it<br />was so popular with the younger generations so I<br />think its a very safe bet to assume it will earn<br />more!","David Daniels (86%): After Disney's great success<br />with 'Inside Out 2\" I would say that it is<br />possible Disney animated will be able to get a<br />Billion dollar box office out of the new Moana<br />2. From what I have seen, the market seems to be<br />in agreeance that this will be a great revenue<br />stream for Disney. An interesting thing I saw<br />was the correlation between trailer views (across<br />all notable platforms) and initial popularity<br />in theater. In the first 24 hours of the trailer<br />being announced it accumulated nearly 200 million<br />views across major platforms, which is more<br />than Infinity War (2017). Movie critiques are in<br />agreement that this film will be more popular than<br />Moana, which consistently sits in the top streamed<br />movies on Disney + year after year. I'd say that<br />this is a strong bet that Moana 2 will earn more<br />in the opening weak, hence why I assign a 86%<br />probability.","Liv Payne (80%): In 2016, Moana was released<br />on November 23. With a budget of $150mil, it<br />made $82mil in its opening weekend. Moana 2 is<br />slated to occur over a 3 day weekend on Nov 23,<br />which could be cause for a higher turnout. With<br />this new wave of modern disney princesses, it<br />is actually quite hard to tell how well Moana 2<br />will do. Our only real comparison is with Frozen,<br />which was released Nov 27 2013. With a budget of<br />$150mil, it only made $243 thousand in its opening<br />weekend. However, its sequal did significantly<br />better. Still with a budget of $150, Frozen 2 made<br />$228.2 mil in its opening weekend, which - if I<br />did my math right - is almost a 9400% increase.<br />Unfortunately, there is little data for Moana 2<br />available at the moment. Searching for its budget<br />only reveals that it went up by $75mil earlier in<br />the year. If we go on the assumption that Disney<br />has found a sweet spot with $150mil, then perhaps<br />that means the new budget is $225 mil. A similar<br />film could be Inside Out, which had a budget of<br />$175mil and made $90.4mil in its opening weekend.<br />Inside Out 2, with a higher budget of $200 mil,<br />made $155 mil in its opening weekend. Granted,<br />throwing money at something doesn't mean its<br />going to do better. Disney has a history of making<br />sequals that pale in comparison to the original<br />(The Little Mermaid, Cindarella, The Hunchback<br />of Notre Dame, etc), but it seems like we have<br />entered a new era of sequals with actually good<br />storylines. Overall, even with limited data, it<br />seems like Moana 2 is going to follow the current<br />trend Disney has going for sequals. They are<br />certainly doing better than their newer original<br />stories (*cough* Wish *cough* didn't even make $20<br />mil in its opening weekend with a budget of $200<br />mil *cough* *cough*).","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (95%): Walt Disney<br />Studios has actually only ever released one<br />sequel in movie theatres. That movie was Frozen<br />2. Frozen 2 generated more money than Frozen 1 in<br />its opening weekend, making it one of the highest<br />grossing animated films of all time. Now, if we<br />include Pixar Studios, the number of sequels (I'm<br />counting the first sequel) increases to 6. These<br />movies include: Toy Story 2, Cars 2, Incredibles<br />2, Inside Out 2, Monsters University, and Finding<br />Dory. All of these sequels, for the exception<br />of Toy Story 2, earned more at the box office<br />in their opening weekend. Toy Story 2 apparently<br />was initially released in only one movie theatre,<br />so that explains its low opening weekend box<br />office. However, overall in the domestic box<br />office it earned more than the first movie of Toy<br />Story. According to ScreenRant, Moana was one of<br />the most watched movies in 2023. Additionally,<br />this movie is coming out during on the week of<br />Thanksgiving. It is the only movie coming out<br />that week, so there is less competition in the<br />market. The only other two PG rated films that<br />will be relatively new in theaters include Wicked<br />and Spellbound. These will be released the week<br />prior. Interestingly enough, Wicked was scheduled<br />to be released on November 27, but this month they<br />moved its release date to November 22, fearing<br />that Moana 2 would over take them in the opening<br />weekend. Based on this evidence, I feel strongly<br />about Moana 2 earning more than Moana 1.","Vikram Bharadwaj (95%): Not only did Moana 2<br />break Disney's record for most streamed trailer<br />in a 3 day period, it is predicted to be one of<br />the biggest movies of the year. With this giant<br />coming right off the heels of not only a notable<br />IP, but also a massive hit in Inside Out 2, there<br />is an amazing chance that it will blow the 56<br />million dollar opening weekend out of the water.<br />On top of this, Disney sequels that hit the<br />screen have always outperforms their original by<br />a good margin. On top of that the actual projected<br />figure sits at around 80 million, which many<br />critics claim to be on the conservative end. Not<br />to mention the slot has it in a prime position to<br />completely level the playing field as there are<br />truly no other good animated movies coming out<br />thanksgiving, likely due to the fact that MOANA<br />TWO is coming out.","Jeffrey Markowitz (70%): Frozen 2 made way more<br />than frozen 1 opening weekend. Moana 2 looks like<br />its set to make a big debut.","Gracie Culpepper (70%): I'm going to say this is<br />pretty likely because Moana is one of the most<br />streamed movies in the world, and also projections<br />show this movie doing really well in its first<br />week. It's also currently the most watched<br />animated Disney trailer within its first 24 hours<br />of release. I think this has a high likelihood of<br />earning more the second time around!","Reece Slater (85%): I looked at many previous<br />animated Disney films with sequels and every<br />single one of the sequels beat the original film<br />in box office sales in the opening weekend. Frozen<br />2, Inside Out 2, etc.","Leo Zegarra (77%): I believe that there's a<br />pretty high chance that Moana 2 will earn more<br />in its opening weekend than the original Moana<br />because of the growing popularity of the original<br />film and also due to the usual trend of Disney<br />sequels performing great and even better than the<br />original in the box office. Sequels from Disney<br />often perform well at the box office due to brand<br />trust and family appeal, and this was shown with<br />the Frozen collection. Additionally, Moana 2 is<br />poised to attract large crowds since the Disney+<br />subscription has given access to films that the<br />newer generation of kids may not have seen in<br />theaters. Finally, the fact that the movie will<br />release on Thanksgiving weekend helps with its<br />performance in the box office since families<br />are more inclined to go to the movies on holiday<br />weekends.","Edward Tsui (75%): According to business insider,<br />sequels are more popular now than ever before.<br />The trailer for this movie broke every record for<br />Disney, and the trading odds are 63% for Moana 2<br />to out gross Moana overall. I am leaning towards<br />the fact that the trailer and movie may be first<br />billion dollar movie for Disney since Frozen II,<br />and I think this movie has a loyal fan base based<br />on the quality of the first movie.","Shayna Van Glish (77%): I think that Moana 2 has a<br />77% probability of earning more than the original<br />film due to the anticipation of fan nostalgia.<br />Moana 2 has an advantage in attracting new fans<br />while also having its original fans. If Moana 2<br />receives positive feedback, there is a good chance<br />it will exceed the opening weekend box office than<br />the original.","Alex Vrolijk (85%): This is because Moana is very<br />popular and I believe there to be a bigger Moana<br />fan base hoping to watch Moana 2 opening weekend<br />now compared to the Moana movies release weekend.<br />Frozen 2's opening weekend box office sales were<br />almost double that of Frozen and I expect to see<br />something along the lines of that for Moana 2 as<br />well.","Victor Avila (90%): I believe Moana 2 will do<br />better opening weekend at the US box office,<br />compared to Moana 1, making 56.6 million USD.<br />The reasoning is because not only did Moana 2’s<br />trailer broke Disney’s record with 178 million<br />views in 24 hours, but also the audience will be<br />a lot more familiar with Moana now, and would go<br />see it on opening weekend. Also sequels tend to do<br />better regarding opening weekend attendance.","Alexis Frazer (85%): The original Moana was the<br />most streamed movie of 2023, there is a pattern<br />of sequels outperforming their predecessor opening<br />weekend as seen by Frozen and Toy Story, the 8<br />year gap between the two movies allowed for Moana<br />to grow its fan base.","Corinne O'Dell (75%): Moana 2 became the most<br />watched Disney trailer with 178M views in 24<br />hours. Disney has also not had a 1 billion dollar<br />animated movie in 5 years, which makes me think<br />they are pushing very hard for this to happen.<br />People are also returning to the movies after<br />COVID, so I believe Moana 2 has a good chance at<br />breaking the record.","Abigail Harris (90%): Sequels on average often<br />perform better than their original counterparts.<br />This is because of marketing and established fan<br />base, and how well the original was received.<br />With a movie like Moana it’s not a gamble to say<br />Disneys marketing is sufficient with the most<br />watched trailer in Disney animation history which<br />is INSANE. They beat inside out 2 for trailer<br />views already and that’s disneys 4th highest<br />grossing film of all time. It’s a pretty done<br />deal, my only hold up is if it happens that<br />weekend.","Franco Bravo (55%): I am relatively unsure about<br />this question as I have heard compelling evidence<br />for both arguments. However there seems to be<br />strong buzz around the movie and with an increased<br />budget there seems to be a better chance than it<br />not","John Mathis (40%): Sequels rarely make more than<br />the original film, simply because you have less of<br />a market because your audience is mostly reliant<br />on people who have seen the first movie. However,<br />I moderate closer to fifty just because Disney<br />is a powerhouse in the industry, and actually has<br />multiple sequels with higher opening weekends than<br />the original.","Matthew Harvey (85%): I believe that when it<br />comes to most sequels, they tend to have a high<br />chance of being successful in their box offices<br />on opening weekend (especially if the 1st garnered<br />a lot of attention and fame). When it comes<br />to Disney movies, the impact it has on younger<br />viewers allows it to increase in popularity and<br />influence and thus increase viewership. I gave<br />15% less than certain due to being certain but<br />allowing for error.","Haley Ford (100%): The success of all the Disney<br />sequels, #1 streamed movie 2023 US, success of<br />Inside Out 2,","Carson Ankeny (92.5%): There are many reasons why<br />Moana 2 is likely to be more successful. inflation<br />is a factor + sequel to a popular movie + release<br />date which historically is a successful release<br />weekend for movies + the actual projected figure<br />i found online is about $30M higher than the<br />original film","Sara Whitmire (43%): To make my prediction, I<br />will compare Moana to the Frozen franchise, which<br />contains a relatively similar plot that breaks<br />the tried-and-true Disney movie 'formula' and<br />came out around a similar timeframe (Frozen II<br />came out 9 years after the original, and Moana has<br />been out for 8 years, among other similarities).<br />While it is not an exact comparison, I believe<br />that it will inform my decisionmaking. Moana made<br />$56 million in its opening weekend, and Frozen<br />made 67 million; Frozen II, once released, made<br />$228 million. To me, the Frozen franchise is an<br />anomaly that can't be exactly replicated. The<br />Moana franchise, while successful, will likely not<br />produce a sequel more popular than the original.<br />The plotlines were pretty clearly wrapped up<br />in the first movie, and a sequel feels a bit<br />unnecessary. There isn't as much of a fandom<br />presence to buoy ticket sales. I think it will<br />be successful, but not more successful than the<br />original.","Simon Gersten (65%): Because of inflation, hype<br />surrounding the movie it makes it a possibility.<br />However, Disney movies recently have done horribly<br />because they are all woke, so it is possible that<br />it is a dud."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Moana 2 earn more at<br />the US box office in its<br />opening weekend than the<br />original film?","Will Supreme Court reform<br />be signed into law before<br />Dec 1?","Will the US federal<br />government be \"shut down\"<br />before Dec 1?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Moana 2 earn more at<br />the US box office in its<br />opening weekend than the<br />original film?","Will Supreme Court reform<br />be signed into law before<br />Dec 1?","Will the US federal<br />government be \"shut down\"<br />before Dec 1?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"127021897803":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"127076d34718":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"127021897803","visdat":{"127021897803":["function (y) ","x"],"127076d34718":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

If we’re talking<br />about 2025 and onwards, I think it has a pretty<br />good chance of getting lower and lower, but if<br />it’s just this year, it’s not going down.","David Daniels (100%): The current inflation is<br />already above 10%. I believe they are currently<br />sitting at 23% inflation year over year. This was<br />taken straight from the IMF. Since this question<br />has already come to be, I put the probability at<br />100.","Brooke Mcdermott (85%): Haiti's political climate<br />is still very volatile, which ultimately isn't<br />leading to a very stable or successful economy. I<br />compared the prices to some products from the last<br />two years to this year, and ultimately they seem<br />the same. IMF estimates that they'll be around<br />14%, which I think could be accurate, but with the<br />state that they're in right now it doesn't seem<br />probable that they'd dip below 10%. Additionally,<br />their main focus right now seems to be working<br />on humanitarian efforts due to a large number of<br />unhoused and struggling Haitians.","Ryan Foley (99%): Currently the Haitian inflation<br />rate is sitting around 30% as of the most recent<br />data from July 2024. Looking to the past the last<br />time the inflation rate dropped below 10% was in<br />2015. With the inflation being higher than that<br />point for nearly a decade straight, I don't see<br />it returning there in the next few months. With<br />the government also collapsed and the country<br />essentially being run by gangs, there would<br />need to be a miracle for the inflation rate to<br />substantially drop.","Abby Crowe (100%): I give a 100% probability<br />that Haiti’s 2024 inflation rate will be greater<br />than 10%. The current rate is about 30%, and<br />even though it is trending downwards, it will<br />not be able to drop below 10 before our December<br />deadline.","Kira Liscombe (97%): Haitis all time inflation<br />rate high was 49.30% in January of 2023.<br />Additionally, inflation in Haiti averaged 25.2%<br />in the ten years to 2022. The inflation rate<br />this year started at 20.95%, and has only grown<br />since reaching 30% in July. I looked at a 10 year<br />spread, and the last time the inflation rate was<br />below 10% was in July of 2015. Since there is<br />clearly an upward trend in inflation in recent<br />months, i think its very likely that Haiti's 2024<br />inflation rate will be greater than 10.","Jessica Armour (70%): Yes Haitis inflation rate<br />will increase, based on the articles I have read,<br />since 2023 Haitis inflation rate has consistently<br />been increasing, therefore it is safe to assume<br />that it will be grater than 10%. the inflation<br />rate has been more than 10% since 2023.","Shayna Van Glish (100%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />currently sits 28.3%, making it really likely<br />that it will stay above 10% through the end of<br />the year. Economic instability and factors such as<br />political unrest and insecurity continue to drive<br />this high inflation.","Liv Payne (100%): According to the IMF, Haiti's<br />current inflation rate is at 23%. Though this is<br />down from its peak in 2022 at 44.1%, inflation has<br />not been near 10% in recent years. Other sources<br />have similar data, and predictions still put the<br />inflation rate well over 10% carrying into the<br />next year. *site note, this is on the assumption<br />that the question is meant to conclude by December<br />1st, but the question is not clear.","Alexis Frazer (100%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />in 2024 is expected to exceed 10% due to a<br />combination of ongoing economic instability,<br />political unrest, and external shocks. The country<br />has been grappling with supply chain disruptions,<br />a weakened currency, and high import dependency,<br />which drive up the cost of goods. Additionally,<br />Haiti's inflation rate has consistently been<br />greater than 10% for the last 6 years and the<br />likelihood of it decreasing is next to 0. The<br />lack of effective government measures to stabilize<br />the economy and control prices contributes to the<br />persistent inflation, keeping it well above 10%.","William Willis (100%): At the current moment<br />Haiti's inflation rate is greater than 10%. In<br />the IMF world Economic Outlook it says that the<br />inflation rate and average consumer prices is at<br />44.1 for 2024. The projected inflation rate is<br />23% for 2024. That is a clear indicator that the<br />inflation rate will be above 10%.","Colin Barry (99%): I predict that the inflation<br />rate of Haiti will almost definitely reach higher<br />than 10% as the inflation rate of Haiti been<br />trending upward in recent years, with it being<br />over 10% each of the last few years. According to<br />the IMF measures for the inflation rate of each<br />country, the inflation rate has already reached<br />over 10% for the year and I see no reason why the<br />rate would see such a drastic drop by the end of<br />the year to fall under 10%.","Corinne O'Dell (100%): In recent years, the<br />Haitian inflation rate has been over 30%. In July<br />of 2024, the inflation rate was 30%. There is<br />nothing indicating that this rate will go down any<br />time soon, especially not anything under 10%.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (100%): As of 2023,<br />Haiti's inflation rate was at 36.81%. From what it<br />looks like in the IMF Country Data, the inflation<br />rate for the average consumer is at 44.1%. The<br />inflation for end of period consumer prices is<br />at 38.7%. I am not sure what the difference is<br />between both, but for a fact both of them are<br />above 10%. The last time inflation was under 10%<br />was in 2015. I do not see an indication that the<br />inflation rate will be below 10%.","Ladi Fashogbon (100%): Haiti’s inflation rate<br />is projected to remain well above 10% throughout<br />2024, with a 100% certainty of exceeding this<br />threshold. The current rate in 2024 stands at<br />44.1%, following 46.4% in 2023. The average<br />inflation from 2020 to 2024 was approximately<br />33.5%, reflecting a continuous upward trend.<br />The CPI for July 2024 reached 413.30 points,<br />increasing steadily since June. Haiti's dependence<br />on imports, political instability, gang violence,<br />and global disruptions, continue to drive<br />inflation. The depreciation of the Haitian gourde<br />and food inflation at 42.3% further contribute to<br />the economic challenges. With no signs of easing<br />inflationary pressures, the political and economic<br />conditions point to a 100% likelihood that Haiti’s<br />inflation rate will remain above 10% in 2024","Alex Vrolijk (90%): Haiti is recovering from some<br />very severe inflation, peaking in 2023. A model<br />predicting Haiti's inflation for 2024 is 23%. The<br />same model does not even predict Haiti's inflation<br />falling below 10% through 2029, but trying to<br />forecast years in the future is very difficult and<br />not reliable often times.","Reece Slater (100%): Although Haiti's inflation<br />rate is on a decline since a spike in 2023, there<br />is no chance it falls below 10% by Dec 1. IMF<br />World Economic Outlook has them listed at 23%<br />as of April and I see no path for them to fall<br />under 10% by Dec 1. Every statistical model I<br />have examined has them well above 10% in 2024,<br />including IMF themselves.","Rommy Etzion (99%): According to the IMF, the<br />current projected rate is 23%. From 2003-2024,<br />inflation in Haiti has averaged 15.62, which<br />is well over the 10% cutoff. The inflation rate<br />MoM, which measures the change in prices of goods<br />and services from month to month is 1.0-1.1%,<br />which does not indicate much of a change from<br />the projected 23%, and not a high enough one that<br />would indicate it being less than 10%.","Vikram Bharadwaj (100%): Given that from July<br />2023-24, the inflation rate sits at well above 20<br />percent and the current projected inflation rate<br />is more than double our projection limit of 10,<br />I find it significantly implausible that such an<br />event could occur in which inflation in Haiti dips<br />below 10% by the end of the year. Truly for such<br />an event to happen, the universe must be praying<br />on the downfall of my brier score.","Franco Bravo (97%): Due to Haiti already having<br />a very high inflation rate, it is expected for<br />it to go up even more due to economic factors and<br />overall political instability.","Victor Avila (80%): The international monetary<br />fund (or IMF) puts out a biannual world economic<br />outlook. I could not find the exact dates when<br />the seasonal editions come out, but I did find<br />that there is a fall and spring edition. That<br />being said, most sources I researches stated that<br />Haiti’s inflation rate is moving in between 25%<br />and 30% for the past 2 years. With the most-recent<br />edition coming out soon, I believe it is 80%<br />likely that the IMF will rank Haiti’s inflation<br />above 10% in this upcoming edition.","Sara Whitmire (99%): Haiti's 2024 inflation rate<br />is set at about 30% as of July of this year due<br />to weak domestic production and budget deficits,<br />among other factors. There doesn't appear to be<br />any improvement on the horizon for this inflation.","Abigail Harris (100%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />is not predicted to dip even below 15% by the<br />IMF before the end of this year. The lowest<br />inflation rate we're predicted to see even into<br />2025 is 11.5% which is still comfortably over 10%<br />given the volatility of the Haitian economy. The<br />inflation rate in Haiti also hasn't been under 10%<br />since before 2024 which doesn't exactly suggested<br />a sharp change in trend anytime soon.","Haley Ford (75%): Haiti's current inflation rate<br />is 23%, a steep drop from the previous peak of<br />44%. However, with the continued gang violence<br />and political unrest, the inflation rate would not<br />likely drop below 10%, even if it did drop;.","Carson Ankeny (100%): Per my understanding and<br />discussion with clsssmates, this has already<br />happened. So I am putting 100%. Even if it hadn’t<br />already happened, trends would indicate that it<br />would be well above 10%.","Matthew Harvey (98%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />between 03-24 of the 20th century has averaged<br />15 percent or higher and that is do to having to<br />compete and keep up with global rising prices.<br />While having to adjust their interest rates due<br />to national trading, their economy is incredibly<br />reactionary. According to statista, the inflation<br />rate of Haiti is roughly 24% and while they will<br />be dropping from that extreme value, it is not<br />projected to fall under the margins of what the<br />forecasting challenge requires of it. It takes a<br />substantial amount of time for inflation rates to<br />rise/fall with over a 10% difference which would<br />be required to bring down Haiti's. It is easier<br />to track the month to month inflation rate of<br />Haiti and the biggest jump recorded this year was<br />from March to April when it went down by a change<br />in 2.9%. However if it were to continue with<br />this trend, it still would not drop below 10%.<br />https://www.statista.com/statistics/575624/inflation-rate-in-haiti/<br />https://tradingeconomics.com/haiti/inflation-rate-mom","Gracie Culpepper (100%): I really think that<br />Haiti's inflation rate will be greater than 10%<br />because it is already higher than that and by a<br />very large amount. It's been in the 30s earlier<br />this year, and although it is projected that it<br />will fall over the next 5 years, I don't think it<br />will reach below 10% by the start of the new year.","Edward Tsui (80%): Haitis inflation rate has hit<br />record numbers this year, and it has been growing<br />since 2003. Even if the rate were to decrease,<br />it is statistically unlikely for the rate to drop<br />back down to 10% or lower before Dec 1st given<br />the current political dilemma in the country. The<br />trends in CPI do not fall that quick In a matter<br />of two-three months. Furthermore, trends show it<br />around 14% if it decreases but I think it will<br />actually get higher in the next year.","Simon Gersten (95%): Their inflation rate reached<br />30% in July and remains high, making it highly<br />unlikely they will be able to lower it by the end<br />of the year.","Leo Zegarra (89%): I strongly believe that<br />there’s a high chance that Haiti’s inflation<br />rate will exceed 10% in 2024, based on current<br />economic conditions and projections from reputable<br />institutions like the IMF, specifically. I gave<br />it an 89% chance. This high probability is due to<br />the fact that the country currently dealing with a<br />combination of economic instability, supply chain<br />disruptions, and political unrest, all of which<br />contribute to persistent inflationary pressures.<br />These factors, along with currency depreciation,<br />make it highly probable that inflation will<br />remain above 10%. The IMF’s 2024 forecast of 12.7%<br />inflation further solidifies this expectation,<br />suggesting that economic recovery will remain a<br />challenge for Haiti in the near term. That gives<br />the margin of error around 2.7%, which I think is<br />large enough to make this forecast come true.","Findleigh Ague (95%): Haiti's inflation rate has<br />been greater than 10% since 2016. Additionally,<br />the IMF World Economic from earlier this year<br />(April 2024) states that Haiti's inflation rate<br />was 23%. I just don't think it would be possible<br />for it to drop below 10% before it is updated<br />again or even by the end of the year.","Hayden Morehouse (85%): The Haiti inflation rate<br />is currently sitting around 23%. In the past Haiti<br />has been known to have a high inflation rate and I<br />believe that this trend will continue.","Kira Liscombe (100%): Per the Israeli electoin<br />cycle, the next general elections are formally<br />scheduled for October 2026. I found alot of<br />research suggesting that the Isreali public<br />generally disproves of Netanyahu's leadership<br />since the Hamas attack in October. Netanyahu is<br />Israel's longest-serving prime minister and has<br />repeatedly ruled out early elections. Even though<br />there have been some calls for it, i think its<br />very unlikely to see any changes in the next vote<br />for parliament. Under the law, a prime minister<br />can only be declared unfit for office by themself<br />or a two-thirds majority of the cabinet, and an<br />Israeli prime minister has only previously been<br />declared unfit for office once in 2006. Israel<br />is in the midst of a war that is unlikely to<br />end soon, and I doubt there will be a change in<br />leadership this year.","Ryan Foley (60%): Since the beginning of the war<br />between Israel and Hamas, Netanyahu's support has<br />wavered. In a CNN article from January of this<br />year, there were calls from 40 many high ranking<br />Israeli citizens regarding Netanyahu being removed<br />from power. As the war continues Netanyahu's<br />approval has consistently fallen. With information<br />about the atrocities of the war reaching the<br />public, much of the world has condemned the<br />country. With the war now expanding into Lebanon<br />and more civilians being killed this will likely<br />tank public perception of Israel further. However,<br />both Israel and the US continue to push forward in<br />the war, disregarding much of this criticism which<br />leads me to believe that Netanyahu could still<br />hold on to his position.","Erin Ho (70%): Based on the lack of alternative<br />candidates within Netanyahu’s party, the Likud,<br />and uncertainty about the future, Netanyahu will<br />likely remain the Israeli Prime Minister. That<br />said, there is a lot of criticism towards the lack<br />of security that caused the October 7th attacks,<br />not to mention all the hostages still left<br />unsaved.","Abigail Harris (90%): An outside force like the<br />American government, a known Israeli backer,<br />or the UN likely wouldn’t try to remove any<br />world leader in the middle of a major conflict<br />especially one which amounts to armed conflict.<br />Biden isn’t likely to attempt to remove him<br />because of the upcoming election despite tensions<br />over hostage recovery. The people in line to<br />replace Netanyahu include economic and foreign<br />affairs ministers from his own party but with the<br />next election in 2026 and tensions likely to only<br />grow deeper the longer conflict rages on I feel it<br />would only benefit them to wait.","Minha Ahmad (80%): I would say that it is highly<br />likely that Benjamin Netanyahu will still be<br />the prime minister of Israel by December 1st.<br />According to the Times of Israel, the next<br />election for Israel will not be until 2026, and<br />government officials and members of parliament<br />have stated that Netanyahu will stay prime<br />minister until the war in Gaza is over. It is<br />unlikely that the war will end in the next couple<br />of months, especially since Israel has began to<br />attack other countries in the Middle East, like<br />Lebanon, and has refused to agree to several<br />ceasefire pleas and pleas from organizations like<br />the United Nations who have voted for an end to<br />the war.","Hayden Morehouse (90%): The next election is<br />not until 2026. That means he would have to be<br />impeached or killed in the conflict. While I think<br />the probability of that is low it is never 0 hence<br />why I left some room here and picked 90.","Colin Barry (90%): I would say it is pretty likely<br />that Netanyahu will still be in power by December<br />1st, as during his recent term several laws have<br />been put into place to make it harder to remove<br />him from his position. The next general election<br />for prime minister in Israel will not be until<br />2026, which would be the next best chance for him<br />to leave or be removed from office. Since I do<br />not think it is likely he will be removed over the<br />next two months.","Brooke Mcdermott (90%): I highly doubt he will<br />step down, additionally Israel parliament formed<br />a law last year that made it incredibly hard to<br />impeach or remove the prime minister from office<br />without HIS affirmation or 3/4 of his cabinet. I<br />think if the U.S. were to back another coalition<br />to complete with Netanyahu, it would be after the<br />president next year is inaugurated.","Abby Crowe (95%): I give a 95% probability that<br />Netanyahu will still be the Israeli PM on our<br />deadline. While many have been protesting his<br />government, it is unlikely to change anything<br />because of the wartime aspects surrounding the<br />country. Governments are unlikely to turnover<br />during war time, he regained political capital<br />with the sophistication of the Lebanon pager<br />attacks, and there is not a rescheduled election<br />until 2026. Even if elections were called, it<br />is unlikely that it would follow through before<br />December.","David Daniels (97%): Benjamin Netanyahu is<br />currently the longest-tenured prime minister.<br />While some people are calling for his resignation,<br />it seems unlikely that Israel would risk<br />a government change in the midst of a war,<br />especially considering the timeliness of the<br />matter, as it needs to be resolved before<br />December. Another thing to consider is that<br />the next election isn't until 2026. Given these<br />factors, my estimation of a 3 percent error is<br />only based on the chance of him passing away while<br />in office. I find this very unlikely and assign a<br />97% probability that Benjamin Netanyahu will still<br />be in office come December.","Jessica Armour (85%): The Prime Minister of Israel<br />can remain the Prime Minister indefinitely. With<br />that being said, it is unlikely that Netanyahu<br />will not continue to be Prime Minister as his term<br />has not been completed yet and the election for<br />the Knesset will happen in a few years. Therefore<br />with the war and the election being so far away he<br />will most likely still be in office by December.","Simon Gersten (70%): Base off of the current rate<br />at which the war is going, Netanyahu is likely to<br />maintain his coalition, but if events go sideways,<br />he will lose his coalition and a new vote will be<br />placed. I do now think this is likely.","Corinne O'Dell (90%): Benjamin Netanyahu is likely<br />to remain Israel's Prime Minister by December<br />1, 2024. Netanyahu's leadership is currently<br />reinforced by the ongoing war following the<br />October 7 Hamas attacks, as he has been able<br />to unite much of the country under a wartime<br />government. Israel's next elections are not<br />scheduled until October 2026, so there is a high<br />probability Netanyahu will remain til Dec. 1.","Shayna Van Glish (87%): I think that there is an<br />87% probability that Netanyahu is still in power<br />on Dec 1. It is highly unlikely that there would<br />be a vote of no confidence or collapse of the<br />coalition by this date. While he is very unliked<br />by many citizens, it is not likely that a new<br />coalition will be formed by Dec 1.","Jeffrey Markowitz (100%): There is no chance that<br />he will be removed from office at this point by<br />anything short of a coup.","Vikram Bharadwaj (95%): The fact that Netanyahu<br />is currently stiff PM signals the fact that there<br />is no real chance that he would willingly step<br />down. There is no reason for him to, along with<br />the fact that he essentially has no opposition<br />within his base due to the their strong support<br />for the current military operations. The Knesset<br />knows that any change to leadership now is a<br />terrible idea for every given operation and is not<br />at all in the best interest of national security.<br />The only reason why I shy away from 100% is the<br />5 % chance that Netanyahu dies, either by age or<br />assassination which I feel given the significance<br />of the war.","Leo Zegarra (91%): I gave this question a 91%<br />chance. Benjamin Netanyahu seems to be very<br />confident that h will remain Israeli Prime<br />Minister for some time and I don't see any changes<br />happening by December 1st. His current coalition<br />is stable, and no immediate elections are planned,<br />which is a huge factor for me. Many reports also<br />also display Netanyahu as being very politically<br />resilient.","Alexis Frazer (90%): Benjamin Netanyahu is likely<br />to remain Prime Minister on December 1 due to his<br />political acumen, a solid coalition, and ongoing<br />support from key voter bases. Despite challenges,<br />his administration has effectively navigated<br />economic and security issues, allowing him to<br />maintain influence and control within Israel's<br />complex political landscape.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (90%): Netanyahu has held<br />office since 2009. Officially, the next elections<br />will be held in 2026. After reading up on some<br />facts, I learned that Netanyahu has lost some<br />popularity in Israel. Some people have called for<br />early elections. However, I do not think this is<br />an immediate cause for concern. I think that the<br />process for an early election would take a longer<br />time than what we have.","William Willis (80%): After researching the<br />following question for our class on will Benjamin<br />Netanyahu still be the Israeli Prime Minister on<br />Dec 1, I have come to the probability that there<br />is an 80% chance that he will still be the prime<br />minister by Dec 1. I have concluded that as long<br />as the war is going on he will remain in power.<br />The war has almost been going on for a year. I<br />think the reason why he will remain in power is if<br />the war continues and it seems like there are no<br />signs of it slowing down.","Ladi Fashogbon (75%): Netanyahu currently holds<br />office and has significant political experience,<br />having been Prime Minister multiple times. There<br />is too much political instability to replace him.","Rommy Etzion (95%): Check Briefing :)","Victor Avila (95%): The reason I gave this a 95<br />percent probability is because I find it highly<br />unlikely that Netanyahu will be out of office, in<br />which he would have to call an early election and<br />lose it. Chuck Shcumer has called for Netanyahu<br />to call an early election and believes they<br />must elect someone else to deal with Hamas in<br />which Netanyahu refused to commit to holding<br />new elections when the war winds down and said<br />Schumer's comments were \"totally inappropriate.\"<br />Not to mention Netanyahu has just only started<br />escalating war in Lebanon so I find it highly<br />unlikely he holds early elections.","Matthew Harvey (95%): The probability that<br />Netanyahu stays in control is incredibly high.<br />First and foremost, Israel is in the midst of<br />a full on war with Lebanon. Whenever wars and<br />conflicts occur in any government, the worst<br />thing to do is to transfer power over and hold an<br />election. Look at in the past when Roosevelt held<br />power during the events of WW2. By transferring<br />power, it could cause turmoil and instability that<br />could lead to issues. Another reason why Netanyahu<br />will stay in power is due to his massive support<br />from the government. While the people of Israel<br />might not have faith in him and disapprove of<br />the government, those in power currently rally<br />behind Netanyahu and his values. I have no doubt<br />that while this conflict goes on and there is<br />instability in the Middle East, he will remain in<br />power.","Gracie Culpepper (87%): After doing research<br />and using wisdom of the crowd, I think more than<br />likely he will still be the prime minister by the<br />start of December. In order for him to not be,<br />there would have to be some form of annexation or<br />military coup, which I think is strongly unlikely<br />to occur before the beginning of December.","Alex Vrolijk (95%): With the war in Gaza having<br />no end in sight still and Israel's new offensive<br />in Lebanon, I do not see why Netanyahu would<br />be replaced by December 1st. Even with public<br />pressure, I do not expect Netanyahu or Israel's<br />offensive to see any significant change. I believe<br />the only way Netanyahu is not PM by December 1st<br />is if he were assassinated/killed.","John Mathis (75%): There has been no sign that<br />Netanyahu is even thinking about stepping down<br />now, and has said quite the opposite. There has<br />been calls for him to step down for months from<br />all sides, but I still do not think it is enough.<br />Similarly, 70% of Israelis want an early election,<br />but there has been no indication of Netanyahu<br />caving to these demands.","Haley Ford (84%): The political situation in<br />Israel is unpredictable - with the 2018-2022<br />Israel Political crisis as evidence of early<br />elections and political turnovers. However, the<br />next election isn't scheduled until 2026, and even<br />if an election is called early, there will have<br />to be an announcement period, campaign period,<br />voting, etc. which would likely take 3-4 months<br />in of itself. Given that is nearing October, if<br />it did occur in early October, at the earliest<br />it would time out to be early December--at the<br />earliest, which would likely not be exactly<br />December 1st. Other factors include the ongoing<br />Gaza war, which there is opposition against<br />Netanyahu, but would be more likely to result in<br />election until the war is over.","Edward Tsui (95%): Israel's general election<br />for the Knesset is in October of 2026. Despite<br />Ben Netanyahu's striking polarity in approval,<br />Israel would probably not oust their current Prime<br />Minister for war crimes unless a special election<br />is determined upon impeachment, and the war in<br />Gaza were to come to a ceasefire. The likelihood<br />of an impeachment is lower since January of 2024<br />since Ben implemented newer legislation that would<br />make it harder to oust a Prime Minister aside from<br />health and mental reasons. Furthermore, the war in<br />Gaza is unlikely to come to an end before December<br />1st regardless of who is elected in the US General<br />election come November 5th.","Findleigh Ague (80%): Benjamin Netanyahu assumed<br />office in 2022, meaning that his four-year term<br />is not over until 2026. That being said, Netanyahu<br />has been met with a lot of backlash and opposition<br />and has been urged by many to hold an election<br />because many believe that he would not win<br />reelection. Even though this is true, now we have<br />to consider if this election will actually happen<br />before December 1st this year. Benny Gantz, one<br />of the cabinet members of Israel, urged Netanyahu<br />to settle on a date for elections in September,<br />which is obviously not going to be happening.<br />Gantz knows that polls suggest his party would<br />come out on top and that he would be favored to<br />be the next prime minister, and Netanyahu knows<br />that it would be an unwise decision for himself to<br />hold a reelection when many believe that he would<br />not be reelected. He claims that an election right<br />now would just be giving into Hamas and would<br />paralyze Israel and their efforts to establish a<br />hostage deal. Based on his beliefs on the matter<br />and the fact that there is no required election<br />until 2026, I don't think that it is extremely<br />likely for there to be an election before December<br />1st. However, if there is, I think that there is a<br />pretty good chance that he will not be reelected","Sara Whitmire (87%): Israel's next election is in<br />2026, so there's no chance of him being officially<br />voted out by Israeli citizens. Israel is currently<br />in the midst of multiple international conflicts,<br />with Netanyahu at the helm, and a change in<br />leadership is not the state's first priority and<br />would not be conducive to success in these foreign<br />conflicts. Internationally and locally, there is<br />criticism of Netanyahu's policy, but there's not<br />a big chance of him resigning or being impeached.<br />I won't exactly rule out assassination, given how<br />2024 is going, and there has been at least one<br />assassination in Israeli history.","Franco Bravo (80%): Like I mentioned in my paper,<br />I believe that Netenyahu will still be in power<br />by December 1st. With support from his party still<br />there, and also support from the US still being<br />there aswell, I dont believe that he steps down<br />anytime soon. Furthermore, Netenyahu seems like an<br />individual that will not give up and does not step<br />down even with massive amounts of pressure.","Carson Ankeny (99%): While there is existing<br />international pressure for Netanyahu to resign,<br />there is not enough internal pressure on him to<br />be removed from office through election or other<br />means. Especially with the recent conflicts with<br />Hezbollah, he has seen a surge in support within<br />Israel which will help him hold on to the Prime<br />Ministership likely until the scheduled 2026<br />elections and beyond. He has held the PM position<br />for decades now and it is unlikely that now is<br />when he will lose that position, which he has no<br />intentions of giving up willingly.","Abby Crowe (80%): I predict an 80% chance that the<br />FPO will win the most seats in Austria’s September<br />parliamentary elections due to their consistently<br />growing popularity. They have been favored to<br />win the most seats in this election all the way<br />back to 2022 and are in line with the rise of far<br />right parties in other European countries. Because<br />of the longstanding prediction of their expected<br />majority, I expect a high chance.","Brooke Mcdermott (85%): The FPO has shown positive<br />growth in approval ratings and polls since the<br />beginning of the month. Additionally, the outgoing<br />chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has seen an increase<br />in disapproval of his leadership since he started<br />his chancellorship in 2021. Nehammer belongs to<br />the OVP, the other Austrian far-right party, which<br />has not gained as much traction from the media<br />in terms of the race. I do think the prevalence<br />of FPO's breakthrough/predicted success is due to<br />their historical win in the EU Parliament in June,<br />which could also be contributed as to why everyone<br />believes they are going to gain the majority of<br />seats for the national election.","Gracie Culpepper (42%): Although they are leading<br />in the polls right now, it is unlikely that the<br />FPO party in Austria will actually win a majority<br />of the seats. There has been a big push throughout<br />Europe though for more right-wing parties to<br />stop immigration, so I don't think this is highly<br />unlikely.","Colin Barry (60%): I think it is slightly more<br />than likely that the FPO will win the most seats<br />in the election for the first time in its history.<br />As OVP has been trending down in polls ahead of<br />the election while FPO has stayed strong in its<br />numbers for the most part. However, I do not think<br />they will win enough seats for a majority in the<br />government this election.","David Daniels (82%): Based on current projections<br />and polls, it seems likely that the FBO will win<br />more seats than any other party. All the sources<br />I've found agree that the FBO will be the leading<br />party. Therefore, I estimate a 82% probability of<br />this outcome.","Vikram Bharadwaj (85%): FPO currently leads the<br />polls by a significant margin of 3%, and with the<br />general downward trend for the OVP along with the<br />overall increase in far-right populist parties<br />across Europe, I find it heavily likely that<br />the FPO will win the most seats out of any other<br />party. Now it is realistic that there could be<br />a sudden OVP victory with them winning the most<br />seats, but I personally find that highly unlikely<br />as most news agencies along with the polling<br />data project the FPO to come in with the historic<br />victory.","Alex Vrolijk (85%): This is because the FPO has<br />been leading Australia's public polls for a year.<br />The FPO has also grown a gap between themselves<br />and the second place OVP. Due to European<br />sentiment shifting further right due to factors<br />including immigration, I believe the FPO will win<br />more seats than any other party.","Minha Ahmad (48%): According to Euronews, the FPO<br />is currently leading in the polls. However, they<br />are leading with 28%, so even if they win their<br />share, they are not likely to get a full majority.","William Willis (40%): At the moment it looks<br />like the FPO is leading in the polls with a 28%<br />of the vote. But it seems that it needs to find<br />a coalition partner in order to govern. I also<br />highly doubt that they will win because they have<br />never won in history. I highly doubt that they<br />will be able to form a coalition.","Victor Avila (68%): Although I could not find<br />much information on if a party can still win the<br />most seats and not rule, I gave the FPO winning<br />more seats than any other party a 68 percent<br />probability. On the Austrian polls that I found,<br />it seems like the FPO is ahead at 27% with the OVP<br />trailing behind at 24% with the OVP party approval<br />rating falling and anti-immigration/refugee<br />rhetoric on the rise, I find it likely that like<br />will occur.","Liv Payne (70%): In 2019, the FOO had 31 seats,<br />putting it at third place behind the OVP and SPO.<br />Since then, the two other groups have made some<br />political decisions that have not curried favor<br />within the public, meaning their approval rates<br />have dropped significantly. According to a poll by<br />The institute for Demoscopy and Data Analysis, the<br />OVP has dropped from over 40% in 2020 to barely<br />25% in September of 2024. SPO now sits at around<br />20%. The FPO leads with around 27%, and all other<br />polls have shown support for the far right group.<br />Therefore I find it more likely than not that the<br />fpo will have more seats than the other groups,<br />but it is important to recognize that having more<br />seats is not equivalent to the majority. In order<br />to have a majority and the Austrian Parliament<br />a group needs to have 92 seats, which according<br />to the data I was able to collect for my power<br />went out, it's not something that has happened in<br />recent years. In 2019, the OVP had 71 seats, but<br />I don't believe that the FPO will gain that many,<br />even if they do win the most number of seats.","Leo Zegarra (78%): The FPO is likely to win<br />more seats than any other party in Austria's<br />September elections, and I gave it a 78% chance<br />of happening. This reflects their strong polling<br />performance and voter sentiment favoring their<br />stance on immigration and economic issues, amid<br />dissatisfaction with current ruling parties.<br />According to the most recent 4 elections, the<br />party that has polled the best ended up winning<br />more seats than any other party in each election.<br />However, the OVP party is the incumbent party and<br />also is neck and neck in terms of polling. Either<br />way, I now know that people are not particularly<br />content with that party and want a new party in<br />the majority since the OVP have had more seats<br />since 2017.","Alexis Frazer (72%): From what I’ve researched,<br />the FPO party is favored to get a majority in the<br />upcoming election and currently holds 30 of the<br />183 seats, and won 16.2% of votes cast in the 2019<br />legislative election and it is represented in all<br />nine state legislatures."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Benjamin Netanyahu<br />still be the Israeli<br />Prime Minister on Dec 1?","Will Haiti's 2024<br />inflation rate be greater<br />than 10%?","Will the FPO win more<br />seats than any other<br />party in Austria's<br />September parliamentary<br />elections?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Benjamin Netanyahu<br />still be the Israeli<br />Prime Minister on Dec 1?","Will Haiti's 2024<br />inflation rate be greater<br />than 10%?","Will the FPO win more<br />seats than any other<br />party in Austria's<br />September parliamentary<br />elections?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"12707a0f659e":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"1270d6016bb":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"12707a0f659e","visdat":{"12707a0f659e":["function (y) ","x"],"1270d6016bb":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Based on the generic ballot,<br />Democrats are up +1.8 points nationally, which<br />corresponds to an expected seat share of roughly<br />210 and a 22% chance of winning the House.<br />District-level projections from outlets like<br />Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball<br />suggest that Democrats have 190 solid/likely seats<br />compared to 201 Republican solid/likely seats, a<br />very large deficit (something like a 7-8% chance<br />of winning all the necessary toss-up seats).<br />Prediction markets like Metaculus and Polymarket<br />are more bullish (45% and 63% respectively), but<br />these are not the sort of liquid markets we've<br />seen in past elections (Americans need Bitcoin<br />and a VPN to bet in Polymarket), so I take these<br />estimates with a grain of salt. YouGov's MRP model<br />gives Democrats a 57% chance, but this model's<br />track record is untested (they published an MRP<br />House model once in 2018 and the result was barely<br />within the 95% confidence interval). Aggregating<br />these forecasts, I land on 33%.","Joe Ornstein (15%): There have been nearly two<br />dozen polls fielded on this municipal race in<br />the past month, and the general consensus is<br />that the incumbent mayor Ricardo Nunes will make<br />it to the top-two runoff, and, conditional on<br />making it to the runoff, will crush any opponent<br />by double-digit margins. Going back to 2008,<br />these head-to-head second round polls seem to be<br />reliable predictors of who will win.","Joe Ornstein (3%): The recent Federal Reserve<br />interest rate cut reflects a general consensus<br />among economists that rising unemployment is now<br />a greater risk than inflation. Though a \"soft<br />landing\" is the most likely outcome, there is<br />a non-negligible risk that the economy enters a<br />recession by the end of 2024. If the East coast<br />dockworkers' strike continues for an extended<br />period, it could compound that risk. All that<br />said, historically a 0.8 percentage point rise in<br />the unemployment rate almost never occurs within<br />the span of two months, even at the onset of a<br />recession. (The COVID-19 pandemic is a notable<br />exception; one would only expect such a rapid<br />rise in unemployment if a catastrophe of a similar<br />magnitude occurred between now and December.)","Joe Ornstein (10%): IANAL, but I have read<br />through the lawsuit and the relevant sections<br />of the Election Code (Chapter 183-1-12) and<br />the case for striking down the newly-adopted<br />Hand Count Rule seems strong on the merits. The<br />change is last-minute (potentially violating<br />Purcell doctrine), contradicts several other<br />subsections of the Election Code pertaining to the<br />security and custody of paper ballots, and seems<br />inconsistent with statutes passed by the General<br />Assembly clarifying that ballots be tabulated at<br />the level of the election superintendent rather<br />than the precinct. The Georgia Attorney General<br />and Secretary of State (both Republicans) have<br />publicly stated that they believe the SEB's rule<br />oversteps its authority. The case is likely to be<br />heard and decided within two weeks."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,0)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.80000000000000004],"y":[4.9717065627453847],"text":"Joe Ornstein (80%): Despite Putin's stated orders<br />to repel Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast<br />by October 1, Ukraine still occupies the vast<br />majority of the territory it took during its<br />August offensive.

I predict below a coin toss because of<br />the majority that the republican party holds now,<br />and the amount of toss up seats projected for<br />this election. While it is completely possible for<br />the democratic party to win a majority, they have<br />several obstacles to doing so.","Ryan Foley (60%): Currently, Democrats and<br />Republicans hold 212 and 220 seats in the House<br />respectively. There are 24 toss-up elections<br />in the House and with the presidency looking<br />increasingly like it will go blue, it seems<br />like the House could follow suit. With the<br />recent funding issues in the House, I feel like<br />Republicans may be negatively stigmatized. This<br />on top of recent controversies that keep appearing<br />within the Republican party, it may become harder<br />for voters to connect with candidates in these<br />toss-up elections. Many of the Republican toss-ups<br />are found in Democratic states as well, leading me<br />to believe these could turn blue this election.","Ladi Fashogbon (51%): The Democratic Party is<br />projected to win between 205 and 236 seats, while<br />Republicans are predicted to hold 199 seats, with<br />many toss-up districts yet to be decided​( Solid<br />Purple )​( The Hill ). Thus, the probability of<br />Democrats winning a majority currently ranges from<br />about 49% to 51%, Given these details, i believe<br />they would have an ever slight edge based on the<br />amount of seats.","Hayden Morehouse (62%): I got this answer from<br />a forcasting account. I presume its a bit of a<br />tossup but I wanted to lean a certain way and my<br />research led me to leaning towards the democratic<br />party holding a majority of the seats.","Gracie Culpepper (57%): I went through the 22<br />districts that are labelled as toss-ups and did<br />my own research to determine how I think each<br />district will vote. I also think that Kamala<br />taking the ticket instead of Biden this election<br />will help democrats gain more seats in the HOR.<br />However, the numbers I came up with is 219-216<br />which is incredibly close, and I also have my own<br />biases that may have affected how I looked at each<br />particular district. For these reasons, I'm saying<br />57%.","Kira Liscombe (73%): Republicans currently hold<br />the house majority in the 118th Congress, which<br />is one of the narrowest margins in U.S. history.<br />According to PEW Reasearch Center, margins of<br />control of fewer than 5 percentage points have<br />prevailed in a third of the 15 most recent<br />Houses. YouGov's 2024 House model predicts a<br />Republican Majority in Senate and Democratic<br />Majority in the House with a median prediction<br />of Democrats winning with 219 seats (based on<br />a series of 3,000 simulations). This is backed<br />up by other forecasting platforms such as Race<br />to the Whitehouse which favors Democrats with a<br />63.2% Chance to win a majority, based on 20,000<br />simulations every update. I dont think a win is<br />set in stone for the Democratic party, but it<br />seems that they are definitley favored to grab a<br />House majority in the next election.","Erin Ho (58%): As of recent events, Ricardo Nunes,<br />the incumbent Mayor or Brazil, and Guilherme<br />Boulos, one of the top challengers, are currently<br />locked in a tie for the Sao Paulo mayoral race.<br />Nunes has the backing of former President Jair<br />Bolsonaro, a far-right conservative, while Boulos<br />has the backing of the current President Luiz<br />Inacio Lula da Silva. Things are close between the<br />two candidates, due to Boulos having progressive<br />voters' support and Nunes having conservative<br />supporters. A recent poll shows that Nunes has a<br />mere 1% head on Boulos, which means this election<br />could go either way in the coming week, perhaps<br />even going into a runoff.","Erin Ho (46%): There is a small gap between the<br />Democrats and the Republicans in the House, which<br />can change either way depending on what happens<br />in the next few weeks. Right now, it comes down<br />to a few things like how the economy looks, what<br />policies they support or want to implement, and<br />perhaps incumbents' possible open seats with House<br />politicians stepping down.","Ryan Foley (35%): The Sao Paulo election is<br />plagued with controversy this year as physical<br />brawls have broken out between candidates during<br />debates. Nunes, the current leader in the most<br />recent polling, looks set to win re-election<br />as mayor as Marcal, the cause of many of the<br />fights, follows about 5 points behind. Marcal<br />has been seen the most media attention because<br />of his actions, but still cannot garner the votes<br />to defeat Nunes. Having a widely known criminal<br />record, Marcal struggles to connect with voters.<br />With Nunes having incumbency advantage as well, I<br />see him holding onto his position as mayor.","Liv Payne (62%): It seems that this is going to<br />be a rather close race. Currently, Republicans<br />have a majority with 222 seats (218 needed for<br />majority), but this current race is expected to<br />have less than a 5 seat difference. One source<br />I found (https://www.racetothewh.com/house ,<br />I highly recommend it, it has some fascinating<br />data and predictions) said that Democrats have<br />a 63.3% chance, showing that, in recent months,<br />Republicans have rapidly lost the public's favor.<br />Another source, Split-Ticket.org gives Democrats<br />a 58% chance of winning the majority. I chose 62%<br />because it feels like the race is extremely close,<br />and I trust the simulations run by Race to the WH,<br />since they have a high accuracy rating.","Colin Barry (60%): I think that the democrats have<br />a more than likely chance of winning the house in<br />November in a very tight race with Republicans. I<br />think this because of the many toss up districts<br />I think there is a slight edge in favor of the<br />Democratic Party. I do think the race is very<br />close, however, and that's why I only give a 60%<br />of them winning.","Colin Barry (40%): I think that it is unlikely<br />that there will be a new mayor in Sao Paulo, as<br />in recent weeks the incumbent candidate, Nunes,<br />has began to surge in recent weeks. I expect this<br />trend to continue as Nunes has the most free air<br />time allocate to him by the state based on how<br />many sets the party has in their congress.","Victor Avila (58%): Right now, the house is<br />composed of 220 Republicans and 212 Democrats with<br />3 vacant spots due to 2 deaths and 1 resignation<br />(1 Republican, 2 Democrats), with all 435 up for<br />grabs in November. At least 203 of these seats are<br />favored to lean Democrat, 211 seats are favored<br />to lean republican, and 25 are complete toss ups<br />according to the Cook political report. 12 of<br />the 25 that are toss ups are currently republican<br />held, while 10 are held by democrats (other 3 are<br />vacancies). While 7/12 republican held toss up<br />seats polls have democrat opponents ahead, so I<br />think democrats will hold the majority of seats<br />after the 2024 house elections.","Simon Gersten (60%): Based off of current<br />data, Democrats hold a slight lead in many of<br />the elections, but the polling remains within<br />the margin of error. It is likely to early to<br />accurately forecast this, but given current<br />trends, and assuming polling is relatively<br />accurate, which it has not always been, but it is<br />the only available data, Democrats are likely to<br />win a majority.","David Daniels (34%): Ricardo Nunes is currently<br />leading in almost every poll I've seen, with a<br />significant margin. Considering the historical<br />tendency for incumbent re-elections, it seems<br />unlikely that a new mayor will be elected in São<br />Paulo. Based on the numbers I've seen, Ricardo<br />Nunes is polling nearly 2-3% above the second<br />closest candidate, Guilherme Boulos. Taking these<br />projections and historical trends into account, I<br />estimate a 34% probability of São Paulo electing a<br />new major.","Simon Gersten (35%): I wrote a memo for this<br />question.","David Daniels (44%): According to current poll<br />projections, the GOP is in a favorable position in<br />both the House and the Senate. The outcome of the<br />elections is uncertain and could go either way,<br />like a coin flip. As of now, I believe it's more<br />likely that the GOP will take the House instead of<br />the Democrats, so I estimate a 44% probability of<br />the Democrats taking the House.","Brooke Mcdermott (35%): Most of the sources I<br />reviewed varied the toss-up seats between 11-24.<br />Majority of them were calling a Republican<br />majority in seats, some saying there would be a<br />Democratic by a very small margin.","Abby Crowe (40%): With my very limited<br />understanding of Brazil’s politics, I predict a<br />40% chance that there is a new Mayor after this<br />year’s municipal elections. There is projected<br />to be a runoff between the top two parties after<br />the regular election, and to my understanding-<br />the split vote on the 3rd party will favor the<br />incumbent in a runoff and therefore Nunes will<br />remain the mayor.","Corinne O'Dell (40%): The race for control<br />of the U.S. House of Representatives remains<br />highly competitive. Current projections suggest<br />that the Republicans have a slight edge, with<br />a 54% chance of retaining control of the House.<br />Republicans currently hold a narrow majority, and<br />the Democrats would need to flip just five seats<br />to regain control. However, with numerous key<br />races categorized as toss-ups, the outcome remains<br />uncertain.","Corinne O'Dell (53%): Incumbent mayor Ricardo<br />Nunes, who took office after the passing of Bruno<br />Covas, is polling at around 20-25%. Guilherme<br />Boulos, a left-leaning candidate from the<br />Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), leading with<br />around 28-30% support. Boulos has a strong base<br />among young, working-class voters, focusing on<br />issues like affordable housing and social justice.<br />The outcome is still uncertain, but Boulos<br />currently holds the edge.","Minha Ahmad (42%): I would say that it is unlikely<br />that there will be a new mayor in Sao Paulo<br />after the election. Recently, there was a very<br />publicized incident in which two of the candidates<br />got into a fight in which one threw a chair at<br />the other. Needless to say, it is highly unlikely<br />either of those candidates will win. The previous<br />mayor, Ricardo Nunes, is running for reelection. I<br />think it is possible that he will win, especially<br />since his other candidates are not necessarily<br />great prospects.","Minha Ahmad (45%): Currently, the Republicans<br />hold the majority of seats in the House of<br />Representatives. According to Newsweek, polls<br />show that voters are closely divided ahead of this<br />year's elections, which means that both parties<br />have a chance of winning a majority. I can not<br />confidently say that the Democrats will win a<br />majority, however at the same time, can not fully<br />rule out this possibility.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (38%): Currently, there<br />is a Republican majority in the House. Both The<br />Hill and the Wall Street Journal predict GOP<br />winning the House. The GOP party also has more<br />\"secured\" safe seats than the Democratic Party.<br />However, \"Race to the White House\" is the only<br />forecast website I could find that predicts an<br />entire different outcome. They have the Democratic<br />Party gaining control of the House at 65%. I<br />looked at the presidential elections from 2000 to<br />2020 and observed that if a Democratic candidate<br />wins presidency, it is likely for the House to be<br />the same.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (65%): Guilherme Boulos<br />leads most polls with a recent one showing a<br />three-way tie with the Ricardo Nunes (incumbent)<br />and Pablo Marcal (crazy chair-throwing candidate).<br />Boulos has the support of the current president,<br />who is supported by 48% of Brazilians (according<br />to Pew Research). In the Sixth Republic, only<br />two mayors have been re-elected. For this reason,<br />I believe that a new mayor will be elected, and<br />that would be Boulos, who is more outspoken about<br />social justice issues that resonate more with Sao<br />Paulo.","Vikram Bharadwaj (30%): Okay so there are a total<br />of 24 tossup seats, with democrats needing 15 and<br />republicans needing 10 in order to reach 218. If<br />we do the calculations of 2^24 (literally flipping<br />a coin 24 times) and set k=10, we see that out<br />of the 16.8 million universes, republicans win in<br />84.63% of them, with Dems winning in 15.37%. Now<br />while I would love to fully send on the 15% based<br />purely on the math, it is important to consider<br />the realistic scenario's in which Democrats could<br />potentially win as they historically have greater<br />turnout during general elections, winning the<br />house back in 2020. However I feel like 2024,<br />has turned somewhat back to business as usual,<br />meaning that there is a greater chance that people<br />will just look for change, leading to republicans<br />keeping the house by a slim majority.","Vikram Bharadwaj (30%): A major factor in this<br />is the incumbent advantage along with positive<br />polling numbers for the incumbent. With both of<br />these combined there is a great shot for Nunes to<br />win his election. On top of this, with a greater<br />shift towards the right within Brazil, more power<br />is being gained by Nunes' party, along with the<br />fact that the current far-right candidate has lost<br />a lot of support meaning that that support will<br />likely go to Nunes, giving him an even greater<br />advantage to win this election.","Alexis Frazer (25%): Redistricting after the<br />2020 census has led to more Republican-leaning<br />districts, and the historical trend of the party<br />in power losing seats in midterm elections adds<br />to their difficulties. Republicans currently<br />house more seats, and incumbents are consistently<br />favored in elections. I also believe a lot of<br />moderate repubicans who may vote for Kamala will<br />vote to fill the house and senate with republican<br />candidates.","Alexis Frazer (32%): Both candidates do not seem<br />particulary well liked by the general public,<br />they trade insults with one another, spread<br />lies, and do not behave in a proper political<br />manner. However, Marçal, although he shows slight<br />favoritism in the polls, recieves more public<br />backlash, as he often hates publicly on current<br />'woke' culture. The current mayor, is also<br />generally disliked, however tolerated, by the<br />people.","Jeffrey Markowitz (63.3%): Probability given by<br />racetothewh.com","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): Nunes still remains at<br />teh top of the polls, even though the margin is<br />close.","Reece Slater (53%): I think this one is almost<br />impossible to tell and virtually a coin flip.<br />While Republicans have more seats on lock, I<br />think Democrats have a razor thin edge in terms of<br />flipping seats. Every model I have looked at has<br />something different, but I will give Democrats the<br />slight edge.","Reece Slater (32%): I think that the incumbent,<br />Nunes, will remain mayor. He has a slight lead<br />in the polls among the pool of candidates, around<br />1-4%, but when polled head to head with the two<br />other leading candidates, he smokes them by around<br />15 points. It is possible that a new mayor is<br />sworn in as there are a number of candidates, I<br />think Nunes will still remain mayor. Also, the<br />incumbent advantage is in play which gives him a<br />natural boost.","John Mathis (56%): Overall, I think I will give<br />Democrats a 56% chance of taking back the House of<br />representatives. There are a ton of seats that are<br />a toss-up, so I personally think there is a lot<br />of room for variation and I cannot with certainty<br />say that one side is even likely to win the house.<br />House Races are also notoriously under-polled, and<br />the ones that do poll can be very inaccurate or<br />biased. The reason I give this one to democrats is<br />because the models tend to show a Dem flip to be<br />slightly more likely, with the models that show a<br />Republican House having it be by an even smaller<br />majority than in 2022.","Rommy Etzion (43%): Polling varies greatly<br />regarding if the Democrats or Republicans are<br />to win a majority of the seats in the house,<br />and whichever one wins will likely hold a slim<br />majority. There has been some redistricting,<br />many favoring the Democrats but some giving<br />the Republicans a slight edge and potentially<br />flipping Democratic-held seats. Kamala Harris’<br />approval ratings are growing following the recent<br />presidential debate, which often has an influence<br />on the house election, but the manner of this<br />election is not a solid indicator. Currently, the<br />Democrats are raising election funds in national<br />committees and super PACs. A difficult aspect<br />to consider is the hot-topics. While the House<br />is more focused on local issues, I project that<br />many will be voting on the current hot-topics,<br />which are the ongoing regional wars, abortion for<br />Democrats, and immigration for Republicans. While<br />democratic voters seem divided on the Israel-Hamas<br />War, they are united against restrictibe abortion<br />laws. It will be very close.","Rommy Etzion (40%): Based on recent polls that<br />have not fluctuate much since the release of the<br />first numbers and the start of the debates, Nunes<br />and Boulos are leading the race with between<br />24-27%. Marcal is not far behind with around<br />21%, but the municipal elections require more<br />than 50% of the votes to win. If a candidate<br />fails to receive a majority, then the election<br />goes to a runoff on October 27th. It is likely<br />for the elections to continue in the runoffs,<br />and then the two leading parties remain on the<br />ballet. Regardless of whether the runoff includes<br />Boulos or Marcel, it is likely that Marcal is a<br />candidate. Then, the election will be very close.<br />I expect it to lean for Boulos because Marcel’s<br />right-leaning voters may change their vote to<br />Nunes, and the majority of San Paulo voters<br />identify as right-wing. That being said it will<br />be a close election and I am not confident to who<br />will win.","Edward Tsui (35%): This year, about 90% of<br />House seats are deemed uncompetitive. This is a<br />continuing reality in the House: In 2022, 84% of<br />House seats were either decided by margins of 10<br />points or more or went uncontested entirely. The<br />average margin of victory in the contested races<br />was 28 points. Only 36 races in 2022 were decided<br />by less than 5 points.Currently, the chamber<br />has 219 Republicans, 213 Democrats and three<br />vacancies, two of which were held by Republicans<br />and one by a Democrat. This means that, at full<br />maximization, the House balance would likely be<br />221-214. However, 11 seats are deemed toss-ups,<br />and numerous others are leaning towards either<br />party. Right now, it's 207 to 207 with 21 in<br />the air. I believe republicans have a slight<br />advantage.","Edward Tsui (43.5%): In São Paulo, Richard Nunes<br />is the incumbent. All ten rival candidates are<br />white, and only two are women. Mixed results in<br />polls. According to the Brazilian Report, roughly<br />29% of voters lean towards the left-leaning<br />workers party in comparison to 17% of the<br />Bolsonarism incumbent. However, in contrast,<br />26% of voters say they lean right in comparison<br />to the 20% that say they lean left. I believe<br />the incumbent has an advantage in this upcoming<br />election , but not by much. In reality, I would<br />call this election a toss-up before Sunday. As of<br />24 hours ago, Nunes has a 2% lead over Boulos. I<br />lowered my probability from 50-50 by 6.5% because<br />of Nunes advantage.","Jessica Armour (45%): based on my research, the<br />Republicans seem to have an advantage in the house<br />more so than the democratic party therefore, I<br />think it is less likely that the Democratic Party<br />will win a majority of seats","Abigail Harris (30%): All of the swing seats<br />in this election cycle for the House of<br />Representatives are currently blue. The incumbent<br />party is typically not favored in a swing seat<br />or an unsafe seat. There's all the question of it<br />being a presidential election year and more people<br />coming out to vote than usual.","Abigail Harris (30%): There have been repeated<br />instances of violence surrounding the elections.<br />From a thrown chair to a near clubbing it's an<br />interesting case. Marcal is dominating headlines<br />with the brash and violence but he's not a favored<br />candidate for mayor, instead a legislative seat<br />in 2026 because he's more popular with his base<br />than the larger population due in part to the<br />outlandish headlines he creates.","Jessica Armour (30%): the current major has been<br />reelected numerous times and is currently on his<br />third term. with that being said, i see it being<br />highly unlikely that a new mayor will replace his<br />considering how favored he is.","Shayna Van Glish (40%): Boulos currently appears<br />to have a higher probability of winning if his<br />momentum continues. However, incumbents like<br />Nunes tend to have a strong final push due to<br />established networks, resources, and visibility.<br />Therefore, the race is competitive, and while<br />Boulos is leading, the probability of Nunes<br />maintaining his position remains significant. This<br />is why I am giving it a 40% chance that there is a<br />new mayor after the elections.","Shayna Van Glish (55%): Democrats have a slight<br />edge, with about a 51% chance of winning a<br />majority, while Republicans have around a 49%<br />chance of retaining control. Currently, Democrats<br />are projected to win between 205 and 235 seats,<br />but there are many toss-up races that could swing<br />the final outcome either way​. That is why I am<br />putting my probability at a little higher than the<br />projected 51%.","Haley Ford (22%): -Incumbant advantage, party<br />popularity, pattern of incumbent reelection wins","Matthew Harvey (40%): This will probably be one<br />of my closest probabilities towards the middle.<br />This is due to the shear \"toss up\" regarding<br />the seats that are up for grabs right now in<br />the house. 47 seats are competitive and in those<br />competitive seats 24 dems are playing defense and<br />23 republicans are on defense. However these are<br />highly competitive and any slip-ups can change the<br />course of a campaign. Not to mention, republicans<br />already have a majority.","Leo Zegarra (50%): The truth is that it is quite<br />hard to predict which party will control more<br />seats between the two powerhouse parties. With the<br />Democrats facing challenges in swing districts and<br />Republicans benefiting from redistricting in some<br />states, it’s a close race. Polls and past trends<br />suggest the Democrats have a 45-50% chance of<br />regaining a majority. Factors like voter turnout<br />and economic conditions will play a crucial role.","Matthew Harvey (30%): The Sao Paulo mayoral<br />election is definitley an odd and strange one.<br />There are 4 strong candidates (including the<br />incumbent) who are vying for a strong majority.<br />However the incumbent is winning in recent polls<br />and those that are worried about the craziness of<br />the new candidates are likely to vote for what we<br />know.","Alex Vrolijk (45%): The democrats currently do not<br />hold the house and flipping seats is difficult.<br />A ~4+ seat gain would be needed for democrats<br />to gain control of the house. Projections have<br />also shown that republicans have a lead over the<br />democrats in odds to win the house this upcoming<br />November.","Haley Ford (61%): This is a a razor thin race,<br />with last election cycle showing how deeply<br />divided. However, it seems like the Democratic<br />Party is slightly more favored to flip the house.<br />(possibly senate goes to Red)","Findleigh Ague (70%): Whichever party receives<br />the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives,<br />they aren’t going to win by a huge margin. In<br />order for Democrats to win, they need a net gain<br />of four seats. This isn’t a huge task in order<br />to get rid of a weakly held Republican majority.<br />There are 22 races that are largely considered<br />to be toss-ups or swing districts, and 14 of them<br />are referred to as Democrat-leaning. Something to<br />consider as well is that undecided voters tend to<br />vote for change, meaning that many will probably<br />vote for the Democratic representatives for their<br />districts for a change in who has the majority.","Alex Vrolijk (75%): This is because Buous<br />is leading the current polls. Also, since no<br />candidate will reach 50% + 1 of the vote share it<br />will go into a runoff where Amaral's supporters<br />will move to support Buous. A combination of these<br />2 candidates nears 50% so I think Buos will beat<br />out the incumbent.","Findleigh Ague (70%): With a new front-running<br />candidate emerging, Pablo Marçal, and splitting<br />the right-wing votes, it looks as though Ricardo<br />Nunes might not be as close to a runoff after the<br />election as was initially thought. Marçal has a<br />lot of online traction and has really pushed his<br />campaigning, gaining the attention of right-wing<br />voters, so much so that in a recent poll, he had<br />received less votes than Guilherme Boulos, the<br />left-wing candidate, but more than Nunes, which<br />indicated for the first time that Nunes might<br />not even make it to the run off. With splitting<br />the right-wing votes, I think that it’s pretty<br />possible that Nunes does not get reelected for<br />mayor.","William Willis (40%): I gave the probability of 40<br />because I feel that the Democratic Party has been<br />loosing steam over the past couple of weeks. There<br />are some pivotal swing states and I feel like a<br />lot of these historically blue states, leaders<br />in the States are really anti democrat. With the<br />latest indictment of the NYC mayor it makes me<br />think that momentum is slowing for the party and<br />they will not make it happen.","William Willis (15%): I have the probability that<br />there will be a 15% probability of a new mayor.<br />The reason that I came up with this number is<br />because recent polling came out and Ricardo Nunes,<br />remains in the lead with 27% a few days before<br />the vote. It gives me confidence that he will be<br />selected because he took the place of the former<br />mayor and has done a good job for Brazil.","Kira Liscombe (5%): U.S. unemployment has been<br />on a slow rise this year, growing from 3.7% in<br />January to a last reported 4.2% in August. The<br />last time unemployment in the US reached above 5%<br />was in August of 2021. According to the U.S. Bureu<br />of Labor Statistics, states with statistically<br />significant unemployment rate changes from July<br />2024 to August 2024 only saw as high as a 0.4%<br />change, which occurred in South Carolina. Overall,<br />there were only 4 states with unemployment rates<br />significantly different from that of the U.S.<br />that fell over 5%. Even though we have seen a<br />climb in unemployment this year, the rate remains<br />relatively low by historical standards and it is<br />very unlikely to see rapid enough growth over the<br />next two months so that it reaches above 5%.","Erin Ho (15%): Looking at this year’s unemployment<br />rate, the highest the unemployment rate reached<br />was 4.3% and based on other predictions online,<br />will remain on the lower side for the rest of<br />the year. Things that currently influence the<br />unemployment rate is temporary layoffs (different<br />from permanent layoffs) and new labor force<br />entrants. Temporary layoffs allow companies to cut<br />costs without permanently losing their employees,<br />and labor force entrants are people entering the<br />labor force for the first time, so this could be<br />teenagers or freshly graduated college students.","Ryan Foley (40%): The Bureau of Labor Statistics<br />released August's unemployment rate with it<br />sitting at 4.2%. This is a slight bump from<br />this time last year when the unemployment rate<br />was at 3.8%. Google's statistics show that we<br />are on a very slight rise in unemployment since<br />2022, however the last time we were at over 5%<br />unemployment was August 2021. This was when the<br />US was still returning from the COVID-19 pandemic<br />and many Americans were returning to work. With<br />the recent rate cut, unemployment could tick<br />up slightly but I doubt it will hit 5%. With<br />the election coming up as well, unless Kamala<br />introduces drastic changes to the economy there<br />shouldn't be too huge of changes to unemployment<br />rates.","Victor Avila (15%): I think there is a 15%<br />probability that the US unemployment rate will<br />rise above 5% by December 1st. Just recently,<br />the United States unemployment rate fell to 4.2%<br />from 4.3% in September according to the bureau<br />of labor statistics, which was below economists’<br />expectations due to adding 142,000 jobs in August.<br />So this recent fall in unemployment mixed with the<br />recent ½ percent rate cut by the Fed (which will<br />lead to more investment and hiring) gives a slim<br />chance to the unemployment rate rising above 5% by<br />December.","Simon Gersten (24%): According to the federal<br />reserve, the U.S. is likely to remain well below<br />the 5% threshold. The current estimation is that<br />it will remain below 4.5%. Given that there are<br />no foreseeable collapses of the economy yet,<br />unemployment is likely to remain below 5%. This<br />could change, however, with rising tensions in the<br />Middle East and strikes in ports along the east<br />coast.","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): The unemployment rate<br />has changed little in the past few months, however<br />strikes from dock workers threaten the economy.","Haley Ford (10%): Although a rising unemployment<br />rate is likely, above 5% indicates rapid change.<br />Right now economists are noticing a \"softening\"<br />of the economy - but indicate it doesn't represent<br />a recession. Additionally, the interest rate<br />cuts from the Fed could help prevent further<br />unemployment, although it will take time to see<br />the effects of the reduction.","Abby Crowe (3%): I give a 3% chance that the<br />unemployment rate will raise above 5%. From what<br />I can tell, the job market has been relatively<br />stable, only fluctuating about a tenth or so<br />from the current rate (4.2%) for the past couple<br />of years. Long term predictions only predict<br />minor movement. Additionally, the Fed cutting<br />interest rates should theoretically help to reduce<br />unemployment, and that will begin to show in the<br />next couple of months.","David Daniels (12%): The likelihood of the<br />unemployment rate surging above 5% is highly<br />improbable. Currently, the unemployment rate<br />is at 4.2%, and it is not projected to increase<br />significantly, especially in such a short time<br />span such as December. My reasoning for this<br />probability is also supported by the Federal<br />Reserve cutting rates. These reasons consider I<br />assign a 12% probability.","Brooke Mcdermott (25%): I don't see the<br />unemployment rate rising above 5%. I saw that<br />there have been less unemployment insurance claims<br />since the beginning of this year, and they are<br />steadily decreasing. However, CNN reported that<br />unemployment generally tends to increase by a<br />percentage point by the following year.","Shayna Van Glish (15%): As of August 2024, the<br />U.S. unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, reflecting<br />a modest increase from previous months. While<br />job growth has slowed, particularly in sectors<br />like healthcare and construction, forecasts<br />from financial analysts and institutions such<br />as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan suggest that the<br />unemployment rate may edge slightly higher in the<br />coming months. However, it is not expected to rise<br />above 5% before December 2024, barring any major<br />economic disruptions.","Alexis Frazer (15%): As of August, the<br />unemployment rate was a 4.2 and based off of<br />trends over the past 2 years, rates do not tend<br />to fluctuate by .8 in a span of two months. There<br />are many outside effects that could impact the<br />unemployment rate, and immigration is believed to<br />be the driving factor of the currently increasing<br />unemployment rate, but the probability for it to<br />surge in the next two months is improbable.","Corinne O'Dell (18%): It is unlikely that the<br />U.S. unemployment rate will rise above 5% before<br />December 1, 2024. Current forecasts suggest the<br />rate will reach around 4.7% by the end of the<br />year, reflecting gradual job market softening. The<br />Federal Reserve and other projections anticipate<br />that while the labor market may continue to<br />weaken, the unemployment rate is not expected to<br />exceed 5% in the near term unless a significant<br />economic disruption occurs.","Ladi Fashogbon (28%): n August 2024 was around<br />3.8%, slightly higher than its historic lows<br />earlier in the year. A gradual rise has been<br />observed, but the rate is still well below 5. What<br />i researched led me to believe that the rate would<br />be less than 30 for this being otherwise, but not<br />as low as 25.","Vikram Bharadwaj (15%): Currently with<br />unemployment rate at what its at, it is extremely<br />improbable that we would reach such a high<br />unemployment rate so soon. Currently with a 4.2%<br />at August, it would be historic for it to rise<br />.8 in just 3 total months, as even a .2 increase<br />in one month would be insanely high. Looking at<br />projection by investment firms such as vanguard,<br />they project it to \"marginally (be) above current<br />levels,\" and I'm guessing that a multi-billion<br />dollar investment management group would have some<br />sort of a good read at this. On top of that, with<br />the current rate cuts, would generally indicate<br />that unemployment should decrease if anything, as<br />long as the market stays roughly the same (please<br />no wwIII I beg of the.)","Colin Barry (10%): The US unemployment rate is<br />currently 4.2%, and recently held its longest<br />streak of being under 4% since the Vietnam War.<br />This indicates that it is unlikely for such<br />a drastic turn to cause the unemployment rate<br />to rise so drastically. The unemployment rate<br />forecasted to remain in the range of 3.7% and the<br />current 4.2% for the next couple of years until<br />2027. For this reason I think there is a 10%<br />chance it increases above 5%.","Minha Ahmad (20%): Currently the U.S. unemployment<br />rate is 4.3% and it is not expected to change by<br />December. According to the Washington Post, the<br />unemployment rate reached to 4.3% in August of<br />this year, and was at 3.4% in April 2023. Although<br />this is a big jump, this increase of point nine<br />percent occurred in a year and three months time.<br />Another jump of point seven percent in three<br />months time until December is highly unlikely.","Hayden Morehouse (20%): See Briefing","Liv Payne (15%): It seems pretty unlikely that<br />employment is going to rise from 4.2% (the current<br />rate) to 5% in two months (a 0.8% increase when<br />the current trend is about 0.1% a month, with<br />some 0.1% decrease). Even though unemployment has<br />been gradually increasing, the 0.8% increase is<br />too high of a jump without some factor beyond the<br />usual patterns (such as temporary unemployment).<br />Economics are also saying that we are not seeing<br />the indications of a recession *beyond* this<br />unemployment increase (see Sahm Rule), therefore a<br />recession is unlikely.","Rommy Etzion (20%): The unemployment rate has been<br />recently stable between 4.1-4.3% in recent months<br />and has been consistently below 5% not including<br />the COVID spike. The rate has been on a downward<br />slope (not including the pandemic), and there<br />are no currently foreseeable factors indicating<br />a major change in the trajectory. The GDP growth<br />rate has been exceeding 2.5% for the past year and<br />inflation has been decreasing alongside relatively<br />low unemployment. Consumer unit expenditures have<br />been increasing, and personal consumption has<br />also been increasing slightly. And an increase of<br />0.8% in 2 months is a significant jump in a short<br />period of time.","John Mathis (8%): For Unemployment to reach 5% by<br />December, there would have to be a .8% increase<br />over 2 months. This has happened before, but only<br />in the midst of severe recession, which we are not<br />currently in. So unless there is an unprecedented<br />pandemic or housing crash within the next<br />month-ish (labor statistics have about a month of<br />delay to publish), we will not see unemployment<br />rate above 5% on dec. 1","Matthew Harvey (15%): In this short amount of<br />time. I don't believe that the unemployment rate<br />will rise above the 5% given in the probability<br />question. This is due to a couple of factors. For<br />one, unemployment rate right now is at 4.2%. Two,<br />the fed cutting rates will help with the rate. We<br />haven't seen the impact of that yet.","Jessica Armour (36%): Based on statistics posted<br />within Trading Economics and Statistica, the<br />unemployment rate has spiked since March of 2024,<br />and is currently at 4.2% as of August 2024. With<br />that being said, unemployment rate is expected to<br />rise to at least 4.6% due to financial constraints<br />and increased interest rates. Along with this,<br />it is important to consider that financial<br />constraints get significantly more intense at the<br />end of the year due to the holidays, which is a<br />time of year in which layoffs are significantly<br />common. However, as of right now, I would say it<br />is probably unlikely that unemployment rate will<br />be more than 5% by the end of the year due to the<br />downward trend we are currently experiencing.","Alex Vrolijk (15%): August 2024 unemployment rate<br />is 4.2% and has been growing steadily. Despite the<br />current growth I do not expect it to surpass 5%<br />by December 1st. The Fed is also lowering interest<br />rates which should also help reduce unemployment.<br />Unless any major unexpected events occur, I do not<br />believe unemployment will rise above 5%.","Findleigh Ague (10%): Though the unemployment<br />rate right now isn’t insanely far from 5%, and it<br />had increased since 2023, I think that it would<br />take something pretty drastic for it to ride all<br />the way to 5%. I’ve also seen multiple forecasts<br />predicting the rate to remain below 4.5% for the<br />next few years, so I don’t think that it will rise<br />before the end of this one.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (14%): Some economic<br />models predict that the unemployment rate will<br />increase to 4.5% next year. The job market is<br />currently strong. Sudden changes are not as<br />common. I also observed in graphs that in the past<br />5 years, the unemployment rate decreased around<br />Nov-Dec/stayed constant. Sudden changes occurred<br />more over the summer or after the beginning of<br />the year. With the cut of interest rates this past<br />month, I think that will further stimulate the<br />job market in the right direction (praying for my<br />brier score).","Leo Zegarra (16%): I gave this question a 16%<br />chance of happening. This is mainly due to the<br />current economic indicators, such as stable<br />consumer spending and solid job growth, which<br />are making a sharp rise in unemployment unlikely.<br />The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies, aiming<br />to balance inflation without derailing the job<br />market, also play a crucial role in limiting<br />the likelihood of a sudden spike, so I gave it<br />a relatively low chance for the couple of months<br />left in the timeline.","Carson Ankeny (40%): Unemployment is slowly rising<br />currently and is around 4%. There is a chance that<br />this slow rise will result in it going over 5%,<br />as well as a chance that it will stay just below<br />5%. However, due to the way these statistics are<br />gathered and the relatively late release of jobs<br />reports, there isn’t a lot of time for this to<br />happen.","Gracie Culpepper (19%): Although the unemployment<br />rate is rising and has been for the past few<br />months, it is currently only sitting at 4.3%.<br />That's a lot more people that would need to<br />become unemployed before the start of December.<br />Even with the hurricane and people possibly being<br />displaced/jobless due to the damage, I still think<br />jobs and work will be needed to repair surrounding<br />communities and will make up for the unemployment<br />deficit it may cause.","Reece Slater (0%): No chance it rises above 5%<br />by Dec 1. Almost every database or forecast I<br />have seen has the 2024 rate at around 3.7-4.5%.<br />I also found a forecast model that gave it around<br />a 4% chance for the unemployment rate to be from<br />4.9-5.4%. Right now it is around 4.2%, and I don't<br />see it rising to 5% in two months.","Edward Tsui (28%): Trading economics forecasts<br />December 2024 to have an unemployment rate of<br />4.4%. I do not think the unemployment rate will<br />sky rocket 0.8 in about two months. Furthermore,<br />the rate just recently went down since August<br />2024, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics has a<br />meeting on Friday to update the status. Other<br />sources like Statista predict anywhere from<br />4.4-4.7 % by December.","Sara Whitmire (20%): According to the Bureau<br />of Labor Statistics, as of August 2024, the<br />unemployment rate is about 4.2%, and a year before<br />it was 3.8%; a sudden jump by .8 points to a 5%<br />rate between now and December seems unlikely. The<br />Fed interest rate adjustments in recent months<br />will likely have a positive impact on unemployment<br />rates.","Franco Bravo (20%): I believe that the<br />unemployment rate will remain under 5 percent. One<br />of the reasons I believe so is because ive read<br />that the overall prediction for the end of the<br />year is for it to be at 4.4 and unless something<br />drastic happens in the economy, I believe it will<br />remain lower than 5","Colin Barry (60%): Georgia's State Election Board<br />has just approved a new rule that would require<br />this hand-counting of ballots. State officials and<br />members of the Democratic Party have been pushing<br />back on this, however, as this process would be<br />tedious and is hard to implement this close to<br />the election. A court hearing is scheduled for the<br />near future to weigh the lawfulness of the rule,<br />which is why I have the chance so low.","Alex Vrolijk (45%): Although Georgia hand counting<br />ballots is now technically a law that will remain<br />in effect for the election, Democrats have begun<br />a lawsuit that could overturn it. The Georgia<br />Elections Board Chairman also states how they<br />are not a legislative body and that a lawsuit<br />could easily shoot down hand counting ballots.<br />Despite the chairman's statements, I would not<br />be surprised if a court does not overturn the law<br />even with an incoming lawsuit.","Jessica Armour (65%): The rule to hand-count polls<br />was already passed Sept 20. However, three days<br />ago a lawsuit was filed stating that this rule<br />was unproductive and unconstitutional. With that<br />being said, considering the rule is already been<br />passed it is up to the swiftness of the Court<br />to determine whether or not it actually happens.<br />Along with this, the Secretary of State even<br />mentions his distaste for hand-counting polls.<br />However, several other states have also made last<br />minute changes to their voting methods, so Georgia<br />isn't the only one radically changing something.<br />I would say that unless new information comes out<br />from the Court it is more likely to happen because<br />it has already been passed.","Gracie Culpepper (62%): I think this election is<br />going to be very close, and with GA being a major<br />swing state, I think if this election is close by<br />any means one of the candidates will call for a<br />recount of the votes.","Hayden Morehouse (75%): I mainly put a high<br />percentage here because of all the commotion that<br />happened last year in regards to the voting count.<br />I also am thinking this will be a close election<br />with the swing states playing an important factor<br />and they will want to be precise.","Minha Ahmad (80%): Less than two weeks ago, the<br />Georgia election board voted to require ballots<br />to be hand counted in anticipation of the upcoming<br />election. I think that it is not likely so soon<br />to the election that this decision would be<br />overturned.","Vikram Bharadwaj (55%): I think if we look<br />further into this question, it becomes harder<br />to say whether or not this will occur. Given<br />that the Judge may have been swayed regarding<br />this question, it becomes increasingly difficult<br />to guess whether or not he will even place an<br />injunction. I think that in general this is<br />an extremely difficult question to gauge given<br />how disliked the election board's decision is<br />contrasted with the fact that they do seem to<br />be committed to making the deadline. While this<br />judge may have been the one to throw out Georgia's<br />abortion law, it is exceedingly likely that an<br />upper court will simply overrule that decision.","Kira Liscombe (72%): On Sept 20th, PBS News<br />Reported that Georgia’s State Election Board<br />voted to approve a new rule that requires poll<br />workers to count the number of paper ballots<br />by hand after voting is completed. Already, two<br />rules the board passed last month having to do<br />with certifying vote counts have been challenged<br />in two separate lawsuits. The rule was met with<br />criticism from experts and non-partisan officials<br />across Georgia. Three days ago, National and<br />Georgia state Democrats filed to block the rule.<br />They believe that this rule is unproductive and<br />unlawful. Supporters of the rule say it will<br />increase public trust in elections by making them<br />more transparent. Its a very divided issue, so<br />im not sure if the lawsuit will prohibit the rule<br />in time, so i give it an above medium chance of<br />occurring.","David Daniels (60%): I see two different<br />situations where this could happen. First, there<br />could be a state-mandated recount requested by<br />either campaign, or the ruling initiated by the<br />State Election Board (SEB) is upheld. Currently,<br />Trump is leading the polls in Georgia by a margin<br />slightly above the 0.5% required for a recount,<br />but things can change between now and November<br />5th. Secondly, I think it's somewhat likely,<br />but not guaranteed, that the Superior Court in<br />Atlanta might injunction this rule or strike it<br />completely. The information I have found regarding<br />this matter is split among legal scholars, with<br />no conclusive opinion prevailing. I think there<br />are more scenarios that result in a recount than<br />those that don't, which is why I believe there's<br />a 60% probability of hand-counted ballots. I would<br />say my nightmare scenario is if Trump wins Georgia<br />by a considerable margin and the Superior Court<br />of Atlanta rules in against the SEB ruling . This<br />effectively would null any changes of hand-counted<br />ballots.","Liv Payne (15%): The GA election board recently<br />past a string of rules regarding the upcoming<br />presidential election. One such rule, passed 3-2<br />by Trump-supported (he actually called them \"pit<br />bulls\", I am not making this up) Republicans,<br />requires 3 people to hand count ballots, and<br />their numbers must align with one another and a<br />counting machine (it is important to note they are<br />not counting votes, but the ballots themselves).<br />However, according to a pending lawsuit (from<br />Democrats AND Republicans), these rules violate<br />GA law and ovedrstep their authority. GA Attorney<br />General Chris Carr warned the election board that<br />state legislature had not legally authoprized the<br />board to pass these rule, but he was ignored. The<br />trial started this Tuesday, going before Judge<br />Robert McBurney. Thus far, McBurney has said that<br />these rules need review, and it is concerning how<br />many new rules the Board is pushing through last<br />minute. It seems as though McBurney agrees with<br />the plaintiffs and will overturn the new rules,<br />but an article by CNN notes that, no matter the<br />result, there will likely be an appeal from the<br />losing side. Time is not on anyone's side here, as<br />the election is weeks away. I put my probability<br />low, but I would like to keep an eye on this case<br />as it works its way through the court system.","Jeffrey Markowitz (75%): The measure was already<br />approved by the georgia state election board.","Erin Ho (45%): In late September of this year,<br />the Georgia State Election Board passed a law<br />that required Georgia Precincts to hand count<br />ballots for elections. Now that I’m writing out<br />my thoughts, I think it’ll get removed because<br />there’s far more human error when it comes to<br />hand counting. Not only does it take so much<br />longer, but if there’s any mess ups, it causes<br />more stress, and we must start over. What’s more,<br />there’s a deadline the count has to be finished<br />by, and it will only cause more chaos during the<br />elections.","Edward Tsui (55%): Based on what I've seen, I<br />think this situation could go 50-50. However,<br />I have a slight lean to the fact given the<br />certification situation from 4 years ago with<br />Trump and Kemp; I believe the 3 board of elections<br />members will get there way. I believe Judge<br />Robert McBurney in Fulton may strike it based on<br />legality, but his recent comments that were quoted<br />on the Hill did not seem positively in favor of<br />that.","Leo Zegarra (83%): I believe there's a high<br />chance that poll workers in Georgia will be<br />required to hand-count paper ballots after voting<br />this November. This mostly stems from a recent<br />mandate by the State Election Board. While legal<br />challenges might surface, the prevailing sentiment<br />is that the requirement will likely stay in place,<br />ensuring transparency in the electoral process.<br />Many voters and advocates support this initiative,<br />believing it enhances trust in the election<br />results. Overall, it seems voters can expect this<br />hand-counting process to proceed as planned.","Alexis Frazer (60%): Early voting in Georgia<br />starts on October 15. The earliest possible date<br />new rules could take effect if passed is October<br />14, which is just 22 days before the General<br />Election. The courts seem to be going back and<br />forth on this decision. Kemp refused a recount in<br />2020 so perhaps if they count by hand they will be<br />exempt from having to do a recount.","Sara Whitmire (65%): If hand-counting ballots is<br />required, I believe it will be because of a close<br />race; as a swing state, Georgia’s votes are likely<br />to be close enough to warrant a hand-counting of<br />votes to avoid the \"stealing the election!!1!!\"<br />headache that happened last election cycle. In<br />2020, the vote came down to 11,700 votes and<br />a hand-counting was called for by the Georgia<br />Secretary of State. Hand-counting is an incredibly<br />difficult and inefficient process, given the size<br />of today’s electorate, but I believe a recount of<br />some sort will be called for due to the precedent<br />set by the 2020 election. Further historical<br />precedent would be the election between George<br />W Bush and Al Gore, where the votes came down<br />to a matter of thousands. In their Bush v. Gore<br />decision, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld<br />the final ballot count by the 3rd or 4th round<br />of double-checking, as the inauguration date<br />was coming up and a decision had to be made. I<br />anticipate something along these lines happening<br />again, as Trump will likely call for multiple<br />recounts.","William Willis (55%): I gave this answer at 55%<br />probability of happening. I tried to apply what we<br />learned in the last chapter we read and take each<br />information bit by bit. I had a lot of trouble<br />picking a number for this. I feel like hand<br />picking won't making much of a difference. The<br />only thing that they should be doing is requiring<br />an id for voting to ensure for legitimate results.<br />But the fact that this is going to the legal<br />system and Georgia had so much backlash for fraud<br />votes last election I feel that they will take<br />extreme measures to count votes.","John Mathis (35%): As of yesterday, the ACLU<br />is suing the state of Georgia along with a slew<br />of other organizations.Furthermore, Law experts<br />with Propublica found that the changes are<br />less complaint with the law than a previously<br />introduced rule, which was voted down because,<br />believe it or not, it did not follow state and<br />federal election laws. The reason I hedge at 35<br />is because there is still a slight chance that<br />republican appointed judges in the state could<br />just ignore the actual letter of the law to make a<br />ruling.","Matthew Harvey (30%): I believe that ever since<br />the election board approved the hand counting of<br />ballots, everyone has considered the ramifications<br />it would have on elections in the state. This is<br />a means of holding up elections and postponing<br />calling the election. There are many precedents<br />before this that have nullified this new rule. i<br />believe this will be overturned.","Reece Slater (70%): Obviously, this all rides<br />on if the new Georgia voting law gets upheld or<br />struck down in court. I did a bit of research<br />on the judge presiding over the case, and he<br />is sending some mixed signals I think. His main<br />priority is election certification being on time<br />and not delayed, and this rule could possibly<br />lengthen the results. I think he might rule that<br />as long as certification is on time, poll workers<br />can count votes however they'd like.","Findleigh Ague (15%): There is a new requirement<br />for poll workers at Georgia precincts to hand<br />count each paper ballot to ensure that the amount<br />of physical ballots matches the amount digitally<br />scanned. Though this was technically made a<br />requirement, it has received a lot of backlash,<br />including legal action, because of its likely<br />ineffectiveness and unlawfulness. I don't think<br />that it will be actually set into place before the<br />election, considering it is just a month away, and<br />it honestly just really doesn't make any sense,<br />as it will likely cause errors and delay election<br />results and put a lot of pressure on poll workers.","Haley Ford (23%): It does not seem like it will<br />be able to occur before election time, especially<br />since ballot printing and poll worker training has<br />already commenced.

It<br />shows some weakness in their military strength and<br />risk in trying to keep the Russian territory. With<br />the possibility of more Russian counterattacks<br />and Ukraine’s limited military capabilities, they<br />might not be able to hold onto it if they want to<br />protect their own land.","Kira Liscombe (77%): By 2024, Western intelligence<br />officials estimated that the Russo-Ukranian<br />war had set back Russia’s attempts at military<br />modernization by nearly two full decades. As of<br />August 2024, Ukrainians are taking and holding<br />Russian land, and Russians are pushing in the<br />east. Ukraine's foreign ministry says it is not<br />interested in \"taking territory\" in the region,<br />but will continue its offensive until Russia<br />agrees to \"a just peace\". Western intelligence<br />sources think it could be a question of who<br />withdraws their forces first. Additionally,<br />Ukrainian military analyst Mykhailo Samus assessed<br />that Moscow would need in the realm of 50,000<br />troops, to fully retake the areas Ukraine now<br />controls, and that’s not a force Russia seems<br />eager to commit. Last week, Ukraine presented<br />their \"victory plan\" to the US, but there was<br />not much eagerness in response. The answer to<br />this depends on aid, a possible NATO invitation,<br />and ceasefire negotiations, but with Mid Eastern<br />conflict and the US Elelection holding the<br />spotlight, i find it unlikely that Ukrainian<br />military forces will leave Russia before Dec 1.","Ryan Foley (60%): Ukraine has been making<br />important advances into Russian territory over<br />the past couple of weeks. With the war continuing<br />to creep on, Russia has suffered a far greater<br />proportion of losses compared to Ukraine and it<br />shows in their abilities to continue to fight.<br />Ukraine has also been using drones to strike<br />further into Russian territory, most notably<br />destroying an ammo depot inside of Russia. So long<br />as the US continues to supply Ukraine with the<br />equipment needed to maintain their position, I<br />don't see Ukraine backing out of Russia. However,<br />with Republican support for Ukraine dwindling,<br />they could easily fall behind and allow Russia to<br />retake land.","Colin Barry (60%): The Ukranian troops that have<br />captured a piece of the Kursk region have done so<br />to attempt to relieve some of the pressure on the<br />eastern front. Russia has pressed on however, and<br />seem seemingly is in no rush to push them out. I<br />see this occupation as more of bargaining chip,<br />and with no peace talks in sight ahead of December<br />1st, I think it's more likely than not they are<br />still there.","Alex Vrolijk (70%): Zelenskyy has stated his<br />intention to establish a command office in<br />the Ukrainian-controlled territory of Sudzha.<br />Zelenskyy claims this will help defend eastern<br />Ukraine so I hope any Russian pressure will not<br />result in an immediate Ukrainian withdrawal. With<br />Russian pressure yet to challenge Ukranian troops<br />for the past 2 months, I am hopeful they won't<br />levy any serious pressure until after Dec. 1'st<br />as they still seem to be focusing on Ukraine's<br />southeastern front.","Simon Gersten (85%): The arrival of winter will<br />likely freeze territorial advances on both sides.<br />In addition, international support for Ukraine<br />remains high, which shows that Ukraine will likely<br />not be pushed back further in the foreseeable<br />future.","Jessica Armour (75%): Ukrainian military forces<br />have been occupying parts of Russia since very<br />early August. With that being said, the Russian<br />military has been unsuccessful in removing them.<br />Along with this, although there has been some<br />Russian troops deployed there has still been<br />no give from the Ukrainian troops. Therefore,<br />more than likely they will remain in Russian<br />territories.","Gracie Culpepper (86%): Funding will be decided<br />after the inauguration of the next president. Most<br />plans have been announced to occur in 2025, and<br />I highly doubt there will be enough time left to<br />push them out completely.","Hayden Morehouse (80%): The Ukrainian forces seem<br />to be stationed there for the time being with no<br />real intent on leaving currently. War moves slow<br />and even for them to fully evacuate the area would<br />take a large amount of time. I do worry about the<br />russian winter for the troops however so we will<br />see how that plays out.","Minha Ahmad (67%): I would say that the war<br />between Russia and Ukraine is not likely to end<br />by December and due to the fact that Ukraine has<br />consistent backing from major countries like the<br />United States, their forces will note exit Russia<br />by December 1st.","Vikram Bharadwaj (90%): There does not seem<br />to be any major reason for Ukraine to not<br />only relinquish control of their holdings in<br />Russia, or do anything other than just try and<br />weather the storm. Realistically, there will<br />not be a ceasefire, but I feel like there is a<br />significant enough chance that Russia launches<br />a counter-offensive that could push Ukraine out.<br />But given how Russia seems to have turned towards<br />a more bombardment aproach, I doubt any troop<br />movements would be made against the Ukrainian<br />holdings in Russia.","David Daniels (85%): With Russia recently<br />capturing Vuhledar, it seems unlikely that they<br />will leave Ukraine. Ukrainian forces won't give<br />up the little land they hold in Russia. Currently,<br />there appears to be a standstill on the Ukrainian<br />military side. I haven't heard any recent<br />news about Ukraine deciding to leave either.<br />Considering these reasons, I don't see Ukraine<br />leaving Russia anytime soon. Therefore, I assign<br />an 85% probability.","Alexis Frazer (65%): Ukraine's counteroffensives<br />have aimed to reclaim territory, and occasional<br />incursions into Russian border regions, such as<br />Belgorod, have been reported. These actions serve<br />to disrupt Russian military operations, secure<br />tactical advantages, and put pressure on Moscow.<br />Additionally, the fluid nature of the conflict,<br />with shifting frontlines and protracted fighting,<br />makes it plausible that Ukrainian forces could<br />maintain a foothold in contested areas by that<br />time.","Brooke Mcdermott (65%): The action of invading<br />Russia in August was extremely audacious for<br />Ukraine, especially because they lost some<br />vulnerable areas of Ukraine to reallocate soldiers<br />for the invasion. I think the intensity of the<br />decision demonstrates an intention to occupy for<br />as long as necessary.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (78%): I think this is<br />a difficult question. First, by Russian territory<br />are we referring to Russian-claimed territory? Or<br />the region of Kursk? I’m not sure how the winter<br />may affect war, but I think it may have an effect.<br />Ukraine has an overwhelming amount of support<br />from the West, and I think this will help them<br />still keep control of that territory. Russia is<br />focusing their resources in the east side of the<br />war and not Kursk. Russian media states (don’t<br />know how reliable this source is) that Russia<br />must sacrifice some things (in this case Kursk)<br />and focus on the greater good. My guess is that<br />Ukraine will be able to hold on to that territory<br />until the end of the year. Zelensky is focusing<br />his attention and resources to that area a lot<br />more and Putin has largely ignored these advances.","Liv Payne (80%): This feels quite related to<br />our ceasfire question from a few weeks back. It<br />seems little has changed beyond the two countries<br />exchanging blows (Ukraine stole another tank, so<br />that's cool). They did lose Vuhledar, which might<br />shake them. The election is also looming near, and<br />Trump has said he will pull the US out of Ukraine.<br />In my opinion, this would be a killing blow for<br />the small country, as they rely heavily upon US<br />support in this invasion. So ultimately, I believe<br />that Ukraine is going to hold out for as long as<br />possible, and it would not be them withdrawing<br />from Russian territory as much as being overrun.","Edward Tsui (80%): According to BBC, Trump wants<br />to end the Russian-Ukraine conflict as soon<br />as possible per a meeting with Zelensky that<br />happened recently. I do not think the conflict<br />will be resolved with a Biden re-election , at<br />least anytime soon. If it were to be resolved<br />with a ceasefire agreement, it would be under<br />a Trump victory come November 5th. Even then,<br />his inauguration is in January, and I think he<br />would wait until he seized control so he could<br />take credit for the ceasefire. Per our previous<br />forecast, the crowd forecast for a ceasefire come<br />December 1st was 20%, and I think a relinquish<br />of Russian territory back to Russia would take a<br />Ukrainian total loss or a Ukrainian leverage.","Victor Avila (80%): When finding the probability<br />of this, I asked myself the questions: what would<br />require the Ukrainian military forces to leave the<br />occupied Russian territory in the Kursk region?<br />The answer to this I found would most likely be a<br />Russian invasion to take it back, or a diplomatic<br />end to the war which would remove the troops and<br />give the land back to Russia presumeably. Putin<br />stated in August that they would take the region<br />back in a \"timely\" manner. As troops continue<br />to focus in eastern Ukraine I find this highly<br />unlikely. The answer to the other question I find<br />less likely as Biden recently approved the use<br />of long range missiles which would escalate the<br />conflict to a wider war with Nato.","Jeffrey Markowitz (70%): Ukranian forces are<br />resilient and ceasefire agreements show no sign of<br />happening.","Leo Zegarra (65%): My probability reflects<br />the current stability of Ukrainian forces<br />in Russian-occupied territories amid ongoing<br />military engagements. Despite Ukraine's<br />operational successes, the unpredictable nature<br />of the conflict, including potential Russian<br />counteroffensives, leaves some uncertainty.<br />Continued carefulness from both sides suggests a<br />significant likelihood of Ukrainian presence until<br />December 1.","Abigail Harris (65%): When in doubt I find I give<br />more leniency to the status quo. If it’s unclear<br />what exactly is going to happen it’s also up in<br />the air if anything will happen at all. For the<br />requirements of this happening, it mostly hinges<br />on continued international backing for Ukraine<br />which is widely popular. Many European countries<br />have agreed to multi year funding and the United<br />States is tied into significant ongoing financial<br />assistance. Alternative evidence includes the<br />Presidential election, particularly with a Donald<br />Trump win, saying our support or the military<br />capabilities of Ukraine on the ground being<br />limited by personnel shortages and logistics with<br />equipment constraints.","Franco Bravo (35%): Due to ukraines push into<br />Russian territory, I believe that Russia will<br />be looking for any sort of counter attack and<br />also will not accept losing land in the long<br />run. Additionally, I feel like Ukraine is not<br />looking to gain lands, rather keep the lands they<br />previously held","William Willis (40%): I have come up with the<br />probability that there will be a a 40% chance that<br />Ukrainian forces occupy Russia. I read an article<br />saying that Russia forces are in every part of the<br />city in Ukraine. Russia has been finding gaps in<br />the Ukrainian military and taking them. The war<br />has been going on. I found that Ukraine has been<br />developing new drones to deploy. That makes me<br />think that they are worried about having people<br />fighting but are looking at other options.","John Mathis (65%): From what Ive found, Putin is<br />far more focused on making n roads into Ukrainian<br />territory rather than focusing on the small bit<br />of Russian territory occupied by Ukraine. This<br />would make strategic sense since they are trying<br />to push far enough in on the weakened eastern<br />front in order to entice them back to the line out<br />of Russian territory. IF they make a large enough<br />push into Ukrainian territory, it might prompt<br />a retreat from Russian territory, so I hedged my<br />bets a little. There is not a ton of up to date<br />information, which also lowers the confidence of<br />my prediction.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): I am predicting a 75%<br />chance that Ukrainian forces will still occupy<br />Russian territory by December 1 due to Ukraine's<br />ongoing offensive success and Russia's military<br />challenges. Ukraine's strategic advances,<br />backed by strong international support, make it<br />likely they will hold onto gains. Additionally,<br />Russian forces have struggled with logistics and<br />morale, reducing the probability of a successful<br />counterattack.","Reece Slater (65%): As of now, Ukrainian forces<br />still control a large area of land in the Kursk<br />region. Putin previously placed a deadline on<br />pushing these forces out by October 1, and that<br />has not happened as of yet. I think some forces<br />have been removed, but not a substantial amount.<br />The only outcome I see as plausible is if Ukraine<br />pulls their forces out of the region in order to<br />better defend their homeland, as their troops are<br />currently stretched thin.","Ladi Fashogbon (12%): No western aid, the conflict<br />is more about pushing back Russian forces rather<br />than occupying Russian soil​( IISS), Military<br />constraints, Global pressures.","Matthew Harvey (80%): The Russia-Ukrainian<br />Conflict is one that has many issues surrounding<br />territory gained. While I do acknowledge the<br />conflict going on and the issues surrounding it,<br />I believe this is a difficult one to predict.<br />However I don't forsee Ukraine being able to move<br />out of Russian Territory this quickly with so<br />little time until our deadline. It took the United<br />States months to get out of Afghanistan, and this<br />is without them seizing any of US territories.","Haley Ford (39%): I does not seem likely that<br />they will be able to hold the territory for long,<br />especially since it seems like it was more to<br />create a dilemma for Putin than keep that part<br />of Russia. Also, Ukraine is diverting their own<br />experienced troops to Kursk while still having to<br />defend their own borders.","Carson Ankeny (85%): There is simply no reason<br />for them to withdraw. There is not enough existing<br />pressure to get them to seek peace or withdraw<br />troops, and no realistic path towards such an<br />outcome. The only way there wouldn’t be troops<br />would be total Russian defeat which seems highly<br />unlikely."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,5.5999999999999996],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,5.5999999999999996],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will poll workers at<br />Georgia precincts be<br />required to hand-count<br />paper ballots after<br />voting is completed in<br />November?","Will the Democratic<br />Party win a majority of<br />seats in the US House<br />of Representatives in<br />November?","Will the US unemployment<br />rate rise above 5% before<br />December 1?","Will there be a new<br />Mayor in São Paulo after<br />this year's Brazilian<br />municipal elections?","Will Ukrainian military<br />forces still occupy<br />Russian territory on<br />December 1?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3,4,5],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will poll workers at<br />Georgia precincts be<br />required to hand-count<br />paper ballots after<br />voting is completed in<br />November?","Will the Democratic<br />Party win a majority of<br />seats in the US House<br />of Representatives in<br />November?","Will the US unemployment<br />rate rise above 5% before<br />December 1?","Will there be a new<br />Mayor in São Paulo after<br />this year's Brazilian<br />municipal elections?","Will Ukrainian military<br />forces still occupy<br />Russian territory on<br />December 1?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"12702e6a38de":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"127070894ce1":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"12702e6a38de","visdat":{"12702e6a38de":["function (y) ","x"],"127070894ce1":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Partly<br />this is an issue of time frame---you don't mount<br />a *secret* major amphibious invasion in 2024<br />without the world knowing about it two months<br />in advance. (Russia's mobilization prior to its<br />invasion of Ukraine was widely publicized four<br />months in advance; the US invasion of Iraq in<br />2003 was preceded by at least a year of political<br />debate and months of military buildup.) More<br />broadly, I think the risk is overstated even over<br />a longer time frame (say, the next 10 years).<br />It is clear that PRC leaders consider Taiwan to<br />be a part of One China, and that \"reunification<br />is inevitable\". But an invasion would be a<br />deeply counterproductive way to bring about that<br />reunification. Xi's preferred approach is to play<br />the long game, to continue modernizing mainland<br />China to the point where it is prosperous enough<br />that the people of Taiwan will want to incorporate<br />into the PRC voluntarily.","Joe Ornstein (52%): The implied odds from the<br />sportsbook moneylines is that the Yankees have a<br />33.5% chance of winning, and the Mets have a 17.7%<br />chance.

But right now it is<br />basically a coin flip.","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,1)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.080000000000000002,0.14999999999999999,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0,0.10000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.02,0.050000000000000003,0.070000000000000007,0.01,0.050000000000000003,0,0.050000000000000003,0.050000000000000003,0,0,0.01,0.029999999999999999,0,0,0.029999999999999999,0.0050000000000000001,0.01,1.0000000000000001e-07,0.02,0.01,0.20000000000000001,0.02,0.029999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.41999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.56999999999999995,0.45000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.12,0.25,0.70999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.71999999999999997,0.29999999999999999,0.81000000000000005,0.25,0.75,0.59999999999999998,0.64000000000000001,0.33000000000000002,0.67000000000000004,0.68000000000000005,0.35999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.84999999999999998,0.75,0.72999999999999998,0.32000000000000001,0.64500000000000002,0.40500000000000003,0.75,0.20000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.28000000000000003,0.75,0.51000000000000001,0.050000000000000003,0.59999999999999998,0.71999999999999997,0.34999999999999998,0.45000000000000001,0.52000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.65000000000000002,0.75,0.32000000000000001,0.72999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.72999999999999998,0.68000000000000005,0.56000000000000005,0.57999999999999996,0.45000000000000001,0.67000000000000004,0.55000000000000004,0.55000000000000004,0.5,0.40000000000000002,0.62],"y":[1.9901949079474435,2.0349943090463056,4.0114930361974981,2.0117069017374889,2.0108428020495923,2.0119287490146234,2.0061260555405172,1.9891077908920125,2.0461672655306757,1.9542488444363699,2.0130382673582061,1.965582608897239,2.0090865063946692,2.0023633902659639,2.028551389835775,2.0160807930398734,1.9818610101705416,2.0045165958581492,1.9778951397398488,2.0131352457916365,1.9957730007125065,1.9598484605783597,2.0403321551857516,1.9794410546077414,2.0338936782674866,1.9684984609484673,2.0230112649966032,2.0338986296206714,1.9814468322321772,2.0239890492055563,1.9579065293539315,1.9513883227948099,1.992313868459314,4.0152042838744819,4.0225766500225291,4.0456210774835197,3.9711192151065915,1.0267314873635769,3.9943629826186227,3.976452792575583,3.9757442072732374,1.0170650717103853,1.0430486143566668,4.0499065838521346,1.0404316452564673,1.0021669317502528,3.9755417814943939,0.96155270568560813,3.9870651277014986,1.0212220612214877,3.9622368294978516,0.95598449234385041,4.0088957969332117,0.99781455551274123,1.0457713354378939,4.0079364610370245,0.95548159813042732,1.0334743087645619,0.99876764120999728,1.0496971084969118,3.9515441786265,1.028271113941446,4.0349694821983579,0.98377158029470591,4.0156140585197138,3.9791686021490023,3.9621867459034545,1.0087468298152089,4.0147699788445603,3.9810770604992287,0.98469591580796989,0.96584482055623089,4.0347735621966425,3.9942191847832875,3.9703508691396565,4.023285981384106,1.0425618456676602,0.96743527231737969,3.9654642672743647,0.97961460212245588,1.0266400358173997,1.0232353165978565,1.0312992247287185,4.0242000870173795,1.0237307083560154,4.0011319316690788,1.0056427193107083,4.0444692860124629,3.9604030709713696,1.007967963325791,3.9850903674494473,0.96199510798323895],"text":["Erin Ho (8%): The odds are quite low due to a lot<br />of things plaguing China at this moment, as well<br />as the logistical nightmare it would be to plan<br />an invasion at this time. Earlier this year, there<br />was a whole military scandal that revealed how<br />poorly maintained and trained militants are, with<br />recent failures on their military equipment as<br />well.","Ryan Foley (15%): This question has been looming<br />since the beginning of this year yet has not<br />seen any major change. China has consistently<br />threatened the safety of Taiwan without making<br />an actual ground invasion and I don't think that<br />will change. The US continues to protect Taiwan<br />and regardless of the outcome of the election, it<br />won't change. We still rely on Taiwan for trade,<br />so we wouldn't let our guard down enough for an<br />invasion. Though China may try to take advantage<br />of the US' election causing some chaos, I still<br />don't believe they would even act on it.","Abigail Harris (30%): Georgia will come down<br />to the little gray sliver of the pie chart—the<br />undecideds. In the same way, the whole race<br />can come down to a few thousand flip voters<br />in Pennsylvania. In Georgia, that’s anywhere<br />from 2-3% of the vote, depending on the poll.<br />Historically those voters have been Independents<br />either voting for third-party candidates or being<br />beaten into submission by the two-party system.<br />They are more likely to go right than left on<br />the issue, at about a 44/35 split. In an NYT poll<br />of Georgia in September 2024, that was narrowed<br />down to 16/9. Which tells me the Trump strategy<br />is working, bringing me down to 40%. But when<br />paired with the bain of my existence, the polling<br />data, I have to call it in favor of Trump at 30%<br />likelihood of Harris taking Georgia.","Abby Crowe (20%): Although tensions are as high<br />as ever, I predict only a 20% chance that China<br />invades Taiwan before December of this year.<br />This is due to a collection of themes including<br />US-China relations, ongoing world conflicts, and<br />Taiwan’s resolve. (Briefing)","Colin Barry (0%): Unless an international incident<br />were to occur in the strait between the two<br />nations between now the December 1st, I do not<br />see a Chinese invasion of Taiwan by then. This<br />is supported by China themselves not even feeling<br />fully prepared for the invasion at the moment,<br />instead having 2027 set as their target date for<br />the invasion of Taiwan.","Kira Liscombe (10%): According to the Department<br />of Defense, Chinese President Xi Jinping has<br />a strategic window in the 2030 timeframe when<br />favorable conditions exist to forcefully annex<br />Taiwan if peaceful unification is not achieved<br />before then. My mom is a Colonel in the Air<br />Force and was actually talking about this to me<br />the other day and mentioned how China is being<br />very patient with their timeline for possible<br />war. I also think China will be looking towards<br />the results of the US election since a potential<br />Taiwan invasion will have intense diplomatic<br />effects between the US and China. Additionally,<br />the People’s Liberation Army of China is<br />undertaking a defense modernization and is not<br />predicted to be fully prepared for war until 2027.<br />With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, I do<br />not see it likely that China will make an attack<br />on Taiwan by December.","Findleigh Ague (15%): Some key points I found that<br />helped me make my decision: The Taiwanese military<br />believes that China will be fully prepared for<br />a in invasion in 2025. Also, Taiwan is crucial<br />to the global economy because 90% of the world's<br />semiconductor manufacturing occurs in Taiwan.<br />An invasion of Taiwan would be detrimental to<br />the world's economy, so even if countries (like<br />the U.S.) don't support Taiwanese independence,<br />it is still in their best interest to support<br />a stable relationship between Taiwan and China<br />and maintain peaceful cross-strait interactions.<br />As long as both the U.S. and China and other<br />world superpowers are reliant on them for these<br />resources, an invasion would be extremely unwise.<br />However, this could definitely present an issue<br />for Taiwan in the future, as the U.S. is moving<br />towards semiconductor sovereignty, and they are<br />one of their top trading partners. I think that in<br />the next few years we will se an invasion, but not<br />quite yet.","Jessica Armour (10%): Invading Taiwan would but<br />a major negative impact on the economy as well<br />as technology. With that being said, TSMC is such<br />an important part of international technology,<br />according to GZERO Media. Therefore, it would not<br />be a smart move for China to invade Taiwan.","Haley Ford (2%): China can do a lot to Taiwan<br />coercively that does not involve military invasion<br />- additionally even if China were to invade Taiwan<br />the chances it occurs in the next 2 months are<br />incredibly low- additionally this would involve<br />a lot of money/technology/dealings with Taiwans<br />allies etc.","Hayden Morehouse (5%): There have been no new<br />real threats with this conflict in the past couple<br />months. The window for this invasion is expected<br />to be later in this decade. I feel like the odds<br />of this happening in the next two months is low.","Liv Payne (7%): Taiwain has been independent<br />from China since 1949. This has not stopped the<br />massive country from claiming Taiwan as its own,<br />despite Taiwan possessing its own government and<br />claiming sovereignty. Despite tension between the<br />two, and despite China's ever encroaching military<br />power (referred to as the \"anaconda strategy\" by<br />Taiwain's Navy Admiral Tang Hua), it seems more<br />likely that an attack will be economic, or their<br />threats will cajole Taiwain into a premature<br />surrender. I did read an excerpt of The Ambitious<br />Dragon, which posits that China's president Xi<br />Jinping may invade by 2030 if he does not get<br />his way before then. Jinping has always run on a<br />platform that highlights \"reuinification\", and he<br />seems willing to take Taiwan by force if he must.<br />However, the likelhood of this happening before<br />December of this year seems greatly unlikely. I<br />would like to note that, in response to a recent<br />speech by Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te that<br />reinforced Taiwan's independence, China's response<br />was to practice military drills closer to Taiwain.<br />Because of this, I have bumped my prediction up<br />a few points, but unless something drastic occurs<br />because of it, the likelihood for me remains low.","Simon Gersten (1%): Economically it does not make<br />sense for China. They would receive international<br />backlash that would make any military action<br />against Taiwan pyrrhic at best and catastrophic to<br />the country at worst. In conjunction, newly formed<br />international alliances such as AUKUS would make<br />a military victory very difficult. China is in no<br />position to launch a full scale invasion for the<br />foreseeable future.","Corinne O'Dell (5%): It is unlikely that<br />China will invade Taiwan by December 1. A<br />military invasion would likely provoke a strong<br />international response, especially from the<br />United States and its allies, which could lead<br />to a broader conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />China also has to consider the severe economic<br />consequences, as Taiwan is a global leader in<br />semiconductor production, and any disruption<br />would have far-reaching effects on global supply<br />chains, including in China itself. Additionally,<br />an invasion could destabilize China's domestic<br />economy and lead to political unrest, outcomes<br />that Beijing would likely want to avoid.","David Daniels (0%): The likelihood of China<br />invading Taiwan before December 1, 2024, is<br />extremely low, close to 0%. Factors such as<br />economic risks, strong U.S. alliances, and<br />diplomatic considerations make such an action<br />highly improbable. Additionally, China's focus on<br />internal stability and growth, along with Taiwan's<br />preparedness, further diminishes the immediate<br />likelihood of military conflict by December.<br />Taking all of these factors into account, I assess<br />the probability to be 0%.","Shayna Van Glish (5%): I think that there is a<br />5% chance that China invades Taiwan by Dec 1.<br />China is not fully prepared to launch an imminent<br />invasion based on available intelligence and<br />military assessments. Potentially in the future,<br />but it is too early for this to be happening at<br />the end of 2024.","Brooke Mcdermott (5%): The likelihood of a<br />full-scale invasion happening is very low. There<br />are multiple indirect advances China could use<br />in order to annex Taiwan, or make them incredibly<br />vulnerable. Additionally, with the aid packages<br />the U.S. has sent Taiwan along with the supposed<br />arms purchase they made with the Pentagon, it<br />seems the U.S. would back Taiwan if the event of<br />invasion occurs. Additionally, Japan has openly<br />commented on helping Taiwan in the case of an<br />invasion or full-scale war. China may invade,<br />but I highly doubt it will happen this fall. I<br />hedged my bets some for this prediction because<br />Xi Jinping has been making comments about Taiwan<br />eventually \"reunifying\" with China, but those<br />comments have been made many a times by previous<br />leaders.","William Willis (0%): At the moment I believe<br />that there is a 0% probability that China invades<br />Taiwan by Dec 1. I think this is the case because<br />this invasion would be one of the most complex<br />military invasions in history. Also transporting<br />men on ships is extremely difficult at this moment<br />because of the conditions in the water being very<br />difficult to navigate. China has also not fought a<br />major war in seven decades and that makes me think<br />that they an invasion will be a big process.","Vikram Bharadwaj (0%): Now while some people may<br />consider the fact that China has shown increased<br />animosity towards Taiwan, particularly with their<br />Military Drills as of late march of this year, it<br />may seem that China is ramping up for an invasion<br />of Taiwan. Without a doubt I agree with this<br />opinion. China is definitely preparing for an<br />invasion of Taiwan, but the question of whether<br />they will invade by December is an obvious no.<br />There is no universe where the PLA has either<br />enough manpower, secured resources, or even enough<br />support of the people to begin an invasion of<br />Taiwan within less than two months. I believe that<br />there is no real world in which China will be able<br />to nor will invade Taiwan, thus I give it a zero<br />percent chance of occurring. Should this happen,<br />Xi must want the obliteration of both Taiwan and<br />my brier score.","Alex Vrolijk (1%): Despite increasing tensions<br />between China and Taiwan, with more news currently<br />breaking about the worsening of relations; it<br />is highly improbable that China will invade<br />Taiwan. This is because of the difficulty of the<br />specifications for a cross-strait invasion as well<br />as the vast number of allies tied to both China<br />and Taiwan.","Alexis Frazer (3%): China is unlikely to invade<br />Taiwan due to several significant factors.<br />First, a military invasion would likely provoke<br />a strong international response, which could lead<br />to severe economic sanctions and even military<br />conflict. Additionally, an invasion would be<br />highly costly and risky for China, as Taiwan is<br />well-armed and its geography makes it difficult to<br />invade. Lastly, Beijing may prefer to pursue its<br />long-term goal of reunification through diplomatic<br />and economic pressure rather than through a<br />potentially devastating war.","Abigail Harris (0%): According to the Army’s<br />ambitious dragon reports, China would be most<br />likely to invade Taiwan by around 2030. That’s<br />based off their military forces being prepared<br />for invasion, and potential American backlash by<br />2027 based on an aging population and Xi Jinping’s<br />age, nearly in his 70s. But he has made it a life<br />goal for china to reunify with Taiwan. So maybe<br />the idea of starting nuclear war between two major<br />nuclear international powers armed with NUKES<br />depends on how likely he feels he’ll be around to<br />see that.","Reece Slater (0%): No chance. This will be such a<br />political, economic, and military risk for China.<br />It would be very costly, and I think tensions<br />would have to be extremely high for there to be a<br />full-scale invasion. I do not see tensions rising<br />to this insane level in 2 months. China has said<br />in the past that they want to unify with Taiwan<br />through peaceful methods. Regardless if this is<br />true or not, I do not see China invading Taiwan by<br />Dec 1. Possibly in the next 5 years or so, but not<br />in the next 2 months.","Victor Avila (3%): I find it highly unlikely<br />that China invades Taiwan by December first, only<br />giving it a 3% probability of occurring. Part of<br />my main reasoning is the complexity of what an<br />invasion of Taiwan would look like. China would<br />most likely need to use land, sea, air, and even<br />cyber warfare in order to take the island, and<br />the climate may be what stands in China's way.<br />In order to invade Taiwan I would think without<br />a doubt that China would use their navy, as<br />they now stand as the world's largest navy. In<br />order to perform a naval operation in Taiwan<br />from China, you must cross the Taiwan strait.<br />Taiwan strait’s waters are extremely choppy due<br />to constantly being in a tsunami season, with the<br />exception of October and April, making the time<br />slot expiring soon. (This greatly helped me narrow<br />down my questioning). With no signs of an imminent<br />military takeover like troops at the border, and<br />the season expiring for allowing an invasion is<br />coming to end, I find this highly unlikely.","Edward Tsui (0.5%): Most projections are by 2027<br />or by 2030 for China to invade Taiwan. Right now,<br />the Chinese are pressuring the sea around Taiwan,<br />but I do not see this pressure leading to a<br />full-outright invasion at this time, especially in<br />two months. Polymarket is predicting a 4% chance,<br />but I think it is lower. I don't think I can also<br />put 0% since there is still a chance.","Carson Ankeny (1%): There is no reasonable<br />explanation for China to invade Taiwan before<br />December. There is certainly tension there but<br />international pressures are definitely preventing<br />a full blown invasion entirely. China invading<br />Taiwan would be international relations suicide<br />and I think they’re content to keep on pushing<br />the tension with issues like the 9 dash line and<br />the Olympics more than they’re willing to fully<br />invade.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (1e-05%): I talk about it<br />extensively in my briefing, but I'll say this. The<br />invasion will happen sooner than later, but I am<br />confident it won't occur in 2024. If it does occur<br />in 2024, the invasion will definitely have that<br />surprise factor. I think a blockade is inevitable,<br />but it won't occur in 2024.","Gracie Culpepper (2%): This is incredibly unlikely<br />and I really don't think that this will happen.","Leo Zegarra (1%): The probability that China<br />will launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan by<br />December 1, 2024, is very low, and I think it's<br />very close to 0%. Despite ongoing tensions, China<br />is more likely to focus on diplomatic and economic<br />measures rather than risking a major conflict with<br />the U.S. and its allies. The consequences of such<br />an action would be too destabilizing for China’s<br />global ambitions at this time, especially for if<br />it were to happen in less than two months","Ladi Fashogbon (20%): based on the influence<br />of military readiness, political climate, and<br />potential international response, they are<br />unlikely to invade but not completely zero.","Minha Ahmad (2%): I would say that, based on<br />current conditions, it is highly unlikely that<br />China will invade Taiwan any time soon.","Sara Whitmire (3%): This could potentially happen<br />in, like, 2030, but there's not much motivation to<br />do it now. A survey of Taiwanese people said that<br />a majority don't anticipate an invasion in the<br />next few years.","John Mathis (10%): Not only would this cause<br />major global conflict to break out, limiting<br />trade and commerce, but it would also anger the<br />United States, which could be disastrous for them.<br />Overall there is too much to lose versus what is<br />gained by invading Taiwan","Franco Bravo (10%): I believe that this is<br />something that has been talked about for years.<br />However I believe that with the war in Russia and<br />Chinese affiliation with the Russian. Alongside<br />the upcoming election, I just don’t think<br />this would be the right time unless there was<br />significant aggression from Taiwan.","Reece Slater (42%): Trump is leading Harris in<br />Georgia by about 1 or 2 points across all the<br />polls. I am going to give Trump the solid edge<br />in Georgia. Trump also has a higher favorability<br />rating in Georgia.","Ryan Foley (40%): Georgia is one of the most<br />important states in this election, with a huge<br />portion of advertising money being poured into the<br />state. Trump is currently polling at 48.2% with<br />Kamala following behind by only 1%. Last election,<br />Georgia was won by Democrats by about 11,000 votes<br />as well making this race extremely tight. This<br />makes it difficult to make an accurate prediction<br />as there's many factors influencing the outcome.<br />Currently, Trump is pushing a misinformation<br />campaign in Georgia trying to swing voters on<br />the idea that FEMA has abandoned them. This will<br />cement Republican votes, meanwhile Kamala is doing<br />what she can to pull in young voters to increase<br />the Democratic turnout. Both Trump and Kamala<br />appear to constantly be doing damage control as<br />well so it is really hard for me to tell which way<br />the state could go, but Georgia is historically<br />red so I give the advantage to Trump.","Colin Barry (40%): Trump currently holds a narrow<br />lead in most polls for Georgia's vote in the<br />presidential election. I think this trend is more<br />likely than not to hold come November as the state<br />is still historically a red state and the state<br />government and governor are still almost all red<br />in most government positions.","Jessica Armour (30%): Based on research and<br />prediction completed by AI as well as information<br />from \"The Hill,\" Trump has an advantage over<br />Harris in winning Georgia. With that being said,<br />from 1996-2016 Georgia has voted Republican.<br />Therefore I think Harris will more than likely not<br />win over Georgia.","Kira Liscombe (57%): I made the forecast that on<br />a scale of 0 to 100, there is a probability of<br />57 that a New York team wins the World Series. I<br />explain this in further depth in my briefing.","Brooke Mcdermott (45%): The Harris team just<br />pumped $31 million into GA radio and television<br />ads for the next three weeks, which I think may<br />bring her closer to a win. Although I'm unsure<br />if this will have a substantial change to the<br />outcome, I do think this will have a big effect<br />on outreach. Additionally, a big aspect is the<br />approach the White House has going forward with<br />Helene recovery.","Jeffrey Markowitz (60%): Wrote breifing","David Daniels (12%): Historically, Trump has<br />outperformed his polling by a considerable margin.<br />It is relatively likely that Trump will take the<br />state of Georgia, as he is currently leading by<br />over a point according to most polling agencies.<br />That being said, I give Kamala a 12% probability<br />of winning the state of Georgia in the 2024<br />election.","Jessica Armour (25%): As of right now it looks<br />like the Padres are going to win the World Series.<br />Although the Yankees were off to a decent start<br />the Padres are now in the lead and more people are<br />predicting that they are going to win. They also<br />have decent pitching and hitting, so it is very<br />likely that they win rather than a New York team.","David Daniels (71%): I analyzed the probability<br />of either the Mets or Yankees winning the 2024<br />World Series by looking at the money lines across<br />major platforms, which averaged out to about<br />52%. But then I considered that some teams, like<br />Kansas City, Detroit, and Cleveland, are somewhat<br />unlikely to win. By removing those teams, the<br />probability jumped up to 64%. If I went a step<br />further and removed all teams with a money line<br />over +549, the probability increased to 79%. Since<br />I find it reasonable to dismiss some of the less<br />likely teams, I decided to split the difference<br />between 64% and 79%, which gave me a final<br />probability of 71%.","Carson Ankeny (20%): Aside from just polling,<br />Georgia seems like one of the most difficult swing<br />states for Kamala to perform in. I think that it<br />is much more likely that she wins a state like<br />North Carolina, or the Midwestern states, rather<br />than Georgia, and it doesn't really seem like<br />Georgia is a huge focus of her campaign right now<br />compared to the Midwest (MI, WI, PA, etc.) Also<br />I know that polling isn't everything but from<br />a combination of knowing this state and having<br />worked on campaigns in the past I don't think<br />there's that great of a chance that she takes the<br />state.","Carson Ankeny (70%): Both the New York Mets and<br />the New York Yankees are guaranteed within the top<br />4 teams going to the NLCS and the ALCS. For this<br />reason, there should at least be a 50% chance that<br />one of them will win the World Series. On top of<br />that, I think that the Yankees are heavily favored<br />vs either the Tigers/Guardians, and the Padres<br />and Mets are virtually even. Baseball playoffs<br />are very much based on who has a hot streak and<br />who doesn't, and as badly as I may personally want<br />the Padres to win it all, it seems like the Mets<br />are SUPER hot and the Yankees are hot enough to<br />make it past the AL Central teams who really only<br />made it to the playoffs because of the format and<br />the fact that they were in the same division as<br />the lowly Chicago White Sox. A bit of luck made<br />it so they could survive the wild card, but the<br />results of the Yankees-Royals series seem to show<br />the flaws in the AL Central, and the strength of<br />the Yankees... All of that is to say that it seems<br />fairly likely that the Yankees will made the World<br />Series, and the Mets have about a 50/50 shot vs.<br />the Padres.","Vikram Bharadwaj (72%): Currently both New<br />york teams have advanced to their respective<br />championship series', increasing the odds<br />significantly. I did the math, and given the<br />current streaks each team is on, coupled with the<br />current weakness that the other teams have in the<br />playoffs, along with the overarching strength that<br />the mets have gained midway through the season, I<br />find it significantly likely that one of the teams<br />(IMO most likely the mets) will win the world<br />series.","Vikram Bharadwaj (30%): Given that Georgia<br />went blue for biden, it make seem likely that<br />Harris would be able to garner similar support,<br />however if we look at current polling numbers,<br />there really does not seem like this will occur.<br />Currently most polls hold trump as either a<br />1 or 2 point favorite for the state, and with<br />the devastation and misinformation surrounding<br />Helene an Fema's response, it is likely that more<br />republican voters will simply turn out for this<br />election. On top of this, lower vote in ballots<br />are indicators of a weaker chance at a democrat<br />victory within the state.","Colin Barry (81%): Both the Yankees have already<br />clinched semifinal spots in their league's<br />respective championship series, as well as having<br />the first and third best odds to win the World<br />Series currently. The teams also have the two<br />highest payrolls in baseball, a trend that has<br />historically indicated good things for a team to<br />win the title. These put my odds at a very likely<br />81% for one of the two teams to win the World<br />Series.","Abby Crowe (25%): I predict a 25% chance that<br />Harris wins Georgia. I think that Georgia going<br />blue was a fluke the first time unfortunately, and<br />those who were upset about it are going to turn<br />it around this election. It’s not impossible that<br />Harris wins, but I don’t think it is super likely.","Abby Crowe (75%): I predict an 75% chance that a<br />NY team wins the world series. Both the Mets and<br />Yankees are in the final four and have high odds,<br />and therefore I think one of them will be the<br />champs this year.","Liv Payne (60%): Historically, Georgia has been<br />one of the swing states, and is labeled as a<br />\"purple state\" by some. In 2020, Biden won the<br />state by a very slim margin (49.5% versus Trump<br />at 49.3%). In 2016, Trump won with 50.8% of the<br />votes. Currently, Trump leads in Georgia by 0.9<br />percent (48.2% versus Harris' 47.3%) acording to<br />Fivethirtyeight. When I was researching for this<br />question, I soon came to learn that it is tied<br />to another question for later: will more young<br />people vote in this election? I found that a hub<br />of Democratic votes is in Atlanta: 45% of those<br />who live in the Atlanta Metro area are Democratic<br />or Democratic leaning (out of a population of<br />over 499,00 as of 2022, though it has risen by<br />15% since then). Studies show that, after Harris<br />replaced Biden on the ballot, voter registration<br />spiked nationally, especially among young women of<br />color. This new wave of voters seems sympathetic<br />to Harris and lean blue. So, it is my prediction<br />that, if Harris wins Atlanta, as she seems slated<br />to do, then she will win Georgia. However, given<br />Trump's current lead, it remains to be seen.<br />If she does win, it will likely be by a narrow<br />margin, just as Biden did.","Reece Slater (64%): The Yankees are currently<br />favored to win the world series, and the Mets<br />are the 3rd favorite. Also, FanDuel has a bet of<br />\"New York Yankees and Mets vs The Field,\" and it<br />is currently at -122 odds, so a slight favorite.<br />Putting this all together, I think a bit above 50<br />is a solid bet.","Edward Tsui (33%): Most polls, betting odds, and<br />websites that I have looked at have quoted Trump<br />being ahead by Kamala from anywhere from 20% to<br />5 %. I'm not sure which sources to trust right<br />now, but since Trump tends to have under reporting<br />voters, I find that the probability difference<br />may be higher. My guess is that Kamala is not the<br />front leader of the state as of right now, but<br />things could change between now and November 5th.<br />Websites I looked at were 538, Forbes, Polymarket,<br />Kalshi, and the New York Times.","Edward Tsui (67%): The Yankees and Mets are on<br />fire right now, and while the Dodgers also have<br />favorable odds to win the series, they have lost<br />some favor playing the Padres. I think there is<br />a shot that at least one New York team makes the<br />World Series, but who wins it could be a slight<br />toss up. Personally, the betting odds are in favor<br />of the Yankees, and I think the Mets might take<br />it all. I kinda hope that both teams make it, but<br />my final match up prediction is the Yankees vs<br />Dodgers or Yankees Vs Mets. Dodgers suck though.<br />Can't pay for Rings, but you can buy superstars<br />for sure.","Erin Ho (68%): After the games on October 10, the<br />NY Yankees are highly favored to win the World<br />Series right now with the LA Dodgers and the NY<br />Mets behind them. I don’t keep up enough with<br />baseball to know but having both New York teams<br />heightened the chances of either one winning. Most<br />articles online favor these three teams.","Erin Ho (36%): With new polls out, it looks less<br />likely that Harris will win the state of Georgia.<br />As of right now, Trump has a higher lead than<br />Harris in the polls for Georgia. Despite Georgia<br />being a swing state in the 2020 election, the<br />Republican party has made more efforts to hold<br />their ground, and many independent voters are<br />amongst the indecisive.","Liv Payne (10%): Full disclosure: I know nothing<br />about baseball, so I knew this would be a rather<br />difficult question for me. I looked at several<br />different sources, betting sites, and I learned<br />how betting odds work (though I still don't 100%<br />get it since I've never done it myself). Despite<br />this, I learned that there are currently two New<br />York teams in the lineup right now: the Yankees<br />and the Mets. On Friday, the Padres will play<br />against the Dodgers, and whoever wins will go<br />against the Yankees. Based on betting odds, it<br />seems that the Dodgers are predicted to win with<br />a probability of 57% (according to Fox Sports). If<br />this is the case, they will then go up against the<br />New York Mets, where the Dodgers have a history<br />of beating the team from New York (out of six<br />games played this season the Mets have only won<br />2). Assuming this trend continues (as the Dodgers<br />is a team of \"all stars\" according to Fansided),<br />then the Dodgers move onto the finals. On the<br />other side of the bracket, we are still waiting<br />on the results of the Cleveland Guardians versus<br />the Detroit Tigers, and whoever wins will play the<br />New York Yankees. Across the board, it seems as if<br />people are predicting the Tigers to win, incluidng<br />Fox Sports (who gives tehm a 57% chance),<br />ClutchPoints, and NBC Sports. If they do win, then<br />they play the Yankees. In Postseason, these two<br />teams have a win-loss ratio of 1-3, favoring the<br />Tigers. Despite this, the Yankees are favored in<br />the World Series overall, so they may clutch a<br />win. If they get knocked out, and the Mets fall<br />to the Dodgers as they are expected to, then that<br />means there is a 0% chance of a New York team<br />winning. However, I find this unlikely. Therefore,<br />I predict that the Yankees will win, and go on to<br />face the Dodgers. If this happens, then the crowd<br />favors the Yankees. A lot of things need to happen<br />in order to predict the eventual winner of the<br />World Series. With two teams on the bulletin, New<br />York increases their chances of having a team win<br />overall, but it does not guarantee it. Given that<br />the Yankees are the pick of the season, this gives<br />them an edge, but the Dodgers are not too far<br />behind. Who knows, Los Angeles may knock both New<br />York teams out of the ring. Overall, I would give<br />New York a 10% chance of winning, though this will<br />be heavily dependant on who wins the games this<br />weekend.","Matthew Harvey (85%): My<br />expectations/understandings of this series of<br />baseball are quite limited, however from what I<br />have done with the research I have conducted, both<br />the Yankees and the Mets are on fire right now.<br />There is quite a possibility both are in line to<br />win both leagues and therefore square off against<br />each other in the World Series. I am going to try<br />a new tactic for this question and full send off<br />of little information and see how that treats me.<br />This is a beta example.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): I think that a NY team is<br />pretty likely to win the world series. It is not<br />guaranteed but either the mets or the yankees have<br />a chance putting it at 75%","Alexis Frazer (73%): Briefing","Alexis Frazer (32%): Kamala Harris faces<br />significant challenges in winning the state<br />of Georgia in the 2024 presidential election.<br />Although Georgia turned blue in 2020 for the first<br />time in decades, it remains a highly competitive<br />swing state with strong Republican support,<br />particularly in rural areas. Although the polls<br />are currently close between Harris and Trump,<br />Trump is favored to win the state of Georgia.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (64.5%): I talked with<br />my friend, who loves baseball, and he said, \"I'd<br />say fairly likely that one makes it.\" He then used<br />some baseball lingo, but essentially I think it<br />is possible. I also looked at some of the betting<br />odds, and New York teams are favored.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (40.5%): I do not want<br />to put a definite no because state polls are<br />1) unreliable, 2) the polls have been so close<br />lately. Personally, I do not think Harris can<br />win the state like Biden did in 2020. But at the<br />same time, I think of all the campaigning she has<br />done, and I can't help but wonder if any of it<br />has actually been successful. One thing that is<br />also in my mind is if Hurricane Helene affected<br />this election in any way. The hurricane displaced<br />people, and maybe some people are unhappy or happy<br />with the administration's response.","William Willis (75%): I feel pretty good about a<br />New York team winning the world series at a 75%<br />probability. The reason that I picked this number<br />is because the only other team I was worried about<br />was the Padres and I feel like they are about to<br />run out of steam. The Yankees have an easier road<br />to the World Series and won't be grasping for air.","William Willis (20%): I feel that it is very<br />unlikely that Kamala Harris wins the state of<br />Georgia. Georgia has been a predominately red<br />state and Joe Biden in 2020 was the first time in<br />30 years that it was a red state. Kamala going on<br />these talk shows is not helping her case either.<br />I truly believe that she has lost the election<br />because of her October antics.","Victor Avila (40%): Will Kamala Harris win the<br />state of Georgia? Although the presidential race<br />seems neck and neck at the moment, I give Kamala<br />Harris a 40% probability of winning the state<br />of Georgia. The reason I think Donald Trump will<br />take a victory in Georgia is because not only<br />does he have a lead in the current polls, but<br />also an Atlanta Journal Constitution poll measured<br />voters top priorities in georgia, and top results<br />included inflation and the economy, which I think<br />most voters associate more with Biden and Harris.","Abigail Harris (28%): Unsurprisingly, Georgia will<br />come down to the little gray sliver of the pie<br />chart—the undecideds. In the same way, the whole<br />race can come down to a few thousand flip voters<br />in Pennsylvania. In Georgia, that’s anywhere<br />from 2-3% of the vote, depending on the poll.<br />Historically those voters have been Independents<br />either voting for third-party candidates or being<br />beaten into submission by the two-party system.<br />They are more likely to go right than left on<br />the issue, at about a 44/35 split. In an NYT poll<br />of Georgia in September 2024, that was narrowed<br />down to 16/9. Which tells me the Trump strategy<br />is working, bringing me down to 40%. But when<br />paired with the bain of my existence, the polling<br />data, I have to call it in favor of Trump at 30%<br />likelihood of Harris taking Georgia.","Abigail Harris (75%): I know nothing about<br />baseball! I thought that would make this super<br />tedious but after looking at a few power rankings<br />and talking to a couple of guys in matching<br />polo khaki short combos I got the jist of it.<br />The Mets and Yankees are both doing very well<br />for themselves with longstanding hot streaks,<br />historically a good indicator of success for<br />the World Series. The Mets and Yankees are being<br />favored on several of the sports betting sites I<br />looked at and even if the Mets don't make to the<br />finals, the Yankees are very likely to.","Franco Bravo (51%): I believe that this is one<br />of the closest questions we’ve had all semester<br />long, and I believe that kamela will win with<br />the ever so slightest margin. In my opinion the<br />longer Trump and kamela engage in discourse,<br />trumps weakness will start to become orevelant,<br />and therefore allow her to take control of main<br />counties like Fulton","Simon Gersten (5%): Based off current polling and<br />registration trends, I think this is extremely<br />unlikely.","Simon Gersten (60%): Both New York teams have<br />moved on to the next round of the playoffs and<br />seem to be the powerhouse teams. They are both<br />equally likely to advance to the World Series,<br />which would guarantee this question.","Corinne O'Dell (72%): A New York team is looking<br />strong for a World Series victory this year,<br />particularly the Yankees. With star power like<br />Aaron Judge and Juan Soto leading the offense,<br />combined with their consistent pitching, they have<br />the depth to go far. While other teams like the<br />Padres and Phillies are also serious contenders,<br />the Yankees’ balanced roster and postseason<br />experience make them a top favorite for the<br />championship.","Corinne O'Dell (35%): Georgia remains a<br />battleground state, but Trump is currently holding<br />a lead. Sources suggest Trump may be slightly<br />favored in Georgia due to strong Republican<br />support and a narrower lead for Harris than<br />expected.Trump’s base in the state is resilient,<br />and his support from the popular Republican<br />Governor Brian Kemp adds to the GOP’s optimism<br />about winning Georgia.","Haley Ford (45%): Before Georgia went blue for<br />Joe Biden, it had been since Clinton in '92.<br />Trump seems to be having a slight edge in various<br />pollings for Kamala, but the states shift to blue<br />the last election cycle shows demographic changes<br />of the Atlanta metro area/suburbs that are hard to<br />discount when assigning a probability.","Sara Whitmire (52%): I might be overly optimistic,<br />but a lot of the Harris campaign’s policies<br />are similar to Biden’s, and he won by a narrow<br />margin last election. Trump is only leading by<br />1% according to today’s NYT poll. That’s the<br />most simple explanation, the rest of it is a gut<br />feeling. The odds of every single swing state<br />going to Trump feels low, and I think Georgia has<br />potential to be blue again.","Minha Ahmad (30%): Donald Trump appears to be<br />winning in the polls currently for Georgia. The<br />main factor that is stopping me from stating a 0<br />probability is Atlanta. There is still a slight<br />possibility that Kamala will win enough votes due<br />to her popularity in Atlanta in order to win the<br />state.","Minha Ahmad (65%): Both the Mets and Yankees<br />are doing pretty well and are set to get first,<br />second, or third.","Sara Whitmire (75%): I’m not super knowledgeable<br />about baseball, but a lot of the sports betting<br />websites I looked through have their money on the<br />Yankees and the Mets. I’m gonna go where the money<br />is 🥸","Gracie Culpepper (32%): Although it can't be fully<br />crossed out, I think overall it is more likely<br />that GA will swing red in this election.","Gracie Culpepper (73%): I don't know much about<br />baseball, but based on different stats I looked at<br />and what broadcasters have discussed, I think it's<br />fairly likely that a New York team could win.","Alex Vrolijk (60%): This is because both the<br />Yankees and the Mets have moved on to their<br />respective League Championship series. After<br />Yankees win last night, their odds to win the<br />World Series on the predictive market shot up as<br />the current highest probability to win. I believe<br />the Yankees have a very high probability to beat<br />Tigers/Guardians. The reason why I did not choose<br />higher is because I believe the winner of the<br />Dodgers/Padres will beat the Mets and will go on<br />to have a good chance of beating the Yankees in<br />the World Series.","Leo Zegarra (73%): It seems to be that the betting<br />odds are currently in favor of the Yankees, with<br />the Mets in third place. Also, the betting odds<br />are also in favor of both New York teams being in<br />the final, making it certain that a New York team<br />wins it all. Either way, the second best odds is<br />that at least the Yankees are in the final, so I<br />give the chances to be pretty high.","Victor Avila (68%): As 4 teams remain in the MLB<br />post season, the Yankees and the Mets are so far<br />the only teams to go through to the Semi-finals.<br />The Dodgers were the favorites going into the post<br />season, although the Yankees have surpassed them<br />after their win against the Kansas City Royals.<br />Although I think this prediction is fragile<br />because I think Shohei Ohtani is insane, I think<br />the success of these two teams in the post season<br />so far proves this likely.","Leo Zegarra (56%): I gave Kamala Harris a 56%<br />chance of winning Georgia due to the fact that the<br />state is becoming more competitive politically.<br />While it has leaned Republican in the past, recent<br />trends indicate a shift, especially in urban<br />areas. Harris does need to maintain the support<br />that helped flip Georgia in 2020, however, and<br />with strong Republican efforts to reclaim the<br />state, this is not a guarantee.","Haley Ford (58%): I used the ESPN bet odds<br />and found the combined probability, however in<br />terms of baseball you do not want to be overly<br />confident.","John Mathis (45%): Every poll I have seen shows<br />Kamala as the underdog for the state. If Georgia<br />doesn’t have the record turnout it had last year<br />it’s very unlikely, and after talking to Theron<br />Johnson and Brian Robinson of the Political<br />Breakfast Podcast, I don’t think it’s very likely.","John Mathis (67%): The Yankees are the current<br />favorite to win, with the Mets third in<br />contention. The Mets have also been on fire this<br />offseason, only losing a couple games. Considering<br />that the Mets and the Yankees are already both<br />in their conference championship, I think it’s<br />certainly likely that one of them will end up in<br />the World Series. The only thing holding me back<br />is that Shohei Ohtani is an athletic freak and I<br />have no doubt that him and Betts can win it all if<br />in the World Series.","Alex Vrolijk (55%): The fact that Georgia voted<br />blue in the 2020 presidential election and both<br />our senators are Democrats shows a shifting trend<br />in Georgia. Trump is also a polarizing figure with<br />the chance to make more controversial statements<br />before the election. Public polls show Trump and<br />Kamala within margin of error so they are not much<br />to go off of.","Findleigh Ague (55%): The two nonpartisan polls<br />of Georgia, Emerson College and Redfield & Wilton<br />Strategies, both put Kamala Harris and Donald<br />Trump at pretty much even in terms of who will win<br />the state of Georgia. Emerson College says it's<br />50/50 for likely voters, and Redfield & Wilton<br />says they're both at 47%. Many national polls,<br />however, like FiveThrityEight show Trump leading<br />by 0.7. Something important to note is that this<br />poll was taken right before their debate. In an<br />article I read, it said that 120,000 new voters<br />had registered Democrat, so that is something to<br />keep in mind, but I couldn't find anything further<br />on that. Pew Research Center says that party<br />affiliation is split evenly with 41% for both<br />parties and 18% with no lean or affiliation. It's<br />hard to say when it's such a close race, and many<br />experts consider it a toss up, but I'm going to<br />give Kamala a slight advantage.","Ladi Fashogbon (50%): There are about 5 other<br />teams with a better win ratio, but this sport is<br />unpredictable.","Ladi Fashogbon (40%): Trump has a bigger base<br />here, especially in suburban areas. It was a toss<br />up before, but the people who voted are not likely<br />to increase for Kamala. The AP projection is also<br />60/40.","Findleigh Ague (62%): I don't know a ton about<br />baseball, but I have seen that the Yankees<br />are favored to win the World Series currently,<br />and that the MLB wants the matchup to be<br />Dodgers-Yankees. Out of the 11 World Series that<br />have been between these two teams, the Yankees<br />have won 8 of the games. Considering this and<br />the fact that if the Dodgers didn't make it,<br />they would likely face the Padres and have a<br />15-9 winning history over them, I think it is<br />relatively likely that they could win the World<br />Series. The only other team to beat would be<br />the Mets, which is also a New York team, so that<br />wouldn't really matter. I think a NY team has a<br />good chance of winning, but this is all banking<br />on the fact that a NY team makes it to the World<br />Series."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.34999999999999998,0.46999999999999997,0.46000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.55000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.45000000000000001,0.64000000000000001,0.51000000000000001,0.47999999999999998,0.60999999999999999,0.42999999999999999,0.51000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.47999999999999998,0.45000000000000001,0.46999999999999997,0.46000000000000002,0.55000000000000004,0.57999999999999996,0.54000000000000004,0.46500000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.75,0.17999999999999999,0.47999999999999998,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.55000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.47999999999999998],"y":[3.0221472434466703,2.9846284223953261,2.9540062417276203,2.9921180568402632,2.9734268306288869,3.0041907044826077,2.9730000492185353,2.9735318389954046,3.0342607891885565,2.9764550319872796,2.96409650654532,2.9878894455498086,2.9519052497809755,3.0313377560116352,3.0109635055065156,3.0401415160624312,2.9897881715092809,2.9741816149326041,3.0016987561713906,2.9926490967394783,3.0207062234170734,2.9834348365431653,3.0133720660815015,3.0454521925421432,2.9689013085560871,3.0271424769656732,3.0142476436682046,2.9678056457312776,3.0187029050197451,3.0439608954591675,2.9678927552420644],"text":["Ryan Foley (35%): Since Kamala has become the<br />candidate for the Democratic Party, Trump's<br />polling has consistently gone down. After<br />debates, unclear policy, and playing into the<br />fear of Americans his chances of winning do not<br />look too probable. Kamala's campaign is focused<br />on instilling hope into Americans, meanwhile,<br />Trump is busy trying to stoke immigration<br />fears throughout the US. While this works<br />with some Republicans, his recent statements<br />regarding Haitian immigrants in Ohio have hurt<br />his credibility. This is the primary point on<br />which his campaign is built meaning he does<br />not have much else to run on. Combining this<br />with his endorsement of Mark Robinson and his<br />own controversies, his chances dip further.<br />The only recent bump he may have is regarding<br />his statements on FEMA which could increase his<br />chances slightly.","Abby Crowe (47%): I give a 47% chance that Trump<br />will win the 2024 US Presidential Election.<br />National polls favor Kamala Harris, but those<br />are also unreliable. I really don’t know so I am<br />keeping it close to the middle.","Jessica Armour (46%): Based on recent polls and<br />predictions made, Harris is in the lead to win<br />the election. I decided on 46% because the BBC and<br />website 538 are predicting that he is coming in at<br />about 44-46% of support whereas Harris is leading<br />the majority.","Simon Gersten (85%): Based off current polling<br />and trends, it appears Donald Trump holds a fairly<br />firm grip on the election. He is polling beyond<br />the MOE in significant swing states, and unless<br />things change (they might), he will continue to<br />hold this lead.","Hayden Morehouse (55%): This is going to be<br />a close election and will be decided by swing<br />states. The pollong numbers are constantly<br />changing and the campaign trail is still hot so we<br />will see where this one goes.","Brooke Mcdermott (30%): Polls have been showing<br />Harris leading as soon as she announced that<br />she was running. Additionally, her campaign has<br />fundraised almost twice as much as Trumps through<br />individual donations and fundraising efforts.","Kira Liscombe (45%): Recent polls revealed that<br />Kamala Harris has a national lead of near about<br />3-4 points over Donald Trump. 538 uses polling,<br />economic and demographic data to explore likely<br />election outcomes and ran a simulation on who<br />Is favored to win the 2024 election. Harris wins<br />55 times out of 100 in their simulations and<br />Trump wins 45 times out of 100. Allan Lichtman<br />shared his forecast for the election, in which<br />he pointed out that we are rapidly becoming a<br />majority-minority country and old white guys<br />are on the decline. Kamala foreshadows where<br />our country is going in his opinion, and he<br />predicts she will win the election. Though many<br />acknowledged that it is likely to be a tight<br />race, I saw a high lack of predictions in favor<br />of Donald Trump winning. So, it seems like a less<br />than 50/50 probability of Trump losing, but not<br />certain enough to give him too low of a chance.","Vikram Bharadwaj (64%): Currently Donald Trump<br />has a solid lead in both Ga and Az, polling with<br />around 2 points. He is projected to also gain<br />ground and win NC right now, and with Harris only<br />projected right now to get WI, trump needs either<br />PA or Michigan or NV to win the election. Overall<br />Trump has probably the best chance to win the<br />election since 2016, given how strong his voter<br />base is compared to his competition. Doing the<br />math based on the current projection in polling<br />numbers, trump wis in 84% of universes, but given<br />how subject to change current elections are with<br />the news, I will shift this down to a 64, still<br />more likely than not by a good margin.","Minha Ahmad (51%): The presidential race will most<br />likely come down to seven states, Pennyslvania,<br />Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona,<br />Wisconsin, and Nevada. Right now, Trump is in the<br />majority for three, but is very close to winning<br />Pennyslvania. I think it is likely that Trump will<br />win, however, there is also a chance that Kamala<br />might overcome him in the polls.","Corinne O'Dell (48%): Although this is going to<br />be an extremely tight race, many national polls<br />are calling for Harris to slightly edge out<br />Trump. Harris performs better among mainstream<br />media consumers, while Trump dominates among<br />conservative media followers​. There are several<br />key states that are included in the tough battle<br />for 270 electoral votes. Harris has had mass<br />amounts of attention recently and is appearing to<br />motivate voters.","David Daniels (61%): Currently, there are a few<br />key swing states in play: Georgia (GA), North<br />Carolina (NC), Arizona (AZ), Michigan (MI), Nevada<br />(NV), and Pennsylvania (PA). Based on all the<br />election data I have compiled, it seems that the<br />election will likely be decided by Pennsylvania.<br />At the moment, Pennsylvania is a toss-up in terms<br />of who will win, but historically, Trump has<br />always outperformed his polls. This may be the<br />product of inaccurate polling or nonresponse bias<br />from right-leaning voters. Additionally, I have<br />come across data indicating that more Republicans<br />have registered in the last month compared to<br />their Democratic counterparts. Taking all these<br />factors into consideration, I have arrived at a<br />favorable probability of 61%.","Shayna Van Glish (43%): This is a tough question,<br />as I think that it will come down to one or two<br />states determining the winner of the election.<br />This election is very difficult to predict,<br />as there is a lot of negativity towards both<br />candidates. However, I think that there are more<br />anti-Trumpers than anti-Harrisers so I am giving<br />Trump a 43% chance of winning the election.","Reece Slater (51%): I think it will come down to<br />Pennsylvania. I think Trump takes GA, NC, and AZ,<br />Harris takes WI, MI, NV, then it's just down to<br />Pennsylvania. It's impossible to be very confident<br />for this question, but I will give the very slight<br />edge to Trump.","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): Polling is in favor of<br />Kamala slightly right now.","Erin Ho (48%): Looking over current data on<br />the election and what the polls say about both<br />presidential candidates, I think it’s going to<br />be a tough race. The reason I went below 50% is<br />because Harris has a slightly higher percent of<br />the polls and is seen more favorably in the swing<br />states. That being said, anything can happen and<br />that’s why I’m sitting this close. If I’m being<br />honest; I hate this question.","Abigail Harris (45%): I make no attempts to hide<br />my distaste for polling data having had to both<br />rely on it and collect it, miserable as me and my<br />clipboard were. The data of today exemplifies a<br />great many of my concerns. The most recent data<br />out of Pennsylvania is a fantastic representation<br />of my most common - and loudest - complaints. The<br />margin of error 538 has for that race is around<br />3% with .6% margin in Kamala Harris’ favor.<br />Which to be clear does give her a slight edge<br />but also means absolutely nothing in the long<br />run. So I put my starting number at 50%. I am no<br />more certain Donald Trump will win than Kamala<br />Harris. 270 to win also confirms a less than 1%<br />margin for Harris on Pennsylvania with a larger<br />margin of error. With an opponent that has been<br />leading this state in past months that tends to<br />underpoll, occasionally dramatically, that could<br />spell disaster for a Harris white house, and my<br />Trump prediction. Depressingly unhelpful to say<br />the least. So now for some non-numeric, graciously<br />non-polling based information. Allan Lichtman<br />seems to rather famously corner the market on that<br />particular prediction. What a wonder, 13 simple<br />true or false questions. And like the data I see<br />currently, he gives Kamala Harris an eeked out<br />win. But he also gives her a key for incumbency,<br />something many Americans don’t feel is an accurate<br />statement. Plenty more are willing to acknowledge<br />her role as Vice President is not as powerful as<br />that as a former President, even one who allegedly<br />committed treason. Lichtman’s system is based on<br />incumbency which makes sense, an object in motion<br />will stay in motion until acted upon by an equal<br />or opposite force. As we political science majors<br />know it, incumbency advantage. But incumbency is<br />now disputed, and not on a small scale.","Liv Payne (47%): In order to determine the<br />probability of either candidate winning, I<br />decided to use the data from 270 To Win. Based<br />on the provided poll results from each state, I<br />calculated the number of electoral votes that each<br />candidate would theoretically win in that state.<br />However, some states, such as Alabama, Hawaii,<br />Idaho, etc, did not have data. So I looked at<br />how each state has voted in the past to determine<br />how they would vote this election (thankfully<br />none of the swing states needed this treatment).<br />I ended up with Harris receiving 276 votes and<br />Trump getting 262. This means that, out of 539,<br />Trump will receive 48.6%. This is higher than the<br />46.4% according to the national data, but still<br />relatively close (granted, we are looking at<br />individual polls versus electoral votes, so some<br />change is understandable). Therefore, I estimate<br />his likelihood of winning around 47%, just to<br />round it to a whole number.","Sara Whitmire (46%): I have been semi-obsessively<br />keeping up with this election since Kamala was<br />announced as the Democratic nominee, and I am<br />still hesitant to answer this question with<br />an absolute ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Support for Trump<br />ranges from fanatical to half-hearted, and the<br />Trump campaign has been emphasizing the Biden<br />administration’s failures and associating most of<br />them with Harris, as well as garnering support for<br />issues such as immigration and the economy. The<br />odds of the same party staying in power for two<br />presidential terms in a row are historically low.<br />With that being said, Harris has been strategic<br />about her campaign in swing states, celebrity<br />endorsements, media appearances. Tim Walz and<br />the campaign's messaging about issues such as<br />gun control and international relations appeal to<br />swing voters. I see her campaign as more strategic<br />and as the product of previous Democratic<br />nominees’ successes and failures in relation to<br />Trump, and predict that she will win the popular<br />vote and the electoral college.","Alexis Frazer (55%): While I do believe Kamala<br />Harris will win the popular vote in this election,<br />the election comes down to 8 swing states that<br />trump will most likely be winning the majority<br />of. Voter turn out is the ultimate deciding<br />factor, but based off the present polls, Trump<br />is projected to take hold of PA, GA, NC, and<br />AZ, which would turn the election in his favor.<br />Furthermore, Trump and Pence have been taking more<br />moderate approaches to controversial political<br />matters, such as abortion, which would entice some<br />votes who are on the fence to lean republican.","Colin Barry (58%): While the election is<br />forecasted to be incredibly close, Trump is<br />currently favored in more battleground states than<br />Harris is. This leads me to think that he will be<br />slightly more than likely to win the election as<br />he’s closer to winning more of the swing states.","Rommy Etzion (54%): Harris kind of looks like<br />she’ll get Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and<br />Pennsylvania 6, 10, 15, Trump looks like he might<br />get Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona 11, 16, 16,<br />Pennsylvania i have no clue, I have a feeling<br />towards Trump but it is vital for the blue wall,<br />19 Trump has an advantage over the economy,<br />immigration, and foreign policy and the advantage<br />of not being the previous head of state. Harris<br />is popular for her abortion and race policy, and a<br />strong debate. It will be very close","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (46.5%): We are at a<br />point in the election where either candidate could<br />possibly win. Had Biden stayed in the election,<br />this question would have been a lot easier to<br />answer. I know in class we have talked about the<br />unreliability of polls. Most of these show that<br />Harris is ahead but not by a comfortable margin.<br />I think that anything that happens in October<br />could really determine how the election goes.<br />Personally, I think that the candidate’s response<br />to Hurricane Helene may have switched up some<br />voters. I’m putting a probability of 46.5 because<br />I believe there’s a 53.5 chance Harris wins the<br />election.","Matthew Harvey (40%): I believe that Kamala Harris<br />has done less to alienate independent and voters<br />who were on the fence about both candidates than<br />Trump has. Also I would like to pay homage to<br />Allan Lichtman, a historian who has accurately<br />predicted presidential elections in the past for<br />9/10 times. He does it based upon keys rather than<br />polling data.","William Willis (75%): I believe that Donald<br />Trump has a probability of 75% to win the U.S<br />election. I read an article about Allan Lichtman<br />who has made many correct predictions about past<br />elections. He said that right now it looks like<br />Harris will win but, there needs to be a big<br />event in October for Trump to win. I think that<br />this Hurricane that occurred in Georgia and North<br />Carolina, really put in perspective that Kamala<br />doesn't care about the people. People are slowly<br />starting to realize this. This will give Trump<br />some key swing states.","Haley Ford (18%): Despite a very close race,<br />Kamala has a slight edge in many key states -<br />additionally recent economic conditions (though<br />not necessarily due to Kamala) will be in the<br />democratic party's favor.","Ladi Fashogbon (48%): Trump is facing a slew<br />of legal issues, but has a strong fan base. If<br />economic conditions deteriorate or social issues<br />(like inflation or crime) become dominant, this<br />could play in Trump’s favor as voters may seek a<br />change. He has a just a little less in amount of<br />suporters as harris.","Leo Zegarra (45%): Donald Trump's chances of<br />winning the 2024 presidential election stand at<br />around 45-50%. Polls indicate a tight race, with<br />Trump maintaining strong support in key swing<br />states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. His base<br />remains energized, but ongoing legal challenges<br />and significant opposition make the outcome<br />uncertain. The race could ultimately hinge on the<br />swing voters, who often determine elections in<br />competitive states. Thus, we can expect a close<br />race and it is hard to give more than 5% on either<br />side of the 50%.","John Mathis (40%): He has been steadily losing<br />ground in key battleground AND previously likely<br />Republican states like TX and FL. It’s unlikely<br />that he catches up in these states in my opinion<br />because I think his base is established at this<br />point, but I hedge to 40 because underestimating<br />DJT is how he won in 2016","Edward Tsui (55%): I have narrowed down the<br />key swing states in the electoral college to be<br />Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan,<br />Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada. I have Harris<br />winning Nevada, but I have seen Polymarket's<br />forecast, and it has Trump winning North Carolina<br />and Pennsylvania, by small margins, but Georgia by<br />a significant margin. However, other sources have<br />alluded to a tossup for all three of these states.<br />At this point, this election is a 50-50, and most<br />polling sources are going to have its biases and<br />ideological leans. I'm going to follow the money,<br />and assume that most conservative voters are less<br />vocal about their politics. Both parties have<br />surveying and polling issues, but I''m going to<br />take a wild guess on the older age of conservative<br />voters not reaching polling opportunities as much<br />and assume that Trump may have a slight advantage<br />by a silent, small majority.","Findleigh Ague (35%): Most national polls show<br />Kamala Harris winning, but she only leads with a<br />few percentage points. The ones that show Trump<br />winning also only show a lead by a few percentage<br />points. Something to keep in mind is that many<br />national polls inaccurately predicted Biden’s<br />lead in 2020 and inaccurately predicted Hillary<br />winning in 2016, so they aren’t always full proof.<br />That being said, I just think it’s more likely for<br />Kamala to win, as I feel that people will vote for<br />change, aka someone that hasn’t even the president<br />before.","Gracie Culpepper (48%): This is so 50/50 I truly<br />cannot tell. I think Kamala has a slight edge<br />after the VP debate, but this could change at any<br />time."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":151.23287671232882},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will a New York team win<br />the World Series?","Will China invade Taiwan<br />by December 1?","Will Donald Trump win<br />the 2024 US presidential<br />election?","Will Kamala Harris win<br />the state of Georgia?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3,4],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will a New York team win<br />the World Series?","Will China invade Taiwan<br />by December 1?","Will Donald Trump win<br />the 2024 US presidential<br />election?","Will Kamala Harris win<br />the state of Georgia?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"1270d033739":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"127075e64ee2":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"1270d033739","visdat":{"1270d033739":["function (y) ","x"],"127075e64ee2":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

He could be removed from office, either<br />by Governor Hochul or by a 4/5 majority of a<br />\"committee on mayoral inability\", of which two<br />members are appointed by the mayor. That second<br />one seems wildly improbable. And Hochul has<br />consistently stood by Adams over the past two<br />weeks, strongly signaling that she's unlikely<br />to remove him. The governor herself is quite<br />unpopular (34% approval rating among New Yorkers),<br />and Adams is one of her key political allies.<br />He gave her a valuable endorsement in the 2022<br />governor's race, and the two have worked closely<br />together since. And by the way, who would replace<br />Adams if he were removed from office? NYC Public<br />Advocate Jumaane Williams, her progressive<br />opponent in the 2018 lieutenant governor's race<br />and the 2022 governor's race, and vocal critic of<br />her administration. That leaves us with only one<br />other scenario: Eric Adams resigns. He continues<br />to forcefully profess his innocence, and if the<br />wave of resignations from his administration over<br />the past two weeks hasn't spurred him to resign,<br />it is difficult to imagine what will. Neither<br />the governor and the New York Democratic House<br />delegation are calling on him to resign.

I think the motto<br />applies pretty well to this question. There are<br />a few routes through which Putin could leave<br />power in Russia, but most of them have a tiny<br />per-month hazard rate. There's mortality (about<br />2.5% annually for a 72 year old man). There's<br />popular uprising (about 5% annually? difficult<br />to say). There's military coup (Prigozhin's<br />spectacular failure last year makes this seem<br />particularly unlikely). And there's the off-chance<br />that he travels to Brazil for the G20 summit<br />and is arrested for war crimes (approximately<br />0%).

The point spread<br />is currently of +5 in favor of Texas, so I'm 95%<br />confident the outcome will be somewhere between<br />Georgia losing by 34 points and Georgia winning by<br />24 points.","Joe Ornstein (85%): In a previous prediction,<br />I argued that the Electoral College race is<br />essentially a tossup, though Harris has a slight<br />edge. The national popular vote is somewhat<br />easier to forecast, since national-level polls<br />are historically more accurate than state-level<br />polls. Harris is currently up by +1.6 in the RCP<br />polling average, which translates into a roughly<br />65% chance of winning the national popular vote.<br />This is a pretty back-of-the-envelope calculation,<br />but taking the difference between those two<br />predictions gives us a 10% of Trump winning the<br />Electoral College but losing the popular vote. The<br />reverse outcome---Trump winning the popular vote<br />but losing the Electoral College---seems much less<br />likely, because if Trump overperforms his polls<br />nationally, then chances are he overperforms in<br />key swing states as well, enough to secure the<br />Electoral College.

There are only two possible<br />ways he could be removed: the inability committee<br />or the governor can call for his removal through<br />different mechanisms. The governor said recently<br />as Oct. 10th that she has told Mayor Adams<br />other ways to improve his office, by removing<br />some higher up office support, like the School<br />Chancellor David Banks. Additionally, the only<br />other option is the inability committee. One of<br />the positions on the committee already stated just<br />a few days ago that they will not be reenacting<br />the committee for the purpose of removing Adams<br />because the term \"inability\" refers to literal<br />physical inability to perform as mayor.","Jeffrey Markowitz (60%): The adams administration<br />is in trouble. Alternatives to Eric adams are<br />already seeming to be considered.","Jessica Armour (40%): The amount of effort it<br />would take to remove him from office would be<br />significant and he has made it clear that he<br />does not plan on resigning from office. With that<br />being said I would say it is pretty unlikely that<br />he will resign or be removed from office before<br />December.","Abby Crowe (37%): I predict a 37% chance that Eric<br />Adams will resign or be removed from office before<br />December 1st. I considered the history of indicted<br />mayors, and all of them resigned or were removed<br />following convictions, not in the early stages<br />of trials. Because he has said he won’t resign,<br />and his trial won’t take place until after the<br />deadline.","David Daniels (55%): Many pollsters, about 70%,<br />want Eric Adams to resign. Most of his staffers<br />and board have also quit. There's a growing demand<br />for his resignation, and it seems likely. But Eric<br />Adams has said he won't resign. The market thinks<br />there's a 42% chance he won't resign before 2025.<br />There are rumors of more charges, but it's unclear<br />if they're true. Taking both positive and negative<br />opinions into account, I estimate this probability<br />to be 55%.","Ryan Foley (85%): With the corruption scandal<br />surrounding Eric Adams and his ongoing legal case,<br />it it extremely likely that he will be removed<br />from office. With an ongoing investigation and<br />case against him, he won't be able to properly act<br />as the mayor of New York and will likely be forced<br />to step down. There is a huge amount of evidence<br />against him, and despite pleading not guilty, he<br />won't get off without any punishment. Eventually,<br />the reality should set in for Adams and he will<br />resign.","Erin Ho (57%): As of right now, many New Yorkers<br />are not happy with Adams, and many have called<br />for his removal or resignation. There is major<br />opposition which is the Governor, one of the<br />few in power who can remove him, refraining from<br />making any statements that support his removal and<br />instead wants to give him time to rebuild trust,<br />while the other is that they do not want to form<br />an inability committee, which is another way to<br />remove him. Until there is more information on his<br />accusations, there is no definitive answer.","Kira Liscombe (25%): The New York Times reported<br />that amid calls to resign, Adams has insisted<br />he is innocent and that he is staying in office<br />as New York City’s mayor. He could resign on<br />his own, but his term ends in December 2025.<br />If he is convicted of a felony for a current<br />office he'll have to foreit office, but his trial<br />is likely to be many months away. Its a very<br />complicated process to remove a mayor otherwise,<br />especially during election season. Unless some<br />new information comes out forcing him to resign,<br />i think its pretty unlikely to see any removal in<br />the next couple months.","Vikram Bharadwaj (55%): I feel like this question<br />is the most likely to be a coinflip this semester.<br />It is pretty unprecedented in recent memory for<br />a mayor of a major city to be charged with such<br />serious crimes such as bribery, as well as having<br />much of their administration charged with the<br />same crime. To me, there is a lot of potential<br />for Adams to resign, however I feel as though due<br />to how much he is pushing back there is a great<br />chance he just doesn't resign and fights it in<br />court. People love power and power is something<br />many refuse to let go.","Hayden Morehouse (60%): The mayor was recently<br />indicted on federal bribery charges so he probably<br />should be. However these things take time in court<br />and december 1st is coming up. I think he may step<br />down before then after the public backlash but we<br />will see.","Minha Ahmad (60%): It appears that Adams is<br />getting close to being removed from office. He<br />has plead not guilty for his crimes, however there<br />is still a great amount of evidence proving the<br />crimes he has committed and polls by the New York<br />Times state 69 percent of New Yorkers think he<br />should resign. Due to how public and negative the<br />situation is getting, I believe it is likely that<br />in the next couple of months, Eric Adams may be<br />removed from office.","Colin Barry (60%): I think it is very unlikely<br />that Adams will resign himself and he has made<br />this increasingly clear in recent weeks. However,<br />he is becoming increasingly unpopular in NYC in<br />recent weeks and I do think it is likely as the<br />situation progresses that he will be removed from<br />office by the governor.","Franco Bravo (20%): From several remarks he has<br />made saying that he will not resign, it seems<br />clear that Adams will not give up without a<br />fight. With that in mind, I believe that the legal<br />process of this will take time and not be resolved<br />by Dec 1st","Liv Payne (20%): Adams has made it quite clear<br />that he has no intention of leaving his position,<br />claiming that \"When people say, 'You need to<br />resign,' I say, 'I need to reign.'\" The way to<br />remove a mayor is through the governor, in this<br />case Gov Kathy Hochul, who seems uninclined to<br />remove him. In a private phone call, Hochul urged<br />Adams to remove all of his aids that are caught<br />up in the illicit activities, which Adams has<br />refused. Despite this, many within his circle have<br />either resigned, been charged, or both. It seems<br />that, barring trial, which has yet to be set,<br />Adams will not step down.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (39.5%): Wrote briefing!","William Willis (70%): It seems that Adam’s is<br />very set on not resigning because he has not<br />been guilty of anything that he has committed. A<br />lot of higher up democrats in NYC have been very<br />quiet about him resigning. He seems very keen on<br />not stepping down and doing his job for the city<br />of NYC. I think that he might eventually have to<br />resign but a more thorough investigation will have<br />to occur.","Rommy Etzion (40%): Adams has been charged with<br />federal corruption charges I do not believe Adams<br />will resign on his own, as he took a firm stance<br />against it. Gov. Kathy Hochul or a five-member<br />committee could remove Adams under the city<br />charter, but both processes are complicated and<br />untested, and may extent past the December 1st<br />deadline. There is a some likelihood Hochul will<br />remove Adams, which would possibly help boost<br />her plummeting approval ratings and distance<br />herself from the mayor. That being said a governor<br />hasn’t removed a mayor since 1932, which lowers<br />my percentage. I think it is unlikely to happy,<br />primarily because of the early December 1st<br />deadline. If it was longer my number would likely<br />have been different.","Abigail Harris (28%): I seriously doubt a man like<br />Eric Adams is in any way interested in leaving<br />office via resignation, so with the probability<br />of that smaller question rounded to 0, I was<br />mainly working to answer if i thought he would be<br />removed. So far Gov. Kathy Hochul seems unwilling<br />to try out a largely untested process to remove<br />Adams and says she wants him to prove his ability<br />to lead. Any committee on Mayoral inability<br />(can't believe that's a real thing) would also<br />be unlikely to remove him also bc of the lack<br />of a tested process and it would be made up of<br />his appointees. The question is rather or not it<br />would happen before Dec. 1 if it happens. I think<br />Adams is likely not to receive full force pressure<br />until November when elections are over and he is<br />unlikely to fold to that pressure at any rate.","Sara Whitmire (40%): Eric Adams has pleaded not<br />guilty and has dismissed calls to resign. 69%<br />of New Yorkers have said that they want him to<br />resign, only 30% of respondents think he should<br />stay for the rest of his term, and 63% say that<br />Governor Kathy Hochul should remove him from<br />office. The question of whether or not Hochul will<br />remove him from office is still up in the air. Her<br />low approval ratings could potentially be improved<br />by removing Adams from office, but the move could<br />also adversely affect her standing with her voter<br />base. She is known to be loyal to her political<br />allies, and the process of a governor removing a<br />mayor has never been done before. I think these<br />factors create low odds for this happening by<br />December 1st.","Matthew Harvey (20%): While I believe that is<br />what needs to happen to appeal people, there are<br />several hoops and channels that must be followed<br />in order to remove him from office. The mayor also<br />is pretty adamant that he will stay in office and<br />fight the charges. The governor, Hochul, has the<br />ability to remove him from power, however that<br />is something that has been untested. She is also<br />afraid that without his primary backing, it would<br />hurt her reelection campaign.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): I believe it is highly<br />improbable that Eric Adams will resign from<br />office by December 1st because of his strong<br />stated commitment to finish his term and run for<br />reelection. I also think it is improbable that<br />he will be removed from office by December 1st<br />because 4 out of 5 members on a special council<br />need to rule Adams unfit for office, and 2 of<br />the positions are appointed by Adams himself.<br />Due to Adam's strong commitment to finishing his<br />term and the long process it would take to even<br />successfully remove him, I believe he will still<br />be in office on December 1st.","Shayna Van Glish (35%): I think that the<br />probability that Adams resigns or is removed<br />from office is around 35%. He has expressed the<br />intent to stay in office removing the idea of a<br />resignation. The Governor has yet to start the<br />process for removing him, making it unlikely it<br />will happen by Dec 1.","Alexis Frazer (35%): While Adams is facing<br />pressure to step down from office, I find it<br />unlikely to occur within the next two months.<br />His official trial isn’t until March so if he was<br />going to be removed it would most likely occur<br />after that. Eric Adams put out a statement that he<br />had no intentions of stepping down from office.","Corinne O'Dell (32%): Since the trial is not being<br />held until March, I do not think Eric Adams will<br />resign or be removed from office before Dec 1.<br />He has expressed often that he is not planning on<br />resigning, and him and the governor have already<br />have private conversations that have not resulted<br />in her removing him from office.","Gracie Culpepper (32%): I think if this was going<br />to happen, more than likely it would have already<br />happened. However, I don't want to risk putting it<br />too low which is why I'm saying 32.","Carson Ankeny (30%): New York City is a unique<br />case and they don’t have any built-in processes<br />that could actually lead to impeachment on a city<br />level, and Eric Adams refuses to resign. The only<br />way he can be removed from office is by Governor<br />Kathy Hochul, and I don’t personally think she<br />will remove him. And even if she does, it begins<br />a long and complicated process of dubious legal<br />definitions that Adams would definitely try and<br />fight in the courts, and it also affords him<br />a right to somehow defend himself - the law is<br />pretty unclear. This is Vintage Eric!","John Mathis (27%): There are basically three<br />options that lead to Eric leaving office:<br />resignation, removal by governor, and removal by<br />committee. Eric Adams is insane and has been very<br />public about fighting the charges so I doubt he<br />will resign on his own terms. The Committee, made<br />up of other elected officials, has reportedly<br />said that they are not looking into removing Eric<br />Adams, so that seems unlikely as well. The only<br />reason I don’t put 0 is because of the governor.<br />While they were previously friends, it’s a bad<br />look to have the most important city in your state<br />ran by a criminal, so I balk around 27% I can’t go<br />any lower.","Findleigh Ague (10%): Governor Kathy Hochul has<br />the power to remove Eric Adams from office, but<br />it is hard to say if she will take the actions<br />necessary, especially in the next month and a<br />half. She has proven to be a loyal ally to Adams<br />and has made it clear that their partnership or<br />ally ship is crucial to not just her own success<br />as Governor but will allow for them both to act in<br />their own best interest and that of the residents<br />of NY. She said that she is giving him the<br />opportunity to show both her and all New Yorkers<br />that they are \"righting the ship\" and are working<br />to instill trust in the people, which I think<br />indicates that she won't be taking any serious<br />action right now. There is also a committee that<br />can remove him, but it would be unlikely according<br />to critics because his appointees would have to be<br />involved with removing him.","Haley Ford (25%): The governor is standing by<br />\"innocent until proven guilty\"- and Eric Adams<br />trial date has not been officially set yet.<br />Additionally Adams himself said he would not<br />resign and has stood by his not guilty stance.<br />Although he is the first sitting NYC mayor to face<br />criminal charges, he is not legally obligated to<br />resign and the other way he could be removed is<br />through a committee that is in uncharted waters.","Leo Zegarra (9%): The process for Mayor Eric Adams<br />to be removed from office before December 1st<br />specifically is quite low. Legal and political<br />processes tend to move slowly, and despite facing<br />legal challenges, these cases typically require<br />significant time to resolve. I think that even<br />if charges intensify, immediate removal is not<br />guaranteed given the current timeline and context.","Edward Tsui (30%): I do not think Eric Adams will<br />be removed before Dec 1st.

As of right now, the only thing that could<br />make him back down is if he dies or if something<br />happens during the Russia-Ukraine war that leaves<br />him no choice but to step down.","Gracie Culpepper (100%): Unless he dies before<br />then, I can't imagine a world where this would<br />happen in such a short amount of time.","Kira Liscombe (95%): President Vladimir Putin<br />began his fifth term during May to start six<br />more years as the leader of Russia. Putin has<br />an extremely strong grip on power right now as<br />the presidency has become Russia's most powerful<br />institution. However, his approval ratings are<br />dropping, and Institue Montaigne reported that<br />while in the past, people supported him for<br />his achievements, it has now become clear that<br />they vote for him due to a lack of a decent<br />alternative, a fear of a financial crisis, and the<br />risk of political instability. I explained this<br />more in my brief.","Ryan Foley (95%): Putin has been in power for<br />25 years and has not let his grip on Russia go.<br />He will not resign and doesn't seem to plan to<br />anytime soon so he will likely die in office.<br />Unless Putin somehow is killed or dies of natural<br />causes within the next month, he will remain<br />Russia's leader","Brooke Mcdermott (98%): Leaving during a time of<br />war would be insane, his approval rating is 85%,<br />and elections for this year were held in March,<br />meaning no possibility of him being replaced is<br />going to happen for a few years. Unless there's a<br />sporadic coup or he died, there's no way.","Haley Ford (100%): -length of his power,<br />constitutional reforms expanding his terms,<br />unorganized dissidents, circle around his","Abby Crowe (99.99%): I predict a 99.99% chance<br />that Vladimir Putin will remain the leader of<br />Russia until December 1, and well after. Putin<br />faces little realistic opposition due to his use<br />of fear tactics, the centralized nature of Russian<br />government, and his strategic use of nationalism.<br />Additionally, he has been able to create<br />legislation that allows him to remain in power for<br />longer than initially possible.","Abby Crowe (60%): There are only 5 historical<br />examples of the winner of the national popular<br />vote not winning the Electoral College, 2 of them<br />in modern history. While this race is close, I do<br />not think it is a guaranteed event that we will<br />see this occur. Therefore, I predict a 60% chance<br />that the winner will win both the popular vote and<br />the electoral college.","Hayden Morehouse (98%): This guy doesnt plan on<br />going anywhere unless he essentially gets sick<br />and dies. I don't see anything else happening like<br />that until maybe after December 1st","Franco Bravo (95%): As mentioned in my paper, as<br />long as there is no world impacting or generation<br />defining event, he will indeed still stay in power<br />for the forseeable future, let alone Dec 1st.","Victor Avila (99%): Vladimir Putin has led Russia<br />since his victory in the 2000 election post<br />Yeltsin. Although his recent war in Ukraine has<br />raised the question of when and how Putin will<br />exit the power he's concentrated on for over 2<br />decades, I find it highly likely that he will<br />remain as Russia's leader by December 1st. Russia<br />has recently recaptured a few villages in its<br />western borderlands that Ukraine invaded over<br />the summer, which threatens Ukraine’s leverage<br />to produce a ceasefire. As Russia gains the upper<br />hand in the war, I find the chances of Putin being<br />removed by his oligarch much less likely.","Findleigh Ague (100%): I just don't see anything<br />happening in the next month and a half that would<br />cause Putin to be removed from power. He just won<br />the election earlier this year with 88.48% of the<br />popular vote (whether that's actually reflective<br />of his approval or not), so he's clearly not ready<br />to step down. The only thing that I could think<br />of that would make him want to step down was if<br />he surrendered and removed troops from Ukraine<br />because he would be met with a lot of backlash<br />by the Russian people, but he's not going to<br />surrender, at least not any time soon.There's more<br />than likely not going to be a coup, and I don't<br />think he will be assassinated now either, so I<br />think it is pretty certain that he will still be<br />the leader of Russia on December 1st.","Carson Ankeny (99.9%): Maybe Putin dies. Barring<br />that, he will still be the leader of Russia come<br />December 1st, which is a month and a half away.<br />I don't even think there is any likelihood that<br />Putin is assassinated or killed, the only answer<br />would be natural causes or acute illness. This is<br />highly unlikely to happen.","Jessica Armour (100%): Unless something insane<br />occurs he will continue too be the leader of<br />Russia by December 1. He won the most recent<br />election by 88% which was the highest percentage<br />since post Soviet-Russia. Even when looking up<br />articles for this the majority of them are from<br />2023 and are discussing why Putin's 5th term was<br />almost guaranteed to him. Therefore I think he<br />will remain in power by December 1","Minha Ahmad (97%): It is highly plausible that<br />Putin will still be the leader of Russia by<br />December 1. The most recent election in Russia<br />was in March, and Putin won, effectively being<br />reelected for the next six years. It is highly<br />unlikely that this will change by December 1,<br />however, I am leaving a slight room for error in<br />my prediction in the case that he could possibly<br />be thrown out of office due to his war crimes in<br />Ukraine.","Jeffrey Markowitz (100%): There is almost nothing<br />saying that Putin will not be the leader of<br />Russia. He legally has the authority to stay in<br />office until 2036 and will most likely extend<br />past that. The war with Ukraine seems to be<br />in a stalemate with no peace agreements, and<br />riots/protests are not occuring in russia.","Shayna Van Glish (100%): I am fairly certain that<br />Putin will still be the leader of Russia on Dec<br />1. Putin won 88% of the vote in the elections this<br />past March, giving him power until 2030. I imagine<br />that if he has it his way he will stay in power<br />for a long time...","Leo Zegarra (97%): There's a 97% chance that<br />Vladimir Putin will remain in power by December 1,<br />2024. His ability to control the media, and limit<br />political alternatives reduces the likelihood<br />of any near-term leadership change, barring<br />significant and unforeseen disruptions such as a<br />major internal coup or extreme health issues. His<br />position is largely secure in the current state.","William Willis (99%): I believe that there is a<br />99% probability that Vladimir Putin will still<br />be the leader of Russia on December 1, 2024. The<br />reason I believe that it is 99% is because he was<br />just reelected in the late spring embarking on<br />another six years of power and has more power of<br />Russia than he ever has had before. The reason<br />that he has more power than ever before is because<br />he is entering his fifth term with no opposition<br />in Russia towards him.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (99.99%): First, I<br />thought of what would cause Putin to not be in<br />power. First, I thought of health issues as he<br />is 72. There have been so many rumours about his<br />health from having cancer, a cardiac arrests and<br />Parkinson’s disease. But it appears all is well<br />and those are just rumors. Governmentally-speaking<br />I don’t think Putin will leave office. Then I<br />also thought about the rise of political violence.<br />However, if violence will happen it will probably<br />be against an opponent of Putin and not Putin.","Alexis Frazer (100%): While Putin is in jeopardy<br />with the Russian Ukranian war at the moment, he<br />is still to stubborn to step down from office<br />and has too much power in their governement to be<br />forcibly removed. In January 2020 Putin drafted a<br />constitutional amendment that would allow him to<br />remain president for two more terms.","Edward Tsui (100%): Putin was expected to<br />step down at the end of this year. However, he<br />won reelection by a landslide in March after<br />legislation that allowed him to stay in power<br />until 2036. Thus, by his own neglect of precedent<br />for Presidents serving limited terms in Russia,<br />along with minimal if no opposition to run against<br />him, Putin wouldn't step down before the end of<br />the year. If by the grace of God with the 0.005%<br />chance he did, he would do it after the 1st. The<br />1st has no significance to him, and given his<br />recent actions, I don't think he plans on it. Most<br />betting markets have less than 5 percent for him<br />to step down before the end of the year, and the<br />percentage would shrink if we were to shorten the<br />timeline. Reuters and CNN don't predict he will<br />follow the original guidelines of the Russian<br />Constitution, and even if he were to name a<br />successor, it again wouldn't be before Dec 1st.","Corinne O'Dell (90%): Putin has been in power for<br />over two decades and is widely popular across the<br />country. In the March election, he won over 88%<br />of the vote. Putin is likely to never step down<br />from office, the only other option is a coup or<br />forcible removal, but he is very well protected.","Vikram Bharadwaj (100%): The current political<br />strength that Vladimir Putin has within Russia<br />is immense, making it almost impossible that he<br />would loose power within the next six weeks. Quite<br />literally the only thing that would allow for this<br />to happen would be his death, but I feel like that<br />is quite improbable given how little time there<br />is and the demeanor he has had with recent public<br />appearances.","Colin Barry (100%): Unless there is a crisis or<br />incident within Russia involving Putin, then there<br />is no reason to believe he would not be president.<br />Putin has no direct opposition within the country<br />so there is no reason he would be removed by a<br />political process.","Abigail Harris (100%): Rounding up from 99. With<br />very little news to the contrary, status quo sets<br />a precedent that is unlikely to be changed in<br />a month and a half. Even with Ukraine, there is<br />very little significant push to remove or threaten<br />Putin's power. Putin also has a longstanding<br />history of ensuring there are few others close<br />behind in line to take his place through a various<br />array of methods all of which make his removal<br />less than eminent.","Alex Vrolijk (99%): There is no reason that<br />Putin will be removed or step down from office<br />by December first. I also believe Putin would<br />not want to step down now in the middle of the<br />Russia-Ukraine war. Unless Putin gets removed by a<br />coup or assassination, I believe he will still be<br />leading Russia.","Sara Whitmire (100%): A change in leadership in<br />the midst of a war is unlikely. Russian electins<br />will take place on March 15th, and there aren't<br />any challengers or plans for a post-Putin era.","Matthew Harvey (100%): I believe that there is<br />no doubt in my mind that Vladimir Putin will stay<br />in power for a while. After he was able to add<br />legislation that would give him the opportunity<br />to run for two-six year terms, this essentially<br />guaranteed that he would have a very good chance<br />to maintain power until the 2030's. He has also<br />won the heart of Russia's state and the right<br />people who see Russia as a global superpower. It<br />also helps to mention that political opponents of<br />Putin are scrutinized and most of the time end up<br />taking \"vacations\" or are put in prison.","John Mathis (81%): We always get that this is the<br />year he is finally Ousted. „Things don’t happen“<br />it’s still my primary mantra however, and there<br />are no reports indicating a power shift anytime<br />soon. However, due to the constant rumors I feel<br />like it is still a possibility","Reece Slater (100%): Theres no chance he is out<br />of office by Dec 1. Unless there is some insane<br />accident in which he dies, he will still be in<br />office.","Kira Liscombe (73%): There have been five United<br />States presidential elections in which the<br />successful presidential candidate did not receive<br />a plurality of the popular vote, most recently<br />the 2016 election. This election is already<br />relying on some tight swing state battles, so<br />we could see am outcome similar to how Trump<br />defeated Clinton in 2016 304-227 despite receiving<br />2.8 million fewer popular votes. The Electoral<br />College frames our elections so that there is<br />unequal inflation of representing popular vote.<br />Polling data shows higher chances of Kamala Harris<br />winning the popular vote and swing states such as<br />Pennsylvania, but things can drastically change<br />until the very last minute. Since its rare for<br />this to not occur, but recent elections have been<br />such a toss-up, im predicting a high chance of the<br />popular vote and electoral college lining up but<br />still leaving some room for the unexpected.","Kira Liscombe (38%): We've already seen some<br />disapointed from the UGA team this year, so we<br />will definitley be the underdogs in Saturday's<br />game. Texas is one of college football’s 11<br />undefeated teams and coming off a dominant win<br />last weekend. I personally thought UGA would play<br />much better against MS, but from two years of<br />following this team i know we are not always very<br />predicatble. On top of all of this, its a big<br />home game for UT which automatically puts us at a<br />disadvantage that the Bama game proved we are not<br />good at handling. All of the expert predictions<br />I could find give Texas the advantage. Sports<br />illustrated's model expects a double-digit victory<br />for the Longhorns over the Bulldogs, and betting<br />odds are bad for the Dawgs with Texas at -190 and<br />for Georgia at +160 to win outright. So, although<br />I hate to root against the Dawgs, I see them more<br />likely to lose this game than to not.","Ryan Foley (40%): With how close the electoral<br />college is shaping up to be, it makes sense that<br />the popular vote won't likely reflect its results.<br />With the possibility of Trump pulling in swing<br />states with large democratic cities within them,<br />we could see another situation like in the 2016<br />election. States like Georgia were decided by<br />about 10,000 votes and margins this close greatly<br />increase the chance of a misfire election. While I<br />feel that if Kamala is elected there will be less<br />of a chance of a misfire election, I don't want to<br />rule out the possibility. We know that there are<br />slightly more democratic voters than republicans<br />as well which is why I feel if Trump is elected<br />we have a higher chance of this happening. Overall<br />though, this event is extremely hard to predict as<br />it combines both the outcome of the election and<br />the specific turnout of the state.","Erin Ho (20%): It would be nice to be wrong, but<br />Texas is currently the top team in the NCAAFL<br />going undefeated and Georgia has suffered one<br />loss at ‘Bama. Not to mention, our running back<br />suffered an injury last week and the defensive<br />line has injuries left and right. Overall, many<br />news networks favor Texas as the winners and<br />only a few say Georgia, but this is severely<br />conditional.","Erin Ho (40%): In the history of the US<br />presidential election, there have only been four<br />cases where the winner of the popular vote lost<br />in the electoral college. The only recent case<br />where the margin of loss was large was between<br />Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016, which<br />was nearly three million votes. The race between<br />Harris and Trump is quite close however, and the<br />odds could go either way depending on who wins the<br />popular vote.","Carson Ankeny (65%): Briefing","Carson Ankeny (35%): Arch Manning has a big<br />arm, and the Dawgs haven't looked as dominant<br />as we have in previous seasons. On top of that,<br />we're going to be playing Texas at home. Yikes.<br />I don't have very high hopes of us being able<br />to beat them, but at the end of the day, it's<br />a competitive sport, and anything can happen.<br />A 35% chance to beat the Longhorns seems like<br />a pretty generous but fair prediction. Texas is<br />a very complete team, from offense, to defense,<br />to special teams, and Georgia just can't really<br />compare, especially after performances against<br />Alabama and Kentucky exposed some of the team's<br />weaknesses.","Abby Crowe (30%): As much as it pains me, I give a<br />30% chance that GA beats TX. This is mostly based<br />on betting odds, but I gave the dawgs a little<br />extra because I am a believer. I have never hoped<br />to be more wrong.","Colin Barry (65%): This is a much more desperate<br />Georgia team than we have seen in recent memory,<br />and because of that I think that there is good<br />reason to believe they can pull the upset off.<br />Texas has not been tested by a good caliber team<br />yet while Georgia has, which can mean a lot in big<br />matchups like these in college football.","Jeffrey Markowitz (50%): I believe that this will<br />only be the case if Kamala wins. I think that if<br />Trump wins, it will not be the case. The two are<br />polling almost exactly the same right now.","Colin Barry (43%): Kamala is in firm control of<br />the popular vote so I think that if she wins the<br />election then this is the most likely outcome.<br />However, she is significantly down in most polls<br />as it stands currently so I think that it is<br />slightly less than likely that the winner of the<br />popular vote also wins the electoral college.","Gracie Culpepper (34%): in my briefing, i<br />analyze what fox sports has decided is the best<br />prediction. I also review the stats from both<br />teams this year","Gracie Culpepper (83%): I'm honestly just going<br />off of what I've read on different polling<br />agencies online. I wish I knew how to calculate<br />a number like this myself, but I don't and<br />think trying would probably steer me away from a<br />realistic number.","Hayden Morehouse (40%): To be honest this is a<br />tossup for me so I am just going to put it near 50<br />in hopes of getting one here.","Hayden Morehouse (20%): I would like to say so but<br />our D line has been abysmal and I do not see our<br />secondary being able to gaurd their speedy wide<br />recievers for long enough if we can't pressure<br />the quarterback. It's also in Austin which makes<br />things harder. Hope I am wrong here but.","Liv Payne (95%): Only in fives cases (out of<br />59) has the loser of the popular vote won the<br />electoral college. I considered hedging my bet<br />since it did happen in 2016, but then I found that<br />the last time it happened before that was 2000,<br />and then in the 1800s. Therefore, it seems highly<br />unlikely that it will happen so closely after the<br />most recent time (only 8 years). I feel that it is<br />more likely than 91% (out of 59 elections, 54 of<br />the winners have won the EC and the popular vote),<br />so I increased my likelihood to 95%.","Brooke Mcdermott (30%): Every website I've looked<br />at has been saying they'll lose, though most<br />predictions only say that they'll be a few points<br />apart. Texas hasn't played an SEC team during<br />their season yet, so I think that is one of the<br />bigger obstacles. Some prediction sites gave<br />Georgia a 33% chance of winning , but I decided<br />to decrease it due to the point spread from each<br />teams' individual games against Mississippi State.","Ladi Fashogbon (65%): Historically it always is,<br />there were only three races in which this was not<br />the case. Recent elections have beenunpredictable,<br />so I will lower my probability to 65 percent.","Ladi Fashogbon (40%): Texas is favored to beat<br />us at around 60 percent or slightly over this. We<br />also have only beat them once. Blind faith and our<br />recent track record for the last two months raised<br />my probability 5 percent from 35 to 40.","Liv Payne (32%): According to sports experts<br />(aka not me), Texas is the top rated team in the<br />country this year. They average around 43.4 points<br />per game (making them 7th best in the country),<br />and their defense is number 1 in points and yards<br />allowed (6.3 and 229.7 respectively). Meanwhile,<br />Georgia has an average of 33.5 points per game<br />(35th in the country) and their defense ranks<br />20th in points allowed and 28th in yard allowed.<br />This makes it seem like a clear win for Texas,<br />however some experts are saying that Georgia will<br />be the first \"true test\" of the season (according<br />to Si.com). Based on betting insights from Fox<br />Sports, it seems that the Longhorns have a 66.9%<br />chance of winning (which is actually something I<br />found out after making my initial prediction), so<br />it caused me to raise my probability from 30% to<br />32%.","Brooke Mcdermott (90%): In only 10% of<br />presidential elections has the popular vote and<br />the electoral vote been different results.","Corinne O'Dell (40%): Texas boasts one of the<br />nation's best defenses, allowing just 6.3 points<br />per game, and their offense has been equally<br />impressive, ranking 7th nationally with 43.2<br />points per game. Meanwhile, Georgia's defense<br />has shown vulnerabilities, particularly in their<br />recent game against Mississippi State, where they<br />gave up 31 points. With Texas playing at home<br />and their defense limiting opponents to under 250<br />total yards on average, Georgia is unlikely to<br />come away with a win​.","David Daniels (31%): This forecast was taken<br />straight from the money line. Also Georgia hasn't<br />been looking too hot this season. Losing to bama,<br />almost losing to UK and MSS. Overall I don't have<br />high hopes for this game.","Vikram Bharadwaj (38.5%): Texas is by and far the<br />favorite for winning at home agains the dawgs.<br />Current consensus amongst students here is that it<br />will be a close game. Projection models show Texas<br />winning in 67% of matchups, so I give the dawgs a<br />five percent bump to put it here at 38.5.","David Daniels (40%): As of October 17, Trump is<br />currently leading in all battleground states,<br />according to Real Clear Politics polling. This<br />data suggests that trump is the favored candidate<br />in the 2024 election. However, Kamala Harris is<br />still leading nationally by about 2-3 points.<br />Considering these factors, I believe the most<br />likely outcome is that Trump will win the election<br />without winning the popular vote. Therefore, I<br />estimate a 40% probability that the winner of the<br />Electoral College will also get the popular vote.","Vikram Bharadwaj (40%): Currently Trump leads<br />in at least Ga, Nc, and arizona, with sources<br />conflicting on his leads in other states. The<br />odds of Trump winning at least one of the three<br />wall states (Mich, Penn, or Wis) are effectively<br />a coinflip, of which he only needs to win one.<br />Without a doubt though, Kamala will win the<br />popular vote, so to me this is just a second<br />question of who will win the election.","Franco Bravo (60%): I believe that Kamala will<br />win the popular vote so I also believe that she<br />will also win the presidency as a result. This is<br />because in my opinion Kamala is the overall more<br />popular candidate.","Franco Bravo (30%): I believe that with Texas<br />being the number one country in the nation and<br />UGA lackluster performances, Texas will win in a<br />manner similar to the Alabama game","Simon Gersten (18%): I wrote a briefing for this.","Simon Gersten (77%): Texas' schedule has been very<br />easy thus far and, while they look good, they are<br />playing garbage teams. Georgia, on the other hand,<br />has had a very difficult schedule and has not been<br />playing to the best of their abilities. I believe<br />Georgia will win because the Dawgs are just built<br />like that. We may lose to Alabama, but that's<br />because for some reason Alabama has simply owned<br />us in the past. I expect that to change as well,<br />but I do not believe we will let some average team<br />from Texas come to the SEC and on year 1 dethrone<br />the Champs. This is a hopeful and not science<br />based prediction, but sports are not always based<br />in statistics. Go Dawgs. Horns down. Dawgs by 90","Minha Ahmad (25%): Based on some review of Sports<br />Analytics, I think it is highly unlikely that<br />Georgia football will beat Texas this weekend.<br />According to Sports Illustrated, Texas is<br />projected to win by 76.2 percent.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (33.5%): It is with great<br />sadness that I make this probability. My brain is<br />telling me to go lower, but my hopes, dreams, and<br />optimism is keeping it at 33.5. Typing it feels<br />wrong, I really wish I could put 100 instead.<br />Miracles do happen, but after I submit this I hope<br />they don’t (I need to get a good grade!). I also<br />should mention I looked at betting odds, heavily<br />influenced my decision.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (40%): Last week, Harris<br />was down ~46 and Trump ~48. The numbers are<br />switched now. I honestly don’t know what could<br />possibly happen, but I think it might be something<br />similar to Clinton-Trump in 2016, so that’s why I<br />am going with 40.","Victor Avila (69%): I think the Georgia bulldogs<br />have a pretty good chance at beating the Texas<br />Longhorns this weekend despite UGA having more<br />injuries and Texas has a higher ranking and<br />homefield advantage. The reasoning I think the<br />bulldogs will win is experience in big games.<br />Texas has yet to play against an offensive<br />powerhouse like the bulldogs. The bulldogs have<br />also recently played more ranked teams throughout<br />the season and higher level postseason matchups<br />compared to Texas.","Edward Tsui (37%): Just right of the bat, given<br />that we have discussed multiple related questions<br />to this topic up to this point, I think Kamala<br />will win the popular vote but Trump will win the<br />electoral college, which the EC is ultimately what<br />matters tbh. Kalshi ran an interesting percentage<br />point that the chance Kamala wins both systems is<br />at 41%, and Trump winning both at 27%. The other<br />30% went to Trump winning the EC and Harris the<br />Popular. I pursued other sources to test these<br />numbers legitimacy. There have only been 5 times<br />in history where the EC and Popular vote have not<br />matched up, and these years are 1824, 1876, 1888,<br />2000, and 2016. Obviously 2016 was Trump's odd<br />year, so that plays a role in the predictability<br />of replicating results similarly this time around<br />with him being the nominee again. 538 has Kamala<br />leading in polls, but key battleground states show<br />a Republican lean also via 538. 270 to win and<br />Real Clear polling show a similar trend except<br />with Pennsylvania. Nick Anderson also has Trump<br />winning the EC by 55% but Kamala winning the<br />Popular vote.","Edward Tsui (32%): Convert the Moneyline with<br />sports betting or the spread, and you get<br />somewhere from 36-38% chance Georgia beats Texas<br />on Saturday. Sports illustrated ran simulations,<br />and they said Georgia has a 23.8% chance. I am<br />going to go with 32. Draftkings rep choose UGA<br />based on explosive offenses on both sides, but I<br />do not believe in the Georgia secondary preventing<br />a Ewers led offense. I am gonna follow the money<br />and say Texas wins it. Vegas doesn't lose with the<br />spread, but I might lose regardless of the cover.","Alex Vrolijk (37%): There are many reasons why I<br />think it is unlikely that Georgia will beat Texas<br />this weekend. One of the reasons is that it is an<br />away SEC game and a big one at that. Playing away<br />in the SEC is difficult no matter who you play,<br />Alabama lost at Vanderbilt, Tennessee at Arkansas,<br />Ole Miss at home against Kentucky, all top 6 (at<br />the time) vs unranked opponents. There are also<br />injuries, performance inconsistencies, coaching,<br />stadium atmosphere, and players to consider.<br />Despite Georgia fans' ability to travel well to<br />away games, I do not think we will beat Texas.","Alex Vrolijk (60%): I think it is almost certain<br />that the democratic party will win the popular<br />vote regardless of whether or not they win the<br />Electoral College as previous election trends has<br />shown as such (betting odds heavily favor Kamala).<br />The winner of the electoral college is a much<br />more difficult prediction as they are within the<br />margin of error in most polls and exit polls are<br />yet to be posted from those who have voted early.<br />Even though it is a very close race I believe<br />Kamala will squeeze out in front securing both the<br />electoral college and the popular vote.","Abigail Harris (25%): I still know nothing about<br />sports. But I know when Vegas puts a negative<br />two hundred two next to Texas’ name it means you<br />shouldn’t bet on the Dawgs. Every power ranking or<br />evaluation I saw favored Texas heavily, the Vegas<br />standard is 4.5 points right now. The dawgs have<br />had a shaky season already and with a loss under<br />our belt Texas is expected to be number one when<br />they face us. I may not love our odds, but they’re<br />low.","Haley Ford (38%): Spread as seen on<br />Sportline/using the markets to predict this one","Abigail Harris (36%): Kamala Harris will almost<br />certainly have to win the popular vote to win the<br />electoral college. Donald Trump doesn’t have the<br />same problem. For Trump, large urban centers with<br />population density aren’t voting for him. Hillary<br />beat him by 2.8 million votes in 2016 and still<br />lost because many of them were in safe states like<br />NY and CA. The electoral college gives votes to<br />land, not people. As such, it tends to favor the<br />conservatives that win in less urban areas.","Haley Ford (52%): Democrats seem likely to win<br />popular vote, so I am taking this as similar to<br />Kamala winning the election","Alexis Frazer (30%): With the unpredictable ways<br />UGA has been playing recently and the stability<br />of UT, there is reason to believe UT will win.<br />However, we can hope that because UT hasn’t played<br />any serious team this season that they’ve gotten<br />lucky with their schedule. They also have the home<br />court advantage.","Alexis Frazer (40%): Going off of my prior<br />prediction, I think Trump will win the electoral<br />college but Kamala will win popular vote. If<br />Harris wins she would most likely get popular<br />vote and electoral college. The election is kind<br />of a toss up right now but most swing states are<br />leaning in Trumps direction so he will most likely<br />win electoral college.","Matthew Harvey (60%): I believe that Kamala is<br />wiinning currently in many of the battle states.<br />I also believe this year you will see a massive<br />turnout for democrats this election due to high<br />stakes issues. It is also widely understood<br />that Democrats generally win the election, and<br />specifically in this election and case, Trump's<br />favorables are not near as popular in comparison<br />with Kamala's. Trump has done plenty to alienate<br />the constituency of the United States.","Matthew Harvey (28.4%): I wrote a briefing on this<br />question and concluded that there would almost<br />have to be a perfect storm of events for the<br />Bulldogs to beat the Longhorns. The past games UGA<br />has played, only 1 has left me confident that the<br />Bulldogs have what it takes to play and maintain<br />a lead well. The Longhorns are firing on all<br />cylinders with a great start qb and a wonderful<br />secondary seeking to prevent the dogs from any<br />explosive plays.","Findleigh Ague (48%): In the past, an elected<br />president has lost the popular vote on five<br />different occasions, with the most recent being in<br />2016. From poll results of the last week, Fox News<br />and NBC are the only ones that favor Trump (with<br />NBC's results including votes for third-party<br />candidates), and Marquette NBC's poll with only<br />Harris vs. Trump and Yahoo have them tied. The<br />rest of the polls all favor Harris by at least one<br />percentage point. While this isn't a huge margin,<br />it just tells us that as we get even closer to<br />the election, the race is still extremely close.<br />It's still so hard for me to say who is actually<br />going to win, but I think it's possible that the<br />winner of the popular vote and the winner of the<br />electoral college are not the same candidate.<br />I have said in previous forecasts that I think<br />Harris is more likely to win, so if I'm sticking<br />with that, I feel like it wouldn't be surprising<br />to see Trump winning the popular vote. Something<br />to note about the polls in 2016 is that many<br />predicted a relatively significant margin between<br />Clinton and Trump the week of the election, which<br />is also true of the polls from this week that<br />include third-party candidates (same as the ones<br />I looked at from 2016). If these trends followed<br />suit with 2016, then Harris would win the popular<br />vote, and Trump would win the Electoral College.<br />I'm not sure that will happen because we're not<br />dealing with quite the same situation, but I think<br />that something similar could possibly happen.","Reece Slater (45%): I think that this question<br />directly correlates with the \"who will win the<br />presidential election\" question. I think if Harris<br />wins, she also wins the popular vote. I think if<br />Trump wins, he loses the popular vote. Given that<br />I predicted Donald Trump to win the election, I<br />must give this question slightly less than 50, as<br />if he wins, he will not win the popular vote in my<br />opinion.","Sara Whitmire (68%): 48 states have a<br />'winner-takes-all' system for Electoral College<br />votes, and although electoral college voters don't<br />always stick with the votes of their state, for<br />the most part they do. The popular vote has lost<br />to EC votes a total of 5 times in US history,<br />in recent history to elect Republican presidents<br />George W Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016. If Trump<br />wins the popular vote and the EC votes in Harris,<br />there will be basically no historical precedent,<br />as the EC usually works in favor of electing<br />Republicans. However, the whole 'threat to<br />democracy' thing is also unprecedented, so I could<br />see this happening.","William Willis (40%): Wrote a brief- If Kamala<br />wins she will get the popular vote but if trump<br />wins he will not get the popular vote","Jessica Armour (75%): As of right now the<br />predicted Electoral College seems to align<br />with the national popular vote. During the last<br />Presidential Election, President Biden won the<br />electoral college as well as the national popular<br />vote, therefore I think it is very likely that the<br />winner of the national popular vote will also win<br />the electoral college.","Findleigh Ague (25%): UGA has played Texas 5<br />times and has only won once. Texas is also 6-0<br />so far this season and is currently #1 while we<br />stand at #5. According to Sports Illustrated,<br />about 53% of bettors for this game favor Texas,<br />and computer-generated models like the College<br />Football Power Index predict Texas winning 76.2%<br />of the 20,000 simulated games. UGA also just<br />hasn't been having the greatest season. Maybe this<br />could be fuel for them for the game tomorrow, but<br />after losing to Alabama and letting Mississippi<br />State score 31 points in the game last weekend,<br />I don't think it's looking that great. Maybe they<br />didn't have their first string players out for an<br />unranked team and that could explain that, but I<br />had a lot of hope for them beating Bama, and they<br />did not, so I feel as though it's probably going<br />to be the same deal here. Especially because Texas<br />is a stronger team than them as well. I still gave<br />them some hope though out of school spirit. Horns<br />down.","Jeffrey Markowitz (55%): Discussed in class","William Willis (20%): I feel that there is a 20%<br />probability that UGA defeats Texas this weekend. I<br />feel that UGA has looked very flat all year and a<br />rivalry game is not going to help. Texas is a lot<br />more discipline than UGA this year. Also Texas has<br />a healthy roster and the whole team is foaming at<br />the mouth for a national championship.","Corinne O'Dell (45%): This has happened in several<br />elections, most notably in 2000 and 2016. This<br />could occur if a candidate secures large margins<br />of victory in populous states like California,<br />New York, or Illinois, boosting their popular<br />vote total. However, they could still lose in key<br />battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia,<br />or Arizona, which collectively carry a significant<br />number of electoral votes.","Leo Zegarra (41%): With current betting odds<br />showing Texas as a -200 favorite and Georgia at<br />+175, I give UGA about a 41% chance of pulling off<br />a win on Saturday. Because Texas is favored to win<br />and betting against Vegas doesn't usually tend to<br />be correct, I believe, sadly, that Texas will get<br />the best of us.","Minha Ahmad (47%): Currently Trump is winning<br />in the toss up/battleground states, however on a<br />national level, he is slightly losing. Also, as<br />for electoral votes, the Democrats are ahead.","Sara Whitmire (45%): We are so cooked, dude.<br />Texas is undefeated this season, and our receivers<br />literally dropped the ball in our Bama game.<br />They're a 4.5 point favorite to win, and it's<br />at Texas, so there's a homefield advantage. I<br />was optimistic that we would be undefeated this<br />season, but my dreams was crushed. -_- However...<br />I feel like we do well under pressure, and we defy<br />the odds sometimes, so I'll adjust my prediction<br />accordingly. Plus, we've technically only lost one<br />game and we're ranked 5th. I'm conflicted! Gah.","Jessica Armour (40%): Sports Illustrated says<br />that the odds are in favor of Texas winning. Also<br />Georgia already has been defeated this season,<br />whereas Texas has not. Therefore, it is more<br />likely that Texas will win the game considering<br />the good season they have been having so far.","John Mathis (80%): it is incredibly unlikely for<br />Harris to carry only one of the votes and win,<br />meaning that if she wins, the popular vote winner<br />will almost certainly also be Harris. On the other<br />hand, there is quite a few scenarios in which<br />Trump wins the election but loses the popular<br />votes. In fact, Trump has never won the popular<br />vote. This makes me feel fairly confident that if<br />Trump wins, there is a large chance he does not<br />win the popular vote. Given this information, the<br />question essentially boils down to who I think<br />will win the election. If Harris, then there is<br />an approximately 95% chance (in my opinion) that<br />she also carries the popular vote. If Trump, I<br />would say there is about a 45% chance he wins the<br />popular vote. Given that I believe that Kamala has<br />a higher chance of winning this election, I will<br />weight that 95% and put my prediction at at 80%<br />chance that the electoral college winner will also<br />carry the popular vote.","Reece Slater (31%): ESPN Analytics currently has<br />Georgia at a 23.8% chance of winning. It will be<br />very difficult to beat Texas given their success<br />this season, and our obvious struggles. Most<br />sports books have Texas favored by 4 or 5 points.<br />If we play a full game from kickoff with limited<br />mistakes, we can certainly compete with them,<br />though I feel it is fairly unlikely we beat them.","John Mathis (40%): Georgia has struggled with<br />worse teams and Texas has much better wins under<br />their belt. Georgia has been struggling since<br />Alabama to find their footing, and I think overall<br />it will be too much for them against number one<br />Texas. Its certainly going to be a close game,<br />however, so I am hedging to 40 percent chance.","Leo Zegarra (67%): Based on the odds that I gave<br />previously including the odds that Trump wins<br />presidency, there's about a 67% chance that the<br />winner of the national popular vote will also win<br />the Electoral College. This prediction considers<br />that if Kamala Harris wins, there's a really high<br />chance, a 90% chance, that she'll also win the<br />popular vote, while Donald Trump only has a 38%<br />chance of winning the popular vote if he secures<br />the presidency. Combining these probabilities<br />suggests a strong likelihood of alignment between<br />the popular vote and the Electoral College<br />outcome."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Georgia football<br />defeat Texas on Saturday?","Will New York City mayor<br />Eric Adams resign or<br />be removed from office<br />before December 1?","Will the winner of the<br />national popular vote<br />also win the Electoral<br />College in the November<br />US presidential election?","Will Vladimir Putin be<br />the leader of Russia on<br />December 1?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3,4],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Georgia football<br />defeat Texas on Saturday?","Will New York City mayor<br />Eric Adams resign or<br />be removed from office<br />before December 1?","Will the winner of the<br />national popular vote<br />also win the Electoral<br />College in the November<br />US presidential election?","Will Vladimir Putin be<br />the leader of Russia on<br />December 1?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"12704f3c20c6":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"1270107541f4":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"12704f3c20c6","visdat":{"12704f3c20c6":["function (y) ","x"],"1270107541f4":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I don't<br />really see it. The only way that it translates<br />into a ceasefire is if it prompts the United<br />States and other European allies to insist on a<br />ceasefire as a condition for continued arms sales.<br />I see little chance of that happening before<br />the US presidential election, and zero chance<br />afterwards if Trump is elected. If Harris is<br />elected and Biden chooses to devote the following<br />two months to a serious effort at securing a<br />ceasefire, then maybe? The expansion of the war<br />to Lebanon provides Netanyahu an opportunity to<br />declare victory in Gaza without losing the support<br />of his coalition partners, but the terms that<br />Israel would ask for in a ceasefire (a continued<br />occupation of Gaza and Israeli troops securing the<br />Egyptian border) seem like non-starters for the<br />remaining leadership of Hamas.","Joe Ornstein (1%): No, right? Both the House and<br />Senate versions of these bills have plenty of<br />cosponsors and are currently in committee, but<br />neither has been reported out of committee, much<br />less scheduled for a floor vote. Congress will be<br />in session less than two weeks in November after<br />the elections, and I see no indication that this<br />is a bill where there's a sense of urgency to get<br />it passed. Maybe I know less about Congressional<br />procedure than I think I do, but it seems<br />extremely unlikely that this will happen before<br />the next Congress.","Joe Ornstein (25%): The 2020 US presidential<br />election saw record-high voter turnout (66% of<br />VEP, higher than any election since 1908!). I<br />hesitate to attribute this *entirely* to COVID-19,<br />since the 2018 midterm *also* saw record-high<br />turnout (50% of VEP, highest since 1914). Trump's<br />presence in an election mobilizes voters---on both<br />sides---in ways that are historically anomalous.<br />The number of registered voters is generally<br />the strongest predictor of how many people will<br />turn out to vote, and in nearly every state I've<br />looked at the share of the VEP that is registered<br />is either hovering around 2020 levels or higher.<br />So those are reasons to expect higher turnout<br />rates this year. All that said, the pandemic-year<br />permissiveness around absentee balloting increased<br />the share of registered voters who cast a ballot<br />beyond what one would normally expect, so there's<br />ample reason to expect some regression to the mean<br />in 2024, now that those policies are no longer in<br />place."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,0)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.20000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.23000000000000001,0.02,0,0.070000000000000007,0.02,0.14999999999999999,0,0.14999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.050000000000000003,0,0.02,0.33299999999999996,0.001,0,0,0.01,0.050000000000000003,0.040000000000000001,0.025000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0,0.01,0.029999999999999999,0.050000000000000003,0,0.0050000000000000001,0.11,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.029999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.02,0,0.5,0.050000000000000003,0,0.050000000000000003,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.059999999999999998,0,0.14999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.070000000000000007,0,0.40000000000000002,0.001,0,0.01,0.050000000000000003,0.10000000000000001,0.050000000000000003,0.059999999999999998,0.10000000000000001,0.02,0.10000000000000001,0,0.17000000000000001,0.050000000000000003,0.29999999999999999,0.45000000000000001,0.84999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,0.17999999999999999,0.17999999999999999,0.70999999999999996,0,0.435,0.27000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.55000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.25,0.62,0.37,0.26000000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.54000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.54000000000000004,0.59999999999999998,0.90000000000000002],"y":[1.9950459694722666,2.0340952323283998,1.9584988332586364,2.0421302425442263,2.0214445364894345,2.0079500015359373,1.9714081892278046,2.0459362648427488,1.9727724727941678,0.95546907982788976,1.9841155034722759,2.0292034602491187,1.9711323946481571,1.9727948147570715,1.9891903964802622,1.9916527643101289,1.9877012336626649,2.0033552754204722,2.0329174430342389,2.000721672223881,2.0259430991485714,1.9527414224576205,2.0308568149106576,2.0414491304196418,2.0248606675304472,1.995430434984155,2.0020503487205135,2.0362799541559071,1.9967624527867884,2.0078434292692693,1.9670909221749753,1.9759180190041661,1.9536209033569321,1.0210435601184145,1.0343554639723151,0.96401993560139088,0.95085361499804999,0.98457137185614552,0.95233259105589241,0.9622558284550905,0.99213340037968012,0.9688835692591965,1.0422457945067436,0.98092898977920417,0.9867974194232374,0.98106774648185824,0.98664785157889123,1.0457605165196582,1.007546235411428,1.0416146846488119,1.0096995162311941,0.95780591343063859,0.96371930306777354,0.95550746831577271,0.9661969506880268,1.0199378945631907,1.0214953363174573,1.0476947392104194,0.96975618358701465,0.99424233599565925,0.99026041731704029,0.95763305220752959,1.0495306412922218,0.96179776221979407,0.95836680529173468,1.0491487398510799,2.9698383223032581,2.9903376564383506,2.995275597809814,3.0236123624024911,2.9552725778194144,2.9833734169835227,2.9918323377845808,3.0110923923552035,2.9950940418755634,3.0133577262982727,2.977420867141336,3.0019522151211278,2.9528841216349972,2.9868995737517254,2.9699266375740989,3.0267921383492649,2.9559413164854051,3.00016012347769,2.9877200951566918,2.994217615877278,2.991154249571264,2.9918952765408902,2.9546350072603671,2.994643739797175,3.048796901269816,3.0007982837734746],"text":["Ryan Foley (20%): With the expansion of the<br />war in the Middle East into Lebanon, I find it<br />increasingly unlikely that the war will come to<br />an end anytime soon. Bringing more players into<br />the war, especially ones that back up Palestine,<br />creates an environment of lasting conflict for<br />Israel. The war has recently reached its 1-year<br />mark and Israel continues to push into Gaza,<br />killing civilians. Despite the recent death of<br />one of Hamas' military leaders, the group does<br />not seem to be conceding either. With both groups<br />committed to the war, outside forces will likely<br />be the only factors that could bring about a<br />ceasefire so soon. Unless the US drastically<br />changes its stance on the war, I don't see<br />anything changing at least until after the<br />election.","Brooke Mcdermott (10%): Briefing","Abby Crowe (23%): I predict a 23% chance that<br />Israel and Hamas agree to a ceasefire before<br />December 1st. The odds in my opinion are low but<br />not impossible, as the focus has shifted slightly<br />to Lebanon, the leader of Hamas was recently<br />killed, and neither party are willing to adjust<br />their demands.","Liv Payne (2%): With Sinwar's death, Hamas has<br />been dealt a serious blow by Israel. However, many<br />posit that neither Hamas nor Israel will accept a<br />ceasefire without the other accepting their terms.<br />Hamas wants Israel's complete withdrawel from<br />Gaza, and Israel wants Hamas' totalm surrender.<br />This seems unlikely, so I put my probability very<br />low.","David Daniels (0%): The timeliness of this<br />forecast seems to be one of the bigger factors on<br />this matter. With an upcoming election I find it<br />somewhat unlikely that anything will happen prior<br />to a newly seated president. Additionally, It<br />looks like the Israel-Hamas conflict is currently<br />ramping up rather than dying down. These factors<br />considered, I believe the probability of a cease<br />fire before December to be low, closer to zero<br />than any other whole number. That being said I<br />assign a 0% probability.","Erin Ho (7%): Both Israel and Hamas have certain<br />terms they want, but neither are willing to<br />back down in negotiations. There are many issues<br />blocking the way for a potential ceasefire, not<br />a humanitarian pause, like the hostage situation<br />or wanting what’s best for their countries. Also,<br />a ceasefire goes against everything Netanyahu has<br />preached about when going against Hamas. There’s<br />no way he’s letting them out alive.","Vikram Bharadwaj (2%): Currently, even with the<br />death of the orchestrator of the October 7th<br />attacks, Israel shows no sign of slowing down<br />their advancement in Gaza, or their advancement<br />into Lebanon. History has shown that the death<br />of leaders, particularly those of NSA, often<br />aggravates said organization making it extremely<br />unlikely that any such ceasefire would be agreed<br />upon. I find it more likely that some sort of<br />surrender agreement is reached before a ceasefire<br />is called.","Jeffrey Markowitz (15%): There is no sign of<br />this happening. Israel has eliminated virtually<br />all of Hamas's leadership, however Netanyahu<br />has said that this war is still going to occur.<br />With Hamas and Netanyahu on completley different<br />terms about what they want, including the refusal<br />to return the hostages and Netanyahu's refusal<br />of a two-state solution, as well as a complete<br />failure from allied countries to mediate ceasefire<br />efforts, there seems to be no end in sight to this<br />war.","Ladi Fashogbon (0%): All of Netanyahu's platform<br />is destroying hamas and there is no intention<br />of a ceasefire. If there was any indication this<br />would happen in less than two months from now, it<br />wouldve already been shown.","Ladi Fashogbon (15%): the bill called the Treat<br />and Reduce Obesity Act of 2024 was introcued<br />to congress in june and there has been no other<br />updates since august. The current session of<br />Congress ends on January 3, 2025. Any bills<br />not signed into law by then will need to be<br />reintroduced in the next Congress so it is<br />extremely unlikely.","Minha Ahmad (20%): There have been several<br />attempts made for a ceasefire deal, such as in<br />July, Hamas had agreed to sign for a temporary<br />ceasefire, however, these attempts have been<br />consistently rejected by Netanyahu. Even UN<br />Security Council has called for a ceasefire in<br />Gaza, which elicited no response from Israel.<br />Netanyahu has been unwilling to agree to a<br />ceasefire, so I highly doubt that this will occur<br />before December 1st.","Alex Vrolijk (5%): Netanyahu will do practically<br />anything to not get a ceasefire. The US also<br />places no pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire.<br />Israel has also expanded its fighting to other<br />countries like Lebanon so it seems unlikely that<br />they stop in Gaza soon either. IDF killed Hama's<br />political leader Ismail Haniyeh in July who was<br />responsible for ceasefire negotiations. Despite<br />Yahya Sinwar's death, I don't think Israel's<br />attitude will change.","Corinne O'Dell (0%): A ceasefire between Israel<br />and Hamas before December 1, 2024, appears<br />unlikely based on the current situation. While<br />there have been multiple efforts to mediate<br />a ceasefire, including proposals involving<br />prisoner exchanges and humanitarian aid, Israel’s<br />leadership has expressed reluctance to halt<br />its military operations in Gaza. Prime Minister<br />Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel is only<br />open to partial ceasefires that do not end the<br />conflict entirely.","Alexis Frazer (2%): With ongoing hostilities and<br />political pressures, it is unlikely for either<br />side to back down in the near future. Even with<br />Simar’s death, the two sides have not initiated<br />any efforts to decrease conflict. The war began in<br />early October 2023 and for it to resolve prior to<br />December is unlikely.","Rommy Etzion (33.3%): View briefing :)","Colin Barry (0.1%): I do not think there is enough<br />time left in the span ahead of December 1st for<br />a ceasefire to be organized. Even if there was, a<br />ceasefire does not advance the goals of Israel and<br />would be unlikely to be organized.","Corinne O'Dell (0%): A ceasefire between Israel<br />and Hamas before December 1, 2024, appears<br />unlikely based on the current situation. While<br />there have been multiple efforts to mediate<br />a ceasefire, including proposals involving<br />prisoner exchanges and humanitarian aid, Israel’s<br />leadership has expressed reluctance to halt<br />its military operations in Gaza. Prime Minister<br />Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel is only<br />open to partial ceasefires that do not end the<br />conflict entirely.","Abigail Harris (0%): With Benjamin Netanyahu<br />likely to remain in power and all of his<br />supporters being very pro Israel in terms of<br />the ‘land disputes’, it only makes sense. This<br />conflict has been around almost as long as the<br />Southern Levant itself and with the American<br />election both candidates have committed themselves<br />to supporting Israel’s right to ‘defend’ itself<br />with the continued support of bombs and other<br />weapons.","William Willis (1%): I have a come up with a<br />1% likelihood of Israel and Hamas to agree to a<br />ceasefire before December 1. The reasons that I<br />have come up with that number is because of Hamas,<br />Israel, and Haezbollah have demands that each<br />nation can’t be able to agree to. Netanyahu has<br />made it clear that he doesn’t only want a “total<br />victory” over Hamas but also to bring back the<br />residents of the North.","Victor Avila (5%): I think the chances that Hamas<br />and Israel agree to a ceasefire before December<br />1st are incredibly low. Many factors went into<br />this forecast, and tipped the boat in certain<br />directions. Recently, Biden gave Netanyahu 30 days<br />to improve the conditions in Gaza which initially<br />skewed the favor in direction towards a ceasefire.<br />But when looking at the grand scheme of things,<br />Netanyahu has not listened to a thing that Biden<br />or Harris has said in regards to improving the<br />conditions in Gaza, so I took this with a grain of<br />salt. Israel also just killed Hamas leader Sinwar,<br />which could also lead to a ceasefire. I did not<br />believe this as Netanyahu stated, \"the war has<br />just begun\".","Sara Whitmire (4%): Although the leader of Hamas<br />has been killed, a ceasefire remains unlikely due<br />to the characteristics of leaders on both sides<br />as well as the complex nature of the conflict as a<br />whole. The odds of this being resolved within the<br />next few months are incredibly low.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (2.5%): Yahya Sinwar's<br />death could reopen ceasefire negotiations.<br />According to US officials, Sinwar was blocking<br />ceasefire negotiations. However, this is a recent<br />development, so neither Hamas or Israel have<br />spoken about a possible ceasefire. Netanyahu<br />stated that Sinwar's death did not signal the<br />end of the war, and their recent incursion into<br />Lebanon further shows that. Some experts state<br />that Hamas’ leadership might be in fear, and<br />therefore, they might concede some of their<br />demands for a ceasefire. I just don’t know how<br />soon this can happen.","Franco Bravo (20%): I believe that as long as<br />Netanyahu remains in power and still sort of<br />has US support, that Israel will keep the battle<br />going on their end. Furthermore if I remember<br />correctly there is an agreement set to go in place<br />relating Israel and UN forces that ties in the US<br />aswell relating with arm support. This is is just<br />something I believe will only stop probably after<br />the presidential election","Simon Gersten (15%): With Hamas being a dangerous<br />terrorist group that is holding Israeli hostages,<br />a ceasefire will be difficult to agree upon. Hamas<br />refuses to release the hostages and end this war<br />that they started and are getting destroyed in.<br />The only way the war ends is if Israel eliminates<br />all current and potential Hamas leaders.","Jessica Armour (20%): Israel is very unlikely to<br />agree to the terms and conditions of ceasefire.<br />As of August 2024 they had been working on an<br />agreement for the past nine months, therefore I<br />see it being very unlikely that they will be about<br />to come to terms within the next two months.","Findleigh Ague (0%): Netanyahu does not want a<br />ceasefire, and I doubt that he will concede and go<br />back on his stance. There was a four-day ceasefire<br />last November, but Israel never wanted it to be a<br />means of ending the war, hence why it ended. From<br />Hamas’s standpoint, their leader was just killed,<br />and even though they agreed to the Egyptian-Qatari<br />ceasefire proposal earlier this year, they have<br />now stated that they will only release hostages<br />if Israel agreed to a ceasefire. Tensions are<br />high right now, so I don’t think there will be a<br />ceasefire by December 1st.","Carson Ankeny (1%): There’s just no real reason<br />for Israel to agree to one. The conflict is still<br />actively ongoing, and negotiating doesn’t seem<br />like something that anyone is too interested in<br />right now.","Leo Zegarra (3%): The chances of Israel and Hamas<br />agreeing to a formal ceasefire before December 1<br />are rather extremely low. Israeli Prime Minister<br />Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel’s<br />military operations will continue until its<br />objectives are met, which include eliminating<br />Hamas' capabilities.Because of this and due to the<br />nature of the conflict and Hamas' own resistance<br />to ceasefire agreements, a formal ceasefire is<br />highly unlikely. Humanitarian pauses may occur,<br />but a publicly recognized ceasefire remains out of<br />the question with the time frame given.","John Mathis (5%): As discussed during the<br />Netanyahu question, Benjamin essentially needs<br />to continue the war in order to remain prime<br />minister and avoid jail. Furthermore, the Biden<br />administration has said that it’s time for a<br />ceasefire, but it seems like one with Lebanon is<br />more within the realm of possibility than in gaza,<br />so I think that is where most resources will go to<br />negotiate peace rather then in Gaza.","Matthew Harvey (0%): I believe that both sides are<br />not going to see a viable solution to the problem<br />in the timeframe provided. This war has lots of<br />historical context and therefore will take long<br />thought over solutions. I also know that ending<br />the war is not in Benjamin Netanyahu's favor as<br />by doing so, it takes Israel's attention away from<br />foreign issues and back on the domestic issues.<br />This puts him back in the limelight and under the<br />hot seat again.","Edward Tsui (0.5%): Israel and Hamas have varying<br />goals. This is best suited with an analogy. Two<br />neighboring dogs have a long history of beef and<br />do not do well trying to coexist. The weaker dog<br />eventually snaps on the other. They fight for<br />a while. Now, the original aggressor is now the<br />docile dog on its back in submission while the<br />other still want to go in for the kill. Israel<br />is the dog who still wants to go in for the kill.<br />Until Netanyahu can abandon this goal that he<br />has taken as a part of his leadership identity,<br />the war will continue until allying countries<br />eventually pull funding from both sides or one<br />eradicates the other. Eradication really only<br />goes one way, especially since Israel killed<br />Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar recently. Basically a<br />ceasefire is unlikely before the election or by<br />December 1st, but even then, one party desires<br />to completely annihilate the other parties entire<br />existence. The territory in dispute is desired<br />by groups, so a withdrawal or give up of this<br />territory is non negotiable for both sides. One<br />group just wants to claim to stop war but get what<br />they want as well. Both sides suck at negotiating.","Reece Slater (11%): Even with the death of Sinwar,<br />I don't see this war ending before Dec 1 through a<br />ceasefire. Netanyahu seems to have no interest in<br />a unilateral ceasefire, and instead wants Hamas to<br />basically surrender. His requests in negotiation<br />do not favor an equal ceasefire, as he still wants<br />Israeli troop presence in the region. It could<br />possibly happen relatively soon, but I think 1<br />month is too short of a window.","Haley Ford (15%): Based off statement of both<br />Israel and Hamas leaders a ceasefire seems<br />unlikely, however influence from international<br />actors has been pushing for one. An official<br />ceasefire agreement and NOT a humanitarian<br />pause is even less likely, I would increase the<br />likelihood if a pause was an option.","Ryan Foley (15%): A House committee already pass a<br />bill to get weight loss drugs covered by Medicare<br />in June but it didn't make it through the Senate.<br />With Congress meeting twice a week currently, it<br />becomes less likely that we'll see such a bill<br />passed before the deadline as well. The current<br />argument against passing this bill is that it<br />would increase federal spending by $35 billion by<br />2034. With the precedent of one of these bills not<br />fully passing and with only a few sessions left<br />before our deadline, I don't see the bill passing.","Jessica Armour (20%): wrote briefing probably not<br />likely considering not much has been done to pass<br />a bill, will probably happen within the next year<br />or two though.","Brooke Mcdermott (3%): Briefing","Simon Gersten (40%): There is a bill relevant to<br />this question that has reached house committee.<br />However, the bill might not be pushed through by<br />December 1st, but instead might be included in a<br />later end of the year package. It will definitely<br />happen soon because Big Pharma loves to get<br />people hooked on drugs instead of addressing the<br />root causes of issues, it just may not happen by<br />December 1.","Gracie Culpepper (2%): Congress has bigger issues<br />to deal with right now, I really think (and hope)<br />they don't focus on this right now. There's too<br />little time I think as well","David Daniels (0%): It's highly unlikely that a<br />bill will be signed into law allowing Medicare<br />to cover GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Ozempic<br />or Wegovy by December 1. There isn't enough time<br />for such a bill to gain momentum, and it lacks<br />widespread support due to concerns about cost,<br />necessity, and prioritization of other legislative<br />matters. Congress is currently focused on more<br />pressing issues, and the financial implications of<br />covering these expensive medications would likely<br />deter significant backing at this point. These<br />reasons considered, I assign a 0% probability.","Jeffrey Markowitz (50%): The treat and reduce<br />obesity act of 2023, which would do this is<br />currently in the Finance committee in the senate.<br />After passing the senate, it would simply need to<br />be signed into law by the president. This could<br />happen before the deadline of January 3rd, after<br />which time it would need to be re-introduced. I<br />could especially see this happening following the<br />election, however the time frame is very short.","Corinne O'Dell (5%): Passing a bill to allow<br />Medicare to cover GLP-1 weight loss drugs<br />like Ozempic or Wegovy through both the House<br />and Senate, and then securing the president's<br />signature, is unlikely in the near term due<br />to several political and fiscal challenges.<br />While there is bipartisan support for expanding<br />Medicare's coverage of weight-loss treatments,<br />significant concerns over the high cost to<br />Medicare—potentially billions of dollars<br />annually—create strong opposition. Lawmakers<br />would need to balance this potential financial<br />burden against the health benefits for millions<br />of Americans with obesity-related conditions.<br />Furthermore, partisan gridlock, especially as<br />Congress debates broader health and budgetary<br />issues, could slow or block the passage of this<br />legislation. Even if the bill passes through both<br />chambers, the political climate and competing<br />priorities could make it difficult to prioritize<br />such a measure for the president’s approval before<br />the year's end.","Vikram Bharadwaj (0%): First of all, while<br />GLP-1 medication has often been thought of as<br />\"weight-loss\" medication, under the eyes of<br />the FDA, it is strictly to be prescribed for<br />Diabetes (except for wegovy). Currently, there<br />has been enormous crackdown on the prescription<br />of these medications to those who do not have<br />diabetes, specifically ozempic. On top of this,<br />weight-loss procedures and medications are and<br />have historically been categorized as superficial,<br />and while that may be a little contentious, there<br />is no chance that that will change within the next<br />few months. Birth control is already contentious<br />enough, this type of medication opens a whole<br />new can of worms. Also congress sucks at getting<br />things passed, and any such expansions to medicare<br />are just not possible under the current government<br />makeup.","Minha Ahmad (5%): Currently, Medicare does cover<br />drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, however, not for<br />weight loss purposes. In order for these drugs to<br />be covered for weight loss, the Treat and Reduce<br />Obesity Act of 2023 would need to be passed. I<br />went into further detail in my briefing, but it<br />is unlikely this act will be looked at because<br />Congress is currently looking into bills more<br />focused on improving departments of government<br />or international affairs. However, at the same<br />time, this act was one of the most viewed bills<br />in the last legislative session, so i have left a<br />small possibility it will be looked at again this<br />session.","Kira Liscombe (15%): The latest action on the<br />Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2023 that would<br />allow this was in the House on 06/27/2024. The<br />obesity act coalition reported that it has the<br />support of over 130 Members of Congress across<br />both chambers. However, i couldnt find much recent<br />news or action on the bill. It seems like a small<br />concern amongst bigger election issues. The bill<br />would still require further approval from the<br />Senate and the President to become law at this<br />point, and i dont think that will happen before<br />December.","Alexis Frazer (15%): Before december the<br />likelihood of this bill getting signed into law<br />is low. There is not enough support, time, need,<br />or demand. Currently, Ozempic is only medically<br />distributed to patients who suffer from diabetes<br />and extending the treatment to other individuals<br />could increase the price of it causing backlash<br />and limit accessibility to those who truly need<br />it.","Abby Crowe (6%): I predict an 6% chance that this<br />bill would be signed into law. There has already<br />been a bill that passed in a committee in June,<br />but the momentum simply isn’t there to get it<br />through the floors before the deadline.","Liv Payne (0%): It seems extremely unlikely that<br />a bill like this could gain enough traction to<br />get passed. Currently, these medications are not<br />even approved for weight loss, they just happen to<br />cause it.","Victor Avila (15%): On a pessimistic note, one<br />statistic states that whether a bill has great,<br />moderate, or low support from the American people,<br />it has a consistent 30% chance of being passed<br />through congress and being signed into law.<br />Although when dealing with pharmacueticals, it<br />is important to follow the money as the chance<br />of a bill being passed skyrockets once you have<br />the money for special interest and lobbying.<br />In the first six months of 2023, Novo Nordisk<br />spent $2.9 million on lobbying for weight loss<br />coverage, compared to only spending a total of<br />350,000 in 2022. This partially explains why just<br />recently a bill regarding weight loss drugs was<br />passed through comittee despite over 2 decades of<br />medicare not being allowed to provide weight loss<br />drugs. Not much data is available regarding their<br />2024 spending but with the current rate at which<br />congress works, I think the deadline takes the<br />chances of this happening down drastically, so I<br />gave it a 15% probability.","William Willis (10%): (Wrote a brief) There is a<br />10% probability that there will be a bill signed<br />into law allowing Medicare to cover GLP-1 weight<br />loss drugs by Dec 1. The reasons that I believe<br />that are because there is not much momentum on<br />the bill being signed, it seems like a logistical<br />nightmare if it were to get signed making sure the<br />people that have the drug have it, and there are<br />more pressing bills to get passed.","Erin Ho (7%): As of right now, there’s been barely<br />any conversation around the bill to allow GLP-1<br />weight loss drugs to be covered by Medicare. As<br />we’re nearing the November elections, I don’t<br />think the House, or the Senate will be considering<br />this bill since there is bigger fish to fry. The<br />House Committee merely passed it to the floor,<br />this means the House hasn’t even made a vote on<br />it, and the committee only passed it in late June<br />of this year. We could see it next year, but by<br />December it is a low probability.","Abigail Harris (0%): There’s just no momentum<br />behind this effort right now and there’s so little<br />time between now and Dec. 1st. No one is throwing<br />their weight towards this in a presidential<br />election year. The main issue will any bill<br />like this is that it would create scarcity for<br />Americans with diabetes who need the procedures<br />and that it is a form of gov assistance meaning<br />some people will always be against it.","Colin Barry (40%): I think this is slightly less<br />likely to happen than not as the bill that would<br />allow for this coverage has only passed the House<br />committee at this point. The bill still needs to<br />clear the full House and Senate, as well as get<br />presidential approval. This is unlikely to occur<br />in the time left, especially in an election year.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (0.1%): If it were to<br />happen, it definitely wouldn’t be in this time<br />frame. Second, Congress definitely has other<br />priorities (such as the election).","Haley Ford (0%): Price, timeframe, current version<br />of the bill (briefing)","Alex Vrolijk (1%): This is because allowing<br />Medicare, a government program, to expand and<br />cover GLP-1 is politically infeasible. There is<br />also not a lot of time for this to happen by the<br />deadline and it will take time for it to reach the<br />policy agenda if it ever even does.","Shayna Van Glish (5%): I think that there is a<br />5% chance that a bill is signed into law allowing<br />medicare to cover GLP-1 weight loss drugs by Dec<br />1. The process for this to happen would take more<br />time making it very unlikely the law could be<br />passed by that deadline.","Findleigh Ague (10%): Since weight loss/weight<br />gain is considered a cosmetic condition, Medicare<br />does not cover these medications unless they<br />are being used for another stated health issue<br />like diabetes or risk of stroke or high blood<br />pressure. But efforts are being made because now<br />that the American Medical Association declared<br />that obesity is a disease, many are pushing<br />for weight loss medications to be covered by<br />Medicare. The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of<br />2023 has been reintroduced to Congress several<br />times with efforts to make weight loss drugs more<br />affordable and accessible. However, as we know,<br />getting a bill passed is not a quick process,<br />and even though the Ways and Means Committee of<br />the House voted on the bill and passed it into<br />the full House, now it has to get House approval,<br />Senate approval, and endorsement from the<br />President. Getting this bill passed is probably<br />not a priority of Congress right now, so for that<br />reason, I don’t think we’re going to see Medicare<br />paying for these medications before December 1st.","John Mathis (5%): There just isn’t the support<br />required to pass this bill. Republicans want to<br />pass as little as possible before the election,<br />and Biden has bigger things to worry about than<br />Medicaid/Medicare covering ozempic. During an<br />election year it just feels like there are more<br />important things going on for everyone, so it’s<br />unlikely to pass.","Edward Tsui (6%): Given how expensive these type<br />of drugs are, yet how fat we are as an American<br />Population, I do not find this bill being passed<br />anytime soon. Most bills fail, as there is a 94%<br />failure rate with any bill in Congress. With the<br />proposed Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2023,<br />it has not even passed the sponsoring House<br />nonetheless been fully addressed in the Senate.<br />This was proposed back in June. Furthermore,<br />this would be a monumental shift in Medicaid and<br />Medicare legislation to allow for this subsidiary<br />purpose of weight loss to be covered by the<br />American taxpayer. Let's say they do want to<br />make the change, and the bill is considered, the<br />financial burden on the budget would be insane.<br />The timeline helps negate the reality of this bill<br />passing anytime soon, especially by December 1st.","Matthew Harvey (10%): I think the timeline of<br />the issue is factoring into this issue. As of<br />June this year, House Ways and Means passed some<br />legislation that would allow Medicare to cover<br />some weight loss medication with strict rules.<br />However I have not even seen this brought up to<br />a floor vote, and even if it is passed, it would<br />have to go through the senate and then sent for<br />the president's signature. It is also believed<br />that the mass majority of people have hesitation<br />with these types of medications on grounds of<br />weight loss as opposed to treating illnesses.","Carson Ankeny (2%): I just don’t think this Is<br />Congress’s top priority right now, there’s very<br />few legislating days left before the election and<br />this doesn’t seem like a bill that would be passed<br />in that lame duck garbage time.","Sara Whitmire (10%): Although a bill passed the<br />House of Reps in June of this year, I really doubt<br />that it’ll go very far or become a law. There’s<br />not a real urgent need for this to happen, and<br />Medicare spending/expansion is already a touchy<br />subject for a lot of folks in Congress. Plus,<br />expanding access to Ozempic would deplete the<br />supply for its intended users.","Reece Slater (0%): I don't think this bill has<br />enough support to be passed especially in this<br />short time frame. As I learned in another class<br />yesterday, this Congress is on track to be the<br />least productive every. Only passing a handful<br />of their thousands of proposed bills. I think<br />Congress has others things on their docket before<br />they address this.","Leo Zegarra (17%): The chances of a bill allowing<br />Medicare to cover GLP-1 weight loss drugs passing<br />by December 1 are pretty low given the time it<br />takes for things like that. Although it passed<br />a House committee, the bill could face budget<br />concerns and people opposing it.","Hayden Morehouse (5%): See briefing","Franco Bravo (30%): I believe that this wont<br />happen simply because of the time bills like this<br />take in our Gov. Various articles have mentioned<br />that we are just now in the first steps of this<br />bill being signed, but there is still significant<br />progress both in tweaks to the bill, but also to<br />the actual bill itself being passed. Therefore a<br />Dec 1 timeline seems unlikely.","Kira Liscombe (45%): Pew Research Center reported<br />that about two-thirds of the voting-eligible<br />population turned out for the 2020 presidential<br />election – the highest rate for any national<br />election since 1900. Turnout still greatly<br />differed by state. I think its important to note<br />how the pandemic and intense campaign between Joe<br />Biden and Donald Trump had a great influence on<br />those impressive 2020 turnout numbers. Most of the<br />reports I found about early voting so far mention<br />high voter turnout, including in Georgia which is<br />an important swing state. I think this election<br />has potential to beat the 2020 numbers, but is<br />more similar to the climate of Trump and Hillary<br />Clinton and will proably end up falling below<br />2020.","Jessica Armour (85%): I would say it is highly<br />likely that voter turnout will be much, much<br />higher in 2024 than it was in 2020. First off,<br />the pandemic effected voting in 2020, whereas<br />we currently do not have one. Along with that,<br />this is one of the most cut-throat elections that<br />America has seen in comparison to recent ones,<br />therefore I would say it comes to no surprise that<br />voter turnout will be higher.","Hayden Morehouse (35%): I think voter turnout will<br />be ok but last election we saw one of the highest<br />voter turnouts of all time. While it is possible I<br />do not see this number being surpassed this year","Abby Crowe (18%): I predict a 18% chance that<br />voter turnout will be higher in the 2024 US<br />presidential election than 2020. This is based<br />on a number of factors, including unprecedented<br />turnout in 2020, covid circumstances, youth<br />registration rates, and voter fatigue.","Simon Gersten (18%): Voter turnout in 2020 was<br />at historic levels, in part due to the COVID<br />pandemic and extraordinarily high enthusiasm.<br />In this election, neither candidate has as much<br />enthusiasm, and I also believe Kamala will lose,<br />which means that voter turnout in big cities will<br />likely be lower. I think voter turnout will be<br />high, but not as high as the historic levels of<br />2020.","Ladi Fashogbon (71%): All signs, in my opinion,<br />point to a high turnout in 2024 which I think<br />could surpass 2020. Voter interest is higher,<br />and the surge in early voting supports the idea<br />that more Americans are engaged in this election<br />or more people are being campaigned towards. I<br />set a 71 percent prediction due to this, (with<br />likely a margin of error of 10 percent). While<br />some uncertainties remain, the likelihood of<br />increased participation appears strong based on<br />the available data.","David Daniels (0%): Mail-in ballots are no<br />longer available to every citizen automatically,<br />which typically helps increase voter turnout.<br />Additionally, voter registration has declined.<br />There has also been an unusual decrease in voter<br />turnout from 2018 to 2022. I believe this will<br />reflect on the general election as well. Given<br />these reasons, I believe there is only a 0-5%<br />chance that voter turnout will exceed that of<br />2020.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (43.5%): This was a<br />difficult question. I looked at the 2020 voter<br />turnout timeline. My main goal here was to compare<br />where we are at in terms of voter turnout with<br />2020. I found that by this time voter turnout<br />was a overwhelmingly higher in some states and<br />higher by a few percentage points in some other<br />states. I attribute this to the pandemic and<br />mailed-in votes. Since now there is no threat of<br />voting in-person early, or during election day,<br />I believe turnout will be large, but it will be<br />less than 2020. I believe that the pandemic could<br />have created more of a sense of urgency for people<br />because everyone was directly affected by it.","Erin Ho (27%): In 2020, there was dissent towards<br />Trump and his presidency which caused a surgency<br />of young voters to choose Biden at the time.<br />A phrase I remember was “Settle for Biden” and<br />Democrats were advocating amongst the youth and<br />new voters to use their vote. This time around,<br />there’s dissent towards both the Democrats and<br />the Republicans, which can affect overall turnout<br />since people may not feel inclined to vote at all.<br />In 2020, it was a record high number of people<br />that came out to vote and I just don’t see it<br />happening again this year.","Victor Avila (80%): Just over two-thirds of<br />adults in the U.S. voted in 2020. But from state<br />to state, the turnout ranged from 54% to 80%,<br />leaving a lot of difference in voting culture.Two<br />key swing states—Georgia and North Carolina—saw a<br />record turnout on their first day of early voting<br />this election cycle. By Friday, over 1 million<br />voters had sent in their decision either in person<br />or by mail in Georgia. In North Carolina, election<br />officials said more than 353,000 ballots were<br />cast on the first day of early voting this past<br />Thursday. In the US as a whole nearly 28 million<br />people have cast a mail-in or in-person ballot<br />in the 2024 election as of today. At Sunday,<br />October 25, 2020 almost 60 million people had<br />already voted, but the current rate is growing<br />exponentially, only being 14 million a week prior.<br />These record breaking surges in with early voting<br />plus the addition of states like California still<br />offering mail in voting, I think there is a 80<br />percent probability that voter turn out will be<br />higher this year.","Colin Barry (35%): I do not expect the turnout<br />rate in 2024 to surpass the near record highs of<br />2020 as there are significantly less major events<br />that each party is trying to mobilize their voter<br />bases on than there were in 2020. Dissatisfaction<br />with candidates by some voters also may contribute<br />to less voters participating in the election.","Vikram Bharadwaj (15%): Generally, it seems that<br />this election does not seem to have the same<br />amount of drive behind it as the previous one in<br />2020. Voter turnout, while record high for early<br />voting, does not seem to be nearly the same as it<br />was in 2020.","Liv Payne (20%): During the 2020 election,<br />COVID was rampant, meaning that many people<br />had to stay home. Mail in ballots were pushed<br />by the government as a way to make sure people<br />could still participate, and we saw spikes in<br />participation. Instead of being forced to take<br />the time to seek out a specific location on a<br />specific date, people could vote from the comfort<br />of their own homes, and as we know from Social<br />Choices, when things are made easier, more people<br />are likely to do it. Now that we do not have the<br />government endorsing mail in ballots, I believe<br />that voter participation will drop compared to the<br />last election.","Shayna Van Glish (55%): I think that this is a<br />really important election and people know that<br />making them more likely to vote. This is why I'm<br />giving it a 55% chance that it is higher than it<br />was in 2020.","Minha Ahmad (30%): The voter turnout for the 2020<br />election was extremely high, being the highest<br />election turnout since 1972. This was mainly<br />because of the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase<br />in absentee ballots. I think that for 2024, the<br />voter interest isn’t as high as it was because of<br />the state of affairs in 2020, so there will not be<br />as much turnout.","Carson Ankeny (25%): Absentee ballots and the<br />nature of the 2020 race definitely increased<br />turnout. In 2024 I don’t see the same energy that<br />I saw in the 2020 race about the urgency of it,<br />especially voting for Biden vs. Harris, and Trump<br />running for a third time.","William Willis (62%): I feel like there will be<br />a 62% probability of an increased voter turnout<br />for this years election. There has been a lot<br />more media presence urging people to vote for this<br />years election. After this past election people<br />feel that it is important to get their votes in.<br />With the amount of media focusing on voting this<br />year, there will definitely be an increase.","Corinne O'Dell (37%): I think turnout will be<br />high due to the nature of the candidates, but<br />2020 had so many unprecedented initiatives due to<br />covid to get people to vote. There were many ways<br />to vote absentee that some states got rid of for<br />the election this year. Additionally, some voters<br />may feel less urgency or satisfaction with the<br />candidates compared to 2020, when the pandemic,<br />mail-in ballot expansions, and a polarized<br />political climate drove more voters to the polls.","Reece Slater (26%): My gut says it is not<br />very likely , but I also don't want to rule it<br />completely out, as truly anything could happen.<br />I feel like in 2020 people felt like it was<br />a much higher stakes election. Also, due to<br />COVID, ballots were shipped to houses all over<br />the country, increasing turnout even slightly.<br />Although people recognize the importance of this<br />2024 election, I think it will fall slightly short<br />to 2020.","Matthew Harvey (30%): I believe that this election<br />has higher stakes than that of the previous<br />election. However I unfortunately believe that<br />many have been dissuaded by both candidates<br />and feel that they don’t trust either one. This<br />involves less turnout. Also with the threats made<br />to the voter integrity by some sides, it has also<br />led to dissuading minorities.","Sara Whitmire (40%): briefing!","Findleigh Ague (54%): I think that the numbers<br />are going to be really close, so it is hard to<br />say. But alternative voting measures have become<br />much more popular since 2020, so even though they<br />won't be necessary for many people anymore because<br />we're not currently in a pandemic, people are<br />still going to and are using them now. Also, Trump<br />recently went back on what he previously said<br />about mail-in voting, and he is now encouraging<br />it. There will likely be an increase in Republican<br />voters at the very least.","John Mathis (35%): The prevalence and push oof<br />mail in ballots in 2020 caused insane voter<br />turnout, with voter shares we haven’t seen since<br />the 60s. I think that while the early vote numbers<br />are big nationwide, this is mostly due to both<br />sides pushing for more early voting and less of a<br />share of the electorate will show up on November<br />5th.","Haley Ford (54%): 2020 was a record high--> 1 of<br />the candidates is the same, increased polarity,<br />more early voting already, hard to know for sure,<br />early voting #'s doesn't tell whole story","Edward Tsui (60%): I think 2020 was a unique<br />election because of Covid and Absentee ballots.<br />While early voting is smashing records in Georgia<br />and North Carolina before Election Day, I am<br />unclear how this would affect the overall trends<br />in voting for this election. Polymarket reports<br />around 58-60, but I have a hard time verifying<br />its reliability. However, statista has shown a<br />general increase in every election, especially<br />since 2000. This election has been so expensive in<br />terms of fundraising, and younger voters are more<br />encouraged to vote than ever before. I say slight<br />lean from 50-50.","Franco Bravo (90%): Simply put due to the fear<br />of covid being gone, the polarizing nature of<br />this election, and also the fact there is already<br />a record number of early voting, I am very sure<br />that this election will have more voters than the<br />previous one"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":145.38812785388131},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will a bill be signed<br />into law allowing<br />Medicare to cover GLP-1<br />weight loss drugs (e.g.<br />Ozempic, Wegovy) by Dec<br />1?","Will Israel and Hamas<br />agree to a ceasefire<br />before December 1?","Will voter turnout be<br />higher in the 2024 US<br />presidential election<br />than in 2020?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will a bill be signed<br />into law allowing<br />Medicare to cover GLP-1<br />weight loss drugs (e.g.<br />Ozempic, Wegovy) by Dec<br />1?","Will Israel and Hamas<br />agree to a ceasefire<br />before December 1?","Will voter turnout be<br />higher in the 2024 US<br />presidential election<br />than in 2020?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"127076a2342f":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"127072511d7e":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"127076a2342f","visdat":{"127076a2342f":["function (y) ","x"],"127072511d7e":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

There has been so<br />many stories circulating about not only Gonzalez's<br />mishandling of her staff, but more importantly her<br />lack of staff preparation and cohesiveness with<br />the court. Additionally, there have been at least<br />three cases of victims coming forward about their<br />victims rights being violated. She won by a small<br />margin during 2020, so I don't see it being very<br />likely that she has some massive wave of support<br />from the Athens community after her chaotic term.<br />I think one of the only ways she could win is<br />with her party affiliation and very often voters<br />rely on the affiliation rather than taking time to<br />research candidates.","Erin Ho (56%): I couldn’t find a lot of sources<br />talking about how the public felt on her opponent,<br />and I haven’t seen a lot of articles specifically<br />talking about her or her controversies. I feel<br />like unless there is a major scandal that comes<br />out, aside from her lawsuit or not handling her<br />cases carefully, she will be reelected because<br />most of the time people don’t research about<br />local candidates. That said, her opponent is<br />independent, and I don’t see a lot of policies<br />aside from his critiques of hers.","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): Gonzalez's opponent<br />tripled the amount of signatures required to<br />run and seems extremely qualified. Additionally,<br />Gonzalez's term was lowlighted by Laken Riley,<br />which I think many see as a massive failure.","Haley Ford (13%): Deborah's term has been marked<br />by staffing problems and criminal justice issues<br />causing unhappiness in the community. I asked a<br />friend who has lived in Athens/Oconee her whole<br />life her point of view, and she said Democrats<br />and Republicans alike dislike Gonzalez. (meaning<br />she will not get Dem vote just for her party).<br />Her opponent, Kalki, is running as independent,<br />which make sense given it is local level and<br />additionally his platform is to improve and serve<br />his community effectively, not push a party agenda<br />on a local venue.","Simon Gersten (37%): Deborah Gonzalez is facing<br />some scandals ahead of the election, including<br />skepticism concerning her high staff turnover and<br />difficulty managing cases. She is also currently<br />being sued for not properly doing her job.<br />Her opponent is gaining traction among voters<br />concerned about public safety and prosecutorial<br />competency. None of this may matter, however, as<br />many people likely do not care about this election<br />and will vote randomly.","Abby Crowe (80%): I predict an 80% chance that<br />Deborah Gonzalez will be re-elected as District<br />Attorney. I think that because most people<br />are going to vote simply for the presidential<br />election, her incumbency advantage will help her<br />gain votes from those who have no idea who she is.<br />Also, the other guy is running as an independent<br />not a republican or I would lean on less sure.","Corinne O'Dell (5%): With the lawsuit out<br />against her, and local Democrats like Mayor Kelly<br />Girtz endorsing her opponent, it is unlikely<br />that Gonzalez will be reelected. Judges have<br />reprimanded her office for lapses in preparedness<br />and, most notably, violations of victim rights<br />under Marcy’s Law, requiring that victims be<br />contacted prior to plea deals. Kalki has also<br />raised close to $500,000 for his campaign where<br />Gonazalez has only raised $100,000. Kalki is also<br />supported by both Democrats and Republicans.","Gracie Culpepper (27%): I'm using wisdom of the<br />crowd here, but she also has a bunch of lawsuits<br />against her right now, so I'm putting it pretty<br />low.","Kira Liscombe (35%): It seems to me that with<br />her public disapproval by many political figures–<br />including the mayor and governor, her seemingly<br />strong opponent, and the narrow 2020 election<br />outcome, Gonzalez does not have a strong chance<br />for re-election. I elaborated on this in my brief.","Liv Payne (55%): It was quite difficult to find<br />information about this election. Most of my<br />research yielded pages in favor or against her,<br />but little data regarding how people are leaning.<br />There is the \"incumbent advantage\" to consider,<br />wherein those who already hold office tend to<br />remain in office, but Gonzalez also has a number<br />of active lawsuits against her, which may hurt her<br />chances. However, Athens is a democratic-leaning<br />county, so she has the potential to win based<br />on political affiliation alone. Because of this,<br />I have put my prediction at a little over 50%,<br />simply because there is not enough information for<br />me to feel more confident one way or the other.","David Daniels (93%): I believe Deborah<br />Gonzalez is almost certain to be re-elected as<br />District Attorney of Georgia’s Western Circuit.<br />As the incumbent in a heavily Democratic<br />area—Athens-Clarke County, which leans about<br />70-80% Democratic—she has a strong advantage.<br />Most voters tend to support candidates along party<br />lines rather than focusing on the DA's specific<br />job performance, meaning her party affiliation<br />will likely outweigh concerns about her potential<br />effectiveness in the role. Running as a Democrat<br />in this predominantly blue county provides her<br />an edge over her opponent, Kalki Yalamanchili,<br />despite any questions about her capabilities.<br />These reasons considered, I assign a 93%<br />probability of her re-election.","Minha Ahmad (39%): I think that Athens is majority<br />Democratic, and there are some who, without prior<br />knowledge, see Gonzalez on the ballot and simply<br />vote for her because she is Democrat. However,<br />there is also a great majority of Athens residents<br />who have strong opinions about Gonzalez and she<br />has faced much controversy in the public eye as of<br />late due to the fact that she is facing lawsuits<br />and victims' rights violations.","Victor Avila (15%): I do not believe it is very<br />likely that Deborah Gonzalez is reelected as DA.<br />Gonzalez's record is not the best considering<br />she has lawsuits against her as well as charges<br />dropped for heinous crime simply due to lack of<br />effort by her office. She won by a slim 3 point<br />margin in her 2020 runoff election and I believe<br />personal vote against her due to her record will<br />be enough to bring the independent candidate to a<br />victory.","Alexis Frazer (35%): The public perception of<br />her is not great right now. It could be a toss<br />up considering a large proportion of voters may<br />be uninformed about her political views. Her<br />opposition is an independent which could gather<br />support from both sides as a more moderate<br />position.","Rommy Etzion (35%): View Briefing","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (38.5%): For obvious<br />reasons, this is a question we can't rely on<br />polls for. I talked to some of my friends and<br />the general consensus is that Gonzalez is not a<br />good DA. The question is: Does the general larger<br />Athens population know that? I'm hoping people<br />are being active in Athens Facebook groups and<br />social media apps such as Nextdoor. I believe this<br />is where most of the \"successful\" campaigning can<br />happen for the opponent Yamalanchili. However,<br />some voters might vote for Gonzalez simply because<br />of her party affiliation. Yamalanchili has raised<br />more in his campaign than Gonzalez, so there's<br />that.","Colin Barry (41%): Gonzalez has not been the most<br />popular DA in her time in Clarke, having multiple<br />lawsuits currently filed against her. This has<br />resulted in her opponent being endorsed by those<br />typically on her party’s side so I believe it’s<br />less likely she wins.","William Willis (30%): I don't think that Deborah<br />Gonzales will be re-elected as district attorney<br />of Athens. She currently has a three active<br />lawsuits against her. She has had many associates<br />leave while she has been in office. When looking<br />up the election on google I can only find new and<br />relevant infromation on Kalki Yalamanxhili for<br />this year. This makes me beleive that he has a lot<br />more momentum than her.","Abigail Harris (40%): There are an overwhelming<br />amount of Democrats in Clarke County. There are<br />also a lot of Harris signs with a Kalki sign right<br />beside them. There’s little polling available<br />in the district on this issue, but it’s a<br />Presidential Election year, and we know Democrats<br />in Clarke are going to turn out for Harris. I’m<br />ultimately going to put Gonzalez winning at 40%.<br />Kalki has run an aggressive ground campaign, and I<br />know my bias is strong but I am leaning on so many<br />Democrats endorsing an Independent over her that<br />she is voted out and becomes known as a one-term<br />everything.","Jessica Armour (35%): People are very angry with<br />her due to the fact that she did not do everything<br />she originally promised while in office. I think<br />it's pretty unlikely that she will be selected for<br />another term considering her lack of support.","John Mathis (32%): Overall, I think that Gonzalez<br />has about a 32% chance of winning re-election.<br />Republicans will almost certainly just vote<br />for the Independent on the ballot, and I think<br />Yalamanchili has received enough financial<br />support and bipartisan endorsement to overcome<br />the incumbency advantage as well as the party<br />advantage. The amount of time Gonzalez has spent<br />in the local news has been detrimental to her<br />career, and considering she just barely won her<br />last race, I think it's unlikely she pulls it off<br />again.","Vikram Bharadwaj (65%): Currently Gonzalez has<br />received a lot of public backlash regarding<br />her term within the DA's office, however the<br />fact of the matter is she is running against an<br />independent with no other progressive candidate.<br />To me, this seems clear that the election will<br />be decided on party lines, as more people will be<br />willing to vote for her than some unknown third<br />party candidate. Incumbency advantage is real,<br />especially in this case.","Shayna Van Glish (7%): Deborah Gonzalez is a very<br />not liked representative making it not likely that<br />she will win the re-election. Her opponent has<br />done a great job putting his name out there and<br />I feel like due to name recognition people will<br />know to vote against her rather than just voting<br />party line. I am giving her a 7% chance of being<br />reelected.","Findleigh Ague (55%): It seems like a lot of<br />people are unhappy with Deborah Gonzalez. She<br />claims she needs four more years to be able to<br />implement the changes they have been working on<br />that may have caused the disorganization that<br />many have complained about, but I'm not sure if<br />Athens citizens will be willing to give her that<br />second chance. There have been a lot of legal<br />issues because of \"indifference\" towards cases,<br />lack of preparation from the DA's office, lack of<br />training of prosecutors, and much more. It seems<br />like her opponent, Kalki Yamanchili, has more<br />CJ experience, as he served as an ADA for over<br />five years, whereas Gonzalez did not have that<br />same experience before stepping into office and<br />has also faced criticisms for hiring prosecutors<br />with little CJ experience as well. Despite all<br />this, Clarke County typically votes very blue, so<br />maybe they would opt to vote for Gonzalez instead<br />of Yamanchili since she is a Democrat and he is<br />Republican.","Reece Slater (60%): From a simple Google search,<br />she seems to be doing a terrible job. Many<br />lawsuits, quick attorney turnover, mishandling<br />evidence, etc, etc. Kalki also seems to have more<br />funding and more outspoken support. Although this<br />may be true, I think she will be most likely be<br />re-elected. I don't think most people are paying<br />close attention to a DA election, and will simply<br />vote for the Democrat or Incumbent. If people<br />did some research, Kalki would win. I think most<br />people just care about the presidential vote<br />and won't put much effort into the DA election,<br />leading to the incumbent winning.","Ladi Fashogbon (50%): Not many people believe or<br />trust her. \"Gonzalez has some very loud critics<br />who have a very different definition of smooth.<br />They point to cases like child molestation charges<br />dismissed by a judge in October 2024 because the<br />DA’s office showed ‘indifference’ and lack of<br />preparation.There was a mistrial in June 2024<br />because a judge ruled the prosecutor mishandled<br />evidence in an ‘incompetent moment.’\" but this was<br />not proven wrong.","Sara Whitmire (44%): Gonzalez’s time as a DA has<br />been kind of a failure :/ she has a lawsuit filed<br />against her, and a portion of her staff has left.<br />Kalki’s campaign is much more organized and, from<br />what I can tell, has more support financially.<br />With that being said, a strategy for many voters<br />is to vote Democratic down the ballot, so an<br />unprepared voter in blue-leaning Athens might vote<br />for her due to her political affiliation.","Matthew Harvey (40%): I believe that this is<br />definitely a hard and difficult question to<br />predict. this is due to the little information<br />we have on the candidates (both Gonzalez and<br />her challenger). There also does not exist any<br />accessible public polling in order to get a<br />sense of what Athens is feeling. However, I do<br />believe the current DA is under strict scrutiny<br />at the moment in accordance with how her office<br />is being run. Therefore I believe that she has a<br />less likelihood of winning even though she is the<br />incumbent","Alex Vrolijk (40%): Since this is a local race<br />there is not much data about it but I’ve heard<br />numerous Athens residents talk about how them and<br />lots of others think Gonzalez has done a horrible<br />job. However, she is still running under democrat<br />so she could collect votes from uninformed voters<br />who vote party line.","Carson Ankeny (35%): In spite of her partisan<br />affiliation, based on my research it seems that<br />Gonzalez is highly unpopular. I think that there<br />is a decent chance that this overall unpopularity<br />outweighs the partisan affiliation of the<br />district.","Edward Tsui (30%): Her track record sucks. 4<br />accounts of cases violating Marsy's law, and cases<br />regarding child moelstions, DUI's, and Rape all<br />being neglected in some aspect make me believe<br />that Kalki will win. He has her previous campaign<br />manager and the Athens mayor's endorsement. If she<br />wins reelection, it will be based on party lines<br />and voters not checking her background. I think<br />enough people are frustrated to signify change. At<br />least one of her active lawsuits against her are<br />valid.","Leo Zegarra (39%): While Deborah Gonzalez has<br />supporters who value her progressive approach,<br />there is strong local opposition and criticism<br />of her handling of cases and office management.<br />Gonzalez faces a tough re-election after<br />realistically only winning 51.9% of the vote<br />in the runoff she had in 2020. Her incumbency<br />provides a small advantage, keeping her chances<br />alive despite challenges.","Franco Bravo (30%): From the information I have<br />collected, and the few articles that I have<br />read I believe that Deborah Gonzales will not<br />be reelected as DA, due to several lawsuits and<br />negative public press."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.34999999999999998,0.41999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,0.25,0.29999999999999999,0.75,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.75,0.94999999999999996,0.29999999999999999,0.68000000000000005,0.39000000000000001,0.57999999999999996,0.88,0.68000000000000005,0.34999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.55000000000000004,0.45000000000000001,0.45000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.75,0.28000000000000003,0.29999999999999999,0.55000000000000004,0.75,0.45000000000000001,0.42999999999999999],"y":[1.9730196075281128,1.9544615025864913,2.0072742192074657,1.9715930980164558,2.0048470757203178,2.0132605234626682,2.0429379344685001,1.970613667764701,1.9928378402721136,2.027507050638087,2.0199081196216868,2.0282984030665832,2.0380503255873919,2.0426438176073134,1.9967294888803735,2.0336604661308231,2.0368514843983574,1.9611447426024824,2.0099489002954214,1.972593768662773,1.9552259262884035,2.0118185122264549,2.0234343146672473,1.9661173950415105,2.0188413022318854,1.9808511776151136,1.9607607464538888,2.0214083194732666,1.9726860247552396,2.0026032501365991],"text":["Brooke Mcdermott (35%): Harris has an even higher<br />approval rating from 18-29 than Biden. However,<br />most polls show that Trump is still getting<br />roughly 30-34% of the 18-29 range approval. I'm<br />unsure how varied this election will be compared<br />to 2020, but I do however think he will still be<br />lower or the same than 2020.","Erin Ho (42%): In 2020, Biden took home 60% of the<br />18–29-year-old voters and Trump took 36% according<br />to CBS News and some other polls. Currently, there<br />is more appeal of young voters towards Harris than<br />Trump which could sway things towards her end. I’m<br />not sure if this question is asking if Trump WILL<br />get the larger share of the total vote or WILL he<br />get a larger share than in 2020. For this, I say<br />it is unlikely at either end.","Jeffrey Markowitz (35%): It seems like the Harris<br />campaign is mobilizing more voters, and most of<br />the young voters are democrats.","Ryan Foley (25%): 66% of young voter align with<br />the democratic party meaning that Trump already<br />has a disadvantage. There are also 8 million newly<br />eligible voters in this election, meaning that<br />there could be a big increase in turnout as well.<br />This will likely help the democratic party as many<br />of the new voters are likely democratic. The only<br />base that Trump has growing popularity with is<br />young men, however, there are differing reports on<br />the proportion of young men that actually support<br />him. These factors make it clear that Trump<br />doesn't have much young support at all.","Jessica Armour (30%): Harvard Institute of<br />Politics currently has young voter at 60/32 with<br />Trump having less younger voters. According to<br />other resources Trump won the 2020 election with<br />39% of young voters. I think it’s very unlikely he<br />will over do that for this election.","Simon Gersten (75%): I wrote a brief about this","Abby Crowe (15%): I predict a 15% chance that<br />Trump receives a larger share of the young people<br />vote. Kamala is miles ahead of him at the time,<br />but it is possible that he could receive more than<br />the 40% he received in 2020","Liv Payne (15%): Young voters have historically<br />skewed Democratic. In 2020, Trump received only<br />35% from this group, and many have accreddited<br />Biden's win to young voters. Now, people seem to<br />be leaning even more Democratic, especially among<br />young women voters, who are increasing turnout<br />this election season. Therefore, I do not think<br />that Trump will get more young voters, and will<br />most likely lose support in this age range.","Gracie Culpepper (75%): I reread the question<br />and realized I had misunderstood, I do think that<br />Trump will receive more votes from younger people<br />in this election than in the last election","David Daniels (95%): I believe Donald Trump will<br />gain more support from 18-29-year-old voters in<br />the 2024 election than he did in 2020, with a<br />95% probability of outperforming his previous<br />numbers. Current forecasts by Decision Desk HQ<br />and FiveThirtyEight show Trump with over a 50%<br />chance of winning, a notable increase from his<br />low 2020 odds. This heightened electability<br />reflects shifting attitudes across demographics,<br />including younger voters. Additionally, increased<br />dissatisfaction with the Biden administration,<br />especially around economic and social issues,<br />suggests that younger voters may view Trump as a<br />viable alternative. This trend signals stronger<br />support from this age group in 2024. For these<br />reasons provided, I assign a 95% probability that<br />Trump will out preform his 2020 self with respect<br />to voters aged 18-19.","Kira Liscombe (30%): I found that according to<br />a Harvard Youth Poll, Harris leads Trump by 20<br />points among registered voters under 30 (53%-33%)<br />and by 28 points among likely voters (60%-32%). In<br />2020, there was a staggering difference in young<br />voters for Biden versus Trump, with an estimated<br />60% voting Biden and only 36% for Trump. NBC News<br />reported that Harris is backed by 60% of young<br />voters who say they’re almost certain that they<br />will cast a ballot in the presidential election,<br />which pulls in line with the 2020 election.<br />The latest CNN poll surveyed a larger sample of<br />younger voters and suggested 55% Harris to 38%<br />Trump. It doesnt really seem like younger support<br />for Trump is increasing, so i think its unlikely<br />he'll recieve a larger share.","Alexis Frazer (68%): Trump received a<br />significantly lower proportion than Biden in the<br />2020 election for 18-29 year old voters. I think<br />it was significant enough to be reversed with<br />the upcoming election. While I do not think Trump<br />would win the overall vote from this age group,<br />his number of supporters may rise.","Rommy Etzion (39%): Young voters tend to vote<br />more blue, and there can be a projected higher<br />voter turnout among young adults due to Roe v<br />Wade's prevalence in the coming election. There<br />is a large gender gap among young voters, with<br />young women strongly favoring Harris (with young<br />men more or less evenly split). This would lead<br />me to believe that the Democratic candidate will<br />receive more votes among young voters than the<br />Republican party. Additionally, young voters are<br />more susceptible to peer pressure, and if their<br />peers are voting for Harris, that can also raise<br />the percentage.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (58%): First, I looked<br />at the 18-29 votes in 2020. Trump had 35% of<br />the vote. From other articles I looked over, it<br />seems Harris is getting the majority of the 18-29<br />year old voters in 2024, but I could not get any<br />estimates of whether Trump will perform better<br />this year than in 2020. I read a Harvard Youth<br />poll which stated that the majority of young<br />voters are excited to vote, so I believe there is<br />a chance.","William Willis (88%): I believe that Donald Trump<br />will get more votes in this election than 2020.<br />He has appeared on Joe Rogan which has boosted<br />his popularity among lots of voters. It seems like<br />he is a lot more popular this election and has<br />had a lot of big name democrats come over to the<br />republican side and vote for him. He has a lot of<br />momentum and a lot of people want a shake up in<br />Washington.","Colin Barry (68%): Trump has been much more<br />popular among younger voters this election cycle<br />than the last one. This surge began when Biden was<br />still the other candidate but even with Kamala now<br />being the nomination I see it is likely that Trump<br />will secure more young voters this time around.","Abigail Harris (35%): Trump is severely<br />underperforming in relatability for young voters<br />too. Harvard clocked him 24 percentage points<br />down on relatability with the youth vote. Memes<br />have been a key part of the Harris campaign for<br />youth turnout as well. 34% of young adults say<br />they’ve been positively impacted by those memes.<br />Only 13% of young Trump supporters have said the<br />same. For a demographic that already tends to<br />be blue, Harris has targeted young voters online<br />relentlessly to press the silliness and weirdness<br />of the Republican party today with relatable memes<br />and messaging. She’s targeted abortion and climate<br />change and she’s not fear-mongering young people<br />about how terrible their lives will be but instead<br />offering them solutions to issues they care about,<br />like cost of living and the housing crisis making<br />her a popular candidate for young voters.","Minha Ahmad (65%): In this election, there are<br />a great amount of younger voters. Although young<br />people tend to vote Democrat, younger men tend to<br />vote Republican. I think this will be the major<br />factor at play if Trump were to win more of the<br />younger vote than he did in 2020. I found that<br />young men who identify as Democrat has dropped by<br />seven points in the past two years. This is not<br />only seen with the young white male population. In<br />a poll by UChicago it was found that one quarter<br />of young African American men now support Trump,<br />and the amount of Latino men supporting Trump went<br />up by six percent since the last election. I think<br />it is highly likely that Trump may win more of the<br />younger vote than he did in 2020.","Vikram Bharadwaj (60%): This question is<br />considerably close as it comes to a coinflip. In<br />2016, trump won roughly 37%,36% in 2020. Seeing<br />him win more that 2020 seems to be more likely<br />as voter turnout, especially amongst younger<br />voters was just much higher, therefore when people<br />vote today, it is likely to be a much smaller<br />population in comparison to 2020, making it<br />more likely he will have a higher younger voter<br />population.","Shayna Van Glish (55%): I think that this is going<br />to be a close one. It is hard to say as Trump will<br />definitely get around 40% of this demographic. In<br />2020, he got 36% so I am giving him a 55% chance<br />of improving this number a little.","John Mathis (45%): youth registration surged<br />after Roe was repealed, with women in particular<br />registering in droves This led to democrats<br />receiving a higher share of youth votes in<br />2022 than in 2024. I think if this holds up in<br />the slightest, Trump will not receive a higher<br />percentage of the share than in 2020. Young men,<br />however, are becoming more right wing, so this<br />is the reason I am so uncertain. Trump also did<br />relatively well in 2016 with the youth vote so<br />it is entirely possible that he appeals to young<br />voters again.","Corinne O'Dell (45%): I think it is likely that<br />Harris keeps the young vote as the issues that she<br />is campaigning heavily with are ones that young<br />people prioritize. Her campaign has also been<br />heavily targeted towards a younger audience.","Reece Slater (60%): I'm pretty much just<br />guessing. I've seen polls and studies that vary<br />substantially when it comes to the 18-29 vote.<br />Trump got 36% of the vote from 18-29 in 2020.<br />It seems logical that more young voters would be<br />likely to vote for Harris as opposed to Biden,<br />but I think Trump is set to improve in his numbers<br />compared to 2020. I think he is more favored this<br />year, but who knows.","Matthew Harvey (75%): This election is quite<br />different than the previous election in that both<br />candidates have done a good job at getting more<br />involved in the electoral process. Meaning that<br />they've done a good job to appease a wide variety<br />of constituents of all sorts. I believe that while<br />Trump alienated a lot of younger voters (there<br />wasn't an easy way to relate), I believe this<br />time around he has done a greater job at getting<br />to them and trying to get on their good side.<br />He is now perceived as a jerk, but no longer an<br />un-relatable jerk.","Sara Whitmire (28%): I doubt it. Polls say that<br />younger voters favor Harris, and the prevalence<br />of political messaging on social media provides<br />more favorable coverage for the Harris campaign.<br />The campaign has made an effort to reach younger<br />voters through celebrity endorsements, TikTok ads,<br />and podcasts with an audience of this exact age<br />range.","Findleigh Ague (30%): According to the Harvard<br />Youth Poll, Harris leads nationally among voters<br />aged 18-29, but in battleground states the<br />competition is much tighter. Additionally, Tufts's<br />Youth Poll shows that 51% of young voters that<br />are extremely likely to vote support Harris as<br />well. Both candidates have been trying to appeal<br />to younger audiences by going on podcasts and<br />participating in popular trends, which definitely<br />has helped both of them gain the attention of<br />younger voters. I think that Harris is going to<br />get more youth votes in general, so I don't think<br />that Trump will get a larger share than he did in<br />2020.","Carson Ankeny (55%): While there is a big push<br />among young men to vote for Trump, and this group<br />is actually being catered to by the Trump campaign<br />in this election, I think it’s an uphill battle<br />for his campaign to really make a dent in Harris’s<br />vote share among young people, especially young<br />women. She’s a much more inspiring candidate<br />for this group than Biden was. But overall, I<br />basically view this as a tossup and could see it<br />go either way, giving Trump a slight edge.","Alex Vrolijk (75%): While more women 18-29 have<br />shifted democrat this election, even more men<br />18-29 have shifted Republican. Women vote at<br />higher rates than men but I don’t think that will<br />offset the young men rightward shift.","Edward Tsui (45%): I think Trump is more popular<br />with our demographic than he was in 2020. While he<br />won't win the demographic, I think he will better<br />perform than his turnout in 2020 in terms of<br />percentage.

We've also seen through<br />Musk's tweets that he is open to the possibility<br />of a position under Trump. Trump has outlined his<br />plans to cut government costs and and plans to<br />put Musk in a new cabinet positioned specifically<br />for that task. He sees Musk as a great businessman<br />and thinks that qualifies him for the position.<br />However, Trump has noted that Musk does not want<br />to be in the cabinet and Trump instead plans to<br />create a completely new role for him. This lowers<br />the chances, but I want to keep it near 50 as both<br />of these men are known to not be completely true<br />to their word.","Brooke Mcdermott (5%): Trump has stated that Musk<br />doesn't want to be a part of the Cabinet, but<br />he wants some type of role at \"cost cutting.\" So<br />assumably no part in Cabinet, but hypothetically<br />there is another role available for him.","Findleigh Ague (5%): Both Trump and Elon Musk<br />have said that they don't think Musk will have an<br />official position in Trump's cabinet, but he may<br />consult in some ways. Trump wants him to be in<br />charge of cutting government spending, but he says<br />that Musk would probably be too busy to serve as<br />an official member of the Cabinet, and Musk says<br />that he doesn't need any title or position and is<br />willing to help and consult regardless.","Kira Liscombe (45%): Multiple websites are<br />reporting Elon Musk as a potential member for the<br />cabinet, though its unclear what role he would<br />serve. Some sources say that while he could play<br />a role in Trump’s administration, the former<br />president said it would not be a Cabinet position<br />because Musk himself does not want that. In Oct<br />Trump mentioned plans to appoint a “secretary<br />of cost-cutting” and claimed he would defer to<br />Musk when it came to shutting down various govt.<br />agencies. Republican control of Senate also means<br />he has more leeway in his picks. I cant find<br />anything about Musk expressing a desire to serve<br />in the cabinet, so im predicting a less than<br />likely chance, but still anticipating that it<br />could happen.","Corinne O'Dell (30%): It is unlikely that Elon<br />Musk will formally join a Trump administration.<br />While Trump has expressed interest in appointing<br />Musk as a \"Secretary of Cost Cutting\" or a<br />consultant, Musk’s existing commitments to Tesla,<br />SpaceX, and other ventures make it difficult for<br />him to dedicate significant time to government<br />work. Therefore, while Trump may welcome Musk's<br />ideas and consultations, a Cabinet position<br />or official role seems improbable given Musk's<br />extensive professional obligations and the<br />potential limitations that federal service might<br />impose on his business operations.","Simon Gersten (1%): Elon will likely be an adviser<br />to a cabinet position. He would have to sell his<br />companies to hold a cabinet position as there<br />would obviously be a conflict of interest and<br />he is definitely far more interested in going to<br />mars than he is in working for the government. He<br />will play a role in this administration, just more<br />likely to be an adviser, contractor, etc.","Abby Crowe (20%): I predict a 20% chance the Trump<br />appoints Musk to his cabinet. I do not think it<br />is impossible, but unlikely given the rhetoric<br />surrounding his cabinet so far. Trump has said<br />that he would like to keep Musk close for economic<br />advisement and Musk has suggested commissioning a<br />department of government efficiency, but it seems<br />like neither of these would qualify as a cabinet<br />role at least before this class is over.","William Willis (12%): I think there is a very<br />low chance that Elon will be in Trumps cabinet.<br />Elon has so much going on and is running multiple<br />companies. I don't think at the moment he has<br />the ability to take on being in his cabinet. He<br />has talked about in interviews how his mind is<br />like a warzone and I don't think having another<br />big responsibility is something that he would<br />like to do. I think that he will have a type of<br />administrative role but not actually be in the<br />cabinet.","Jeffrey Markowitz (70%): Trump has said that heis<br />going to do this, and it is expected.","Erin Ho (15%): Based on the articles that I’ve<br />seen about Donald Trump and Elon Musk, it appears<br />the Musk doesn’t want to be appointed as a cabinet<br />member and Trump acknowledges that. Rather than<br />have him as a cabinet member, Trump has talked<br />about implementing a suggestion of Musk’s, which<br />is a government efficiency commission. Musk would<br />likely be commissioned over there instead.","David Daniels (20%): It seems unlikely that<br />Donald Trump will appoint Elon Musk to a Cabinet<br />position. Although Trump has expressed interest in<br />working closely with Musk, it's doubtful that Musk<br />has the time to oversee his many business's while<br />also serving in a federal role. Additionally,<br />some betting markets have the same question and<br />they also suggest this skepticism regarding the<br />potential appointment. For these reasons, I assign<br />a 20% probability.","Ladi Fashogbon (0%): He support him, but there is<br />literally nothing that indicates that this will<br />happen when looking at research. What would he<br />even be advising for specifically?","Vikram Bharadwaj (20%): Elon in recent weeks has<br />discussed how he would want a more administrative<br />role within government rather than a cabinet<br />position. Being secretary of energy would also<br />require the senate to confirm him, and seeing<br />as he is a controversial figure amongst even<br />republicans (renewable vs fossil), I sincerely<br />doubt that he would be appointed to a cabinet<br />position. However, really, anything is possible.","Liv Payne (10%): Musk's support of Trump (and<br />Trump's subsequent desire to get the man as part<br />of his staff) is no secret. However, Trump has<br />said he does not want the man in his Cabinet,<br />instead in an administration role of some kind.<br />Musk himself has proposed a \"Department of<br />Government Efficiency\", which he would head.<br />Therefore, while these two are going to take full<br />advantage of their alliance, I don't think Musk<br />will join the Cabinet.","Carson Ankeny (1%): Briefing!","Minha Ahmad (20%): I doubt that Trump would<br />appoint Musk to his Cabinet, however, could see<br />him electing Musk to some other department. The<br />Hill has published that he is not expected to<br />hold a Cabinet position, but Musk has expressed<br />his interest in serving on a commission or other<br />department on government spending. Based on this,<br />I think that if Musk would have a role, Trump will<br />most likely elect Musk to a different department<br />rather than the Cabinet.","Alexis Frazer (25%): I feel like Musk’s business<br />empire requires his attention. Holding a<br />significant government position would demand<br />time and energy that could detract from his<br />responsibilities as CEO of multiple companies. It<br />would also be difficult to balance the interests<br />of private business with the ethics and duties of<br />a public office.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (8%): Most of the<br />information I found online revolves around the<br />fact that Elon Musk and Donald Trump have talked<br />about starting the Department of Government<br />Efficiency. The current Cabinet has 15 offices,<br />and very obviously those positions do not include<br />the Department of Government Efficiency. Elon<br />Musk has also expressed he is not interested<br />in being part of the Cabinet. The \"Department\"<br />they proposed would operate as a commission, so<br />not really an official Cabinet position. If Musk<br />were appointed to a Cabinet role, I honestly<br />do not know what it would be. I would go lower,<br />but I fear the consequences of this election and<br />anything can happen to be honest.","Jessica Armour (10%): I feel like it is very<br />unlikely to happen because Elon doesn't want to be<br />in the cabinet.","Franco Bravo (15%): I believe this is unlikely<br />to happen simply because of the fact that Elon<br />Musk is a business man at heart and I just don’t<br />think he will have the time to handle any sort<br />of official position and run his companies. I<br />do believe Trump will depend on him and seek his<br />advice on a several matters, but I don’t believe<br />that this will lead to an official position for<br />Musk","Colin Barry (21%): Elon has not expressed much<br />interest in taking a cabinet position so far. I<br />think that it would be unlikely for this to change<br />and that if he is appointed to a position under<br />Trump’s administration it would not be a cabinet<br />position.","Alex Vrolijk (20%): While Elon is very close with<br />Trump, he has expressed not wanting to hold a very<br />important role in his administration. However,<br />unsure what Elon in Trump’s administration will<br />look like, I chose 20.","Shayna Van Glish (20%): I think that the<br />probability of this happening is really low. Musk<br />has said he does not want to be in the cabinet. I<br />think that Trump will give him some other role.","Edward Tsui (15%): Elon has better things to do.<br />He would have to de-invest some of his private<br />ventures since they get government contracts, and<br />I don't think he is willing to do that. If he were<br />to work with Trump, it would be his newly created<br />department he wants.","Sara Whitmire (39%): Elon Musk has said himself<br />that he does not want to be on Trump\"s cabinet,<br />most likely because he is running Twitter and<br />probably has no plans to sell it. His schedule<br />also includes his other business ventures,<br />so there's probably not room for a government<br />position.","John Mathis (20%): Most talk had been around him<br />getting a specific commission, not a cabinet seat.<br />I’m assuming those will go to actual politicians<br />and not the CEO of three companies. He has been<br />very vocal about wanting a cabinet position and he<br />made a ton of campaign contributions, so maybe.","Reece Slater (18%): I think it is possible, but<br />very unlikely. The implications of a cabinet<br />position would be very complicated for Musk's<br />companies and I think it would be too demanding.<br />I think Trump would consider a separate commission<br />for him (DOGE), but I don't think a cabinet.","Leo Zegarra (31%): While I think Trump will<br />nominate Elon Musk to the cabinet, that is not to<br />say that Musk will actually take the job, which is<br />what I believe the question is actually asking. I<br />think the question only suggests that Trump will<br />outwardly go ahead and appoint him. To be honest,<br />I think Trump definitely is considering him for<br />cabinet and will nominate him but from what I<br />can tell, he will more than likely not accept or<br />necessarily be on the official cabinet.","Haley Ford (5%): I don't think Elon actually<br />wants to be on Cabinet, with his other business<br />obligations, maybe an advising position"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.80000000000000004,0.55000000000000004,0.65000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.55000000000000004,1,0.94999999999999996,0.97999999999999998,0.77000000000000002,0.75,0.80000000000000004,0.59999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.78000000000000003,0.84999999999999998,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.51000000000000001,0.95999999999999996,0.81000000000000005,0.90000000000000002,0.93999999999999995,0.90000000000000002,0.87,0.69999999999999996,0.76000000000000001,0.96999999999999997,0.94999999999999996,0.92000000000000004,0.80000000000000004],"y":[2.0331599049735813,1.9554110728902743,1.9949057075893506,2.0174069898668678,1.9554902285803109,2.0375667129876094,1.9702357357833535,1.9910620473325253,1.9837827381445094,1.9502494613640011,1.9550365516915917,1.9758750182110816,1.9887496398296207,1.9521399672608823,1.9828142182901503,2.0318756111199034,1.9909029594855383,2.010540001047775,1.9699026888236404,1.9905396739719436,1.9769670606823637,1.9851228322833776,2.0234746771864591,1.9513753170147539,1.9536618209676817,2.0476264770375563,2.0374407682567837,1.96082624765113,2.0005794747965409,2.0481787547469139,2.0308443974470718],"text":["Kira Liscombe (80%): Democrats currently control<br />the Senate but only by a very thin margin. There<br />are 34 seats up this year, and Republicans only<br />need a net gain of 2 to take control. It really<br />comes down to the battleground states such as<br />Montana and Ohio, where the GOP is optimistic<br />it will be able to flip control. A 538 asked<br />Who is Favored To Control The Senate found<br />that Republicans win control 88 times out of<br />100 in their simulations, and Democrats win<br />control 12 times out of 100. It seems like the<br />Republicans will end up having an edge in critical<br />battleground races for places like Montana,<br />Nebraska and Texas, which have already reported<br />early voting republican advantages.","Ryan Foley (55%): There are far more seats at risk<br />for the Democrats as well this year, however many<br />of them are safely held in blue states. Democrats<br />holding the majority comes down to maintaining<br />democratic senators in presidential battleground<br />states. Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan, and<br />Wisconsin all have senate elections this year, and<br />while they lean blue they could easily flip with<br />the presidential election. Democrats would also<br />need to pick up Senate seats in Texas and Montana.<br />Ted Cruz's seat is especially at risk with many<br />voters becoming fed up with his performance in<br />recent years, however, Texas is deep red so he<br />still has a chance to maintain his seat. Ohio is<br />a complete toss up as well and is also key for<br />Republicans gaining a majority.","Erin Ho (65%): Currently there are 34 Senate seats<br />up for reelection and 23 are held by Democrats or<br />Independents, meaning that the Republican Party<br />only has to win 2 to regain the majority. There<br />are a few states where the gap is narrow between<br />the candidates up for re/election, such as Ohio,<br />Texas, and Wisconsin, so it could go either way<br />for them and really change up the Senate. As<br />election day is the day after this question, we’ll<br />see what happens as it’s a tight race right now.","Carson Ankeny (95%): The Class 1 Senate map<br />is awful for Democrats. Defending 24 incumbent<br />Democrat/caucusing Independent seats for regular<br />election is \\extremely difficult, especially<br />with some crucial incumbents retiring. Meanwhile,<br />the Republicans are only protecting 10 seats,<br />which means they have much more space freed up<br />to attack incumbent Democrat seats. However, it<br />seems that most seats will remain in the control<br />of the incumbent party, with the exception of two<br />- the West Virginia seat held by the retiring Joe<br />Manchin will almost certainly flip, with popular<br />Republican Governor Jim Justice running for the<br />seat. Additionally, Senator Jon Tester of Montana<br />is polling far behind his Republican opponent,<br />and seems poised to lose a seat in a fairly<br />deep-red state. This map would end up being a<br />51-49 Republican majority, avoiding the potential<br />of the tiebreaking Vice President even coming into<br />play. For me, this is the most likely outcome,<br />and I don’t see many other seats coming into play.<br />According to 538’s election model for the Senate,<br />Republicans win 90 out of 100 times, and I find<br />myself in an even more confident prediction, that<br />there is a 95% chance that the Republican Party<br />wins the Senate.","Simon Gersten (95%): Whether you look at RCP,<br />Polymarket, or any of the polls, Republicans are<br />set to win a majority of seats in the Senate.<br />There are 7 tossup seats according to RCP, with<br />50 likely Republican. Of the 7 tossup seats,<br />Republicans are likely to win at least one.","Brooke Mcdermott (55%): Taking from 270 to win","David Daniels (100%): Virtually all polling<br />aggregators indicate that Republicans are certain<br />to achieve a decisive victory. Decision Desk HQ<br />estimates a 74% chance for the GOP, while ABC's<br />538 places that figure at 90%. RealClearPolitics<br />(RCP) also suggests that the GOP has an<br />undisclosed lead. If the Republicans manage to<br />lose any of the seats they are projected to win,<br />I believe that the General Election will still<br />likely grant them a majority in the Senate,<br />breaking the would be 50-50 split. For these<br />reasons, I assign a near 100% probability that the<br />GOP takes the senate in the 2024 election.","Abby Crowe (95%): I predict a 95% chance that<br />the Republican party will win the senate majority<br />due to current senators resigning, and close call<br />races. It will not take much for the republicans<br />to pick up the majority and therefore I find it<br />highly likely.","Vikram Bharadwaj (98%): Currently it is projected<br />by nearly every major outlet that the senate will<br />be republican in the coming election. The only<br />realistic way in which this doesn’t happen is<br />if Harris wins out big, however I find it highly<br />unlikely that even if Harris wins, it’ll be by<br />a large enough margin to influence them winning<br />the senate. On top of this, this is effectively a<br />re-election for the democrats, so having them win<br />big despite the current disapproval rating against<br />the administration implies that they would likely<br />not win the senate.","Shayna Van Glish (77%): I think that it is highly<br />likely that the Republican party will win a<br />majority of the seats in the senate this upcoming<br />Tuesday. Democrats cannot be counted out entirely<br />but with Manchin almost certain to be succeeded by<br />a Republican, the GOP needs to either pick up one<br />more Senate seat or win the White House to flip<br />the chamber. Due to this, I am giving it a 77%<br />chance.","Corinne O'Dell (75%): Republicans have a strong<br />chance of taking control of the U.S. Senate in<br />the upcoming election due to a combination of<br />favorable dynamics in key swing states, public<br />dissatisfaction with the current administration,<br />and strong candidate recruitment. Several seats<br />held by vulnerable Democrats are up for grabs<br />in battleground states like West Virginia,<br />Montana, and Ohio, where Republicans have popular<br />candidates and the electoral landscape leans<br />conservative. Moreover, rising concerns over<br />issues like inflation, energy policy, and border<br />security resonate with the Republican base and<br />many independent voters, giving GOP candidates a<br />potential advantage.","Minha Ahmad (80%): I think that it is highly<br />likely Republicans take control of the Senate. I<br />took a look at several different news sources and<br />polls to come up with my conclusion. In most of<br />my reviews, it has been found that the republicans<br />are positioned to win the majority of the Senate.<br />Democrats currently hold a 51-49 advantage, but<br />Republicans are likely to flip West Virginia and<br />Montana.","Jeffrey Markowitz (60%): Republicans are favored<br />heavily to win according to 538. I believe many<br />voting kamala are voting anti-trump and will still<br />vote for republicans on other parts of the ballot.","Liv Payne (90%): It seems like all news and<br />polls sources have reached a consensus that the<br />Democratic and Republican powers are going to<br />flip in this election: the Democrats will take<br />the currently Republican-led House, and the<br />Republicans will take the Senate. Also, according<br />to 270 To Win, Republicans are set to control 51<br />seats, whereas the Democrats will have only 48.","Franco Bravo (78%): I got my probability due to<br />several various forecasters and polls indicating<br />that there would be a republican victory. Of<br />course everything could be different especially<br />during these times, but I am confident in a<br />Republican victory in the senate","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (85%): 538 has it at<br />\"Republicans take control of Senate 90 times,\" so<br />that is why I put my probability so high. The Hill<br />also has a high forecast in favor of GOP. CNN made<br />an article about the top 10 Senate seats that are<br />most likely to flip, so that was useful in setting<br />my prediction.","Alex Vrolijk (95%): I believe the race currently<br />sits at 48-43 with Ted Cruz likely winning too<br />making it 49-43, favoring Republican control<br />of the senate. Even being charitable giving the<br />democrats Arizona and Nevada, the Republicans<br />would still only need 2 seats for control and<br />Montana and Nebraska look a lot more favorable<br />for Republican wins than any of the 4 remaining<br />toss-ups to the further east (WI, MI, OH, PA).","Jessica Armour (95%): most prediction sites lean<br />towards Republicans winning the Senate and favor<br />Nebraska to go red.","Findleigh Ague (51%): Democrats currently have the<br />majority in the Senate, but not by much (51-49).<br />The race in West Virginia is basically certain to<br />flip Republican because of Senator Joe Manchin's<br />retirement, and after that, Republicans would just<br />need to flip one more race, and they would have<br />the majority. There are several other states that<br />are considered battleground states for the Senate<br />election (some for the presidential election too),<br />so there are opportunities for Republicans to gain<br />the majority. A lot of the battleground states<br />are shown to be blue or leaning blue on 270toWin's<br />Senate Forecast Map, but the Ohio race looks<br />to be a toss-up, and is also the most expensive<br />race. It's going to be a close race, but I think<br />Republicans have a chance.","Colin Barry (96%): I think it’s very likely that<br />the Republicans take a majority as Democrats<br />are currently defending several swing states or<br />historically conservative states. The majority of<br />these seats are projected to flip which would give<br />a senate majority to the party.","Ladi Fashogbon (81%): In a simulation done by 538<br />says that just 9 times out of 100 that democrats<br />keep the majority. the 11 seats up for re-election<br />for Republicans are all strong (R) republican.","Matthew Harvey (90%): According to 270, many<br />forecasters are predicting that of the 34 seats<br />up for grabs this election, the republicans are<br />going to have a slim majority of the seats by<br />taking a final 51 seats. However to use 538, they<br />give Republicans an almost assured probability<br />of taking the Senate back. It should be noted<br />that a lot of these races are close, however the<br />trajectory is certainly heading in the Republican<br />Party's favors.","William Willis (94%): I gave the probability that<br />there will be 94% likelikood that the republicans<br />take the senate. Wrote a brief","Sara Whitmire (90%): West Virginia seems to be<br />leaning Republican. In a perfect world, Allred<br />flips Texas blue due to his debate performance<br />against Ted Cruz, but Tester and Brown are both<br />locked in.","Reece Slater (87%): It is very likely that<br />Republicans win the Senate. Democrats have to<br />either win in MT or OH, or some possibilities in<br />FL, TX, etc. Republicans will almost certainly<br />flip WV. The math points to Republicans winning.<br />538's simulations give Republicans a 91% chance<br />of taking the Senate. I hedged to 87 because<br />Polymarket gives them an 80% chance and I'm a man<br />of the people.","Haley Ford (70%): Consensus of different<br />forecasts/based on who is likely to flip","Leo Zegarra (76%): I believe that the Republicans<br />are more likely to maintain the majority share<br />of the Senate seats in this upcoming election. I<br />just think there are favorable conditions in the<br />battleground states and the polls suggest that the<br />Republican party will have the majority","Edward Tsui (97%): My probability is based on<br />Five-Thirty-Eight's simulation for the Senate<br />race, which predicted 91 out of 100 scenarios<br />where the GOP takes the senate. Polymarket and<br />Kalshi are around the 80% mark, and 270 to win<br />are predicting a GOP result as well. Crucial<br />seats up for election are Ohio, West Virginia,<br />Montana, which I believe will all lean red. I do<br />not find Texas nor Florida leading to complicated<br />scenarios. Pennsylvania will stay blue. Wisconsin<br />I am unsure of.","John Mathis (95%): All they have to do is net<br />2 total seats and they have the majority. West<br />Virginia is basically destined to flip and Montana<br />looks like it will be closer, but it seems like it<br />will flip. Barring an insane Texas race, it seems<br />like republicans will gain control of the senate.","Gracie Culpepper (92%): WV is pretty much a<br />guaranteed flip as is MT, and this is just very<br />likely to happen this election cycle.","Alexis Frazer (80%): The 2024 Senate map is more<br />favorable to Republicans, as several Democratic<br />incumbents are defending seats in states that lean<br />Republican or are closely divided. This increases<br />Republican chances of flipping these seats. The<br />party not holding the presidency often performs<br />better in midterms and general elections following<br />a presidential election, as voters sometimes<br />seek to balance power. This trend might boost<br />Republican chances in closely contested Senate<br />races."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,2.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,2.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Donald Trump appoint<br />Elon Musk to the Cabinet?","Will the Republican<br />Party win a majority of<br />seats in the US Senate<br />in the November general<br />election?"],"tickvals":[1,2],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Donald Trump appoint<br />Elon Musk to the Cabinet?","Will the Republican<br />Party win a majority of<br />seats in the US Senate<br />in the November general<br />election?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"12707b1447b1":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"127059fb71ac":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"12707b1447b1","visdat":{"12707b1447b1":["function (y) ","x"],"127059fb71ac":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I can only imagine what a<br />gut-wrenching choice this must be for President<br />Biden.","Joe Ornstein (8%): To date, South Korea<br />has supported Ukraine's war effort through<br />humanitarian aid and selling weaponry to Poland<br />and the United States (who in turn supply weapons<br />directly to Ukraine). Even with the direct<br />deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine, I<br />would be surprised if the South Korean government<br />responded by supplying weapons directly. President<br />Yoon has speculated that such a deal is \"on the<br />table\", but it is unclear the extent to which<br />he has the authority to make such a deal without<br />the approval of the National Assembly, which is<br />currently controlled by the DPK, a party that<br />actively supports friendlier relations with<br />Russia. A large majority of the South Korean<br />population (~80%) opposes supplying weapons<br />directly to Ukraine, and President Yoon's approval<br />rating is currently in the high teens following<br />a number of corruption scandals involving his<br />wife. And with US president-elect Trump promising<br />to reduce or eliminate support for Ukraine in<br />2025, there's the added pressure to avoid moves<br />that put the South Korean government at odds with<br />the US. I'm not an expert in Korean politics, so<br />I'm hedging a bit on the probability out of pure<br />epistemic humility, but this seems quite unlikely<br />to me."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,0)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.75],"y":[2.9632249732268976],"text":"Joe Ornstein (75%): The most recent CBO Economic<br />Outlook projects that federal debt as a percentage<br />of GDP will continue to rise in the coming years<br />as mandatory spending (e.g. Social Security,<br />Medicare, Medicaid) rises with an aging population<br />and net interest payments rise with higher<br />interest rates.

His<br />sentencing also takes place after the prediction<br />ends which is when Biden would be most likely<br />to pardon his son as he will know the length of<br />the sentencing. Should a pardon happen as well,<br />it will likely be met with backlash from both<br />Republicans and Democrats which could lead to poor<br />performance during the midterms in 2026. Taking<br />this into account Biden isn't likely to pardon his<br />son even though he may hold feelings of contempt<br />for the trial.","Kira Liscombe (10%): Biden has expressed<br />throughout his presidency a hesistation to<br />pardon his son. It would definitley have negative<br />implications for the Democratic Party if he did so<br />after a loss on the way out of office. The White<br />House said Thursday there are still no plans for<br />President Biden to pardon Hunter before leaving<br />office in the wake of President-elect Trump’s<br />victory. So, i dont think its likely.","Brooke Mcdermott (10%): I don't think is going to<br />happen soon for a number of reasons. Primarily,<br />the current ban on selling lethal weapons to<br />countries at war is still in place in South<br />Korea. Although the president said they can \"be<br />flexible\" he would still need the approval of the<br />National Assembly. Additionally, if they do decide<br />to sell a considerable amount to Ukraine it puts<br />them at immense risk to another upset with North<br />Korea. Although it may not be immediate, it could<br />increase and bolster tension between the two.","Abby Crowe (3%): I predict a 3% chance that Biden<br />pardons his son before Dec 1st. He has said pretty<br />explicitly that he won’t, and I think if he does<br />then he will do it at the very last second of his<br />term.","Abby Crowe (30%): I predict a 30% chance that<br />South Korea supplies weapons before December 1st.<br />I am not really sure about this one, but I think<br />the time frame is what lowers the chances. They<br />have said that they are open to sending weapons,<br />but they are acting in a very calculated manner so<br />I don’t think it will be in the next 20 days.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): Biden does not plan<br />on pardoning hunter, according to various news<br />outlets.","Jeffrey Markowitz (45%): Seems like a very small<br />time frame, and no developments on this.","Simon Gersten (1%): If this is to be done, it<br />won't be done by December 1st. Joe Biden is also<br />barely in control and only questionably sentient.<br />Pardons for family members who definitely<br />committed a felony is also a bad look for both Joe<br />Biden and Democrats in general, who are struggling<br />as is.","Simon Gersten (1%): Ukraine does not need South<br />Korean weapons and South Korea providing them with<br />weapons would only serve to escalate tensions with<br />North Korea, who is helping Russia. This would be<br />nonsensical and it would not help South Korea and<br />would only incrementally help Ukraine.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (5%): I wrote briefing!","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (1%): A CBS article from<br />3 days ago says \"Biden still does not plan to<br />pardon his son Hunter.\" Since the guilty verdict,<br />Biden has reiterated he will not pardon his son. I<br />doubt he would go back on his word.","Corinne O'Dell (10%): White House Press Secretary<br />Karine Jean Pierre has come out numerous times<br />stating that President Biden has no intention<br />of pardoning his son. Hunter Biden's trial is<br />not even occurring until Dec. 4, so depending<br />on how that goes, I could see a pardon happening<br />possibly, but it wouldn't be until January.","Gracie Culpepper (3%): This would be such a bad<br />decision, I don't think I even need to explain<br />why. He has already said he's not going to do it,<br />and I think this would really hurt the democratic<br />party after just receiving another large blow, and<br />I really don't think he would do this.","Gracie Culpepper (7%): Again, we're looking at the<br />amount of time left here. This is just a really<br />improbably thing to happen right now, not only<br />with the US election going red, and the limited<br />amount of time... very unlikely in my opinion.","Abigail Harris (3%): Despite foreign ministers<br />and the South Korean President giving various<br />vague answers about continuing to consider all the<br />options, I find it seriously unlikely South Korea<br />would begin to supply weapons to Ukraine before<br />December. In part because South Korea is already<br />offering some support to Ukraine indirectly<br />through the United States. Most of the issue lies<br />in North Koreas support of Russia and vice versa.<br />The fear is that if South Korea gets involved<br />on the opposite side from North Korea and Russia<br />there may be retaliation in the future.","Colin Barry (11%): I think it's highly unlikely<br />we see this as Biden has not seemed interested<br />in granting his son a pardon when asked thus far.<br />This also could further damage the current image<br />of the Democratic party which is another hurdle<br />they're likely hoping to avoid after the recent<br />election loss.","Erin Ho (5%): South Korea has a policy against<br />providing weapons to other countries in conflict.<br />While that could change in the face of North<br />Korea’s support of Russia in their conflict<br />with Ukraine, it would take time to plan it<br />as it requires money and manpower. There were<br />some talks, between Trump and the South Korean<br />President, about North Korea, but it doesn’t seem<br />like it could come in the near future.","Erin Ho (8%): According to many articles, Biden<br />has no plans on pardoning Hunter Biden as of right<br />now. It would be a great risk to the Democratic<br />Party right now, since they’ve lost the election<br />and have had many controversies with previous<br />President’s pardons. It would put them in a bad<br />spot, which is the last thing they need if they<br />have plans to make a comeback in the future.","Colin Barry (21%): South Korea has stated that<br />they are not yet ruling out the possibility of<br />sending weapons to Ukraine and that if they did<br />it would be primarily defensive weapons. I still<br />think the chances of any weapons being sent are<br />low based on possible escalation it may cause. I<br />also do not see any action like this being taken<br />until the new regime takes office in the U.S.,<br />which wont fit within the December 1st deadline.","Abigail Harris (5%): The White House has<br />repeatedly made statements denying any and all<br />claims that Joe Biden will pardon Hunter or<br />commute his sentence. Biden has an abysmally low<br />approval rating and being a sitting duck president<br />with a widely popular president elect coming in<br />in mere months it seems unlikely he would attempt<br />to exercise his power in such a controversial<br />way before leaving office, especially given the<br />criticism he and the Democratic Party have faced<br />as a result of this scandal.","Shayna Van Glish (15%): I do not think that it is<br />likely that President Biden will pardon his son.<br />Issuing a commutation or pardon for his son could<br />attract intense scrutiny within the democratic<br />party.","Shayna Van Glish (10%): I think that the<br />likelihood of this happening is really low.<br />Without further escalation, South Korea may take a<br />more cautious, longer-term approach","Liv Payne (5%): In his entire term, Biden has<br />pardoned 11 people. Compare this to Trump's 237,<br />it seems unlikely. Even though Hunter Biden is<br />his son, it still seems very unlikely that he will<br />be pardoned. The White House has also continued<br />to affirm that Hunter will not receive a pardon,<br />and as the year comes to an end, its likelihood<br />continues to dwindle.","Vikram Bharadwaj (10%): It seems fairly unlikely<br />that South Korea would do something so hasty with<br />just a few weeks left before the end of the year.<br />Most of the focus seems to be that the Korean<br />legislature wants to have a joint effort with<br />the US to provide weapons to Ukraine, and seeing<br />as how useless congress is right now, I find it<br />incredibly unlikely that South Korea would supply<br />weapons to Ukraine. The only reason why I haven't<br />gone with a 0 is due to how there is a chance that<br />SK could just do it themselves and start providing<br />weapons, especially if the war in Ukraine ramps up<br />due to the influx of NK soldiers.","Corinne O'Dell (10%): If South Korea were to<br />supply weapons to Ukraine, this could lead to a<br />massive escalation. South Korea's government has<br />expressed concern over the potential consequences<br />of supplying weapons, particularly the risk<br />of further damaging its diplomatic relations<br />with Russia, a key regional actor. Furthermore,<br />President Yoon Suk Yeol's administration has<br />emphasized that any shift in policy would require<br />careful consideration of the broader security<br />context, including potential provocations from<br />North Korea and Russia​.","Liv Payne (10%): With North Korea's recent<br />insertion into the Russian invasion of Ukraine,<br />South Korea has said it may join the fray in<br />defense of Ukraine. In October, South Korea<br />condemned North Korea's involvement, and said they<br />may intervene if needed. Now that North Korea has<br />been confirmed to have troops fighting against<br />Ukraine, South Korea may be forced to take action,<br />as Russia may help North Korea invade South next.<br />However, right now it seems like South Korea does<br />not have any plans to send weapons to support<br />Ukraine. They have merely said they have \"not<br />ruled it out.\" Therefore, I think it is still<br />highly unlikely at this time that South Korea will<br />prepare and supply weapons to Ukraine in less than<br />a month's time.","Vikram Bharadwaj (0%): Biden has already said<br />that he is not going to pardon Hunter Biden, and<br />given the whole storm that is currently occurring<br />with his endorsement of Harris. For him to do a<br />presidential pardon for his son would be perhaps<br />the worst stain on the Biden administration and<br />would dramatically tarnish Biden's own legacy.","David Daniels (0%): Simply put: no. A side note<br />if he did, I wouldn't even be mad. That would be<br />hilarious.","Alexis Frazer (10%): Highly unlikely for Hunter<br />Biden to receive an entire presidential pardon,<br />perhaps a sentence reduction.","David Daniels (0%): I find it more likely that<br />Biden himself fights on the front lines. The<br />closest whole number probability I could think of<br />was 0%.","Alexis Frazer (5%): Perhaps in the long term this<br />would be a more viable possibility, but currently<br />South Korea has only merely addressed the idea of<br />sending weapons with no concrete plans of action.","Minha Ahmad (10%): I do not think that Hunter<br />Biden will receive a presidential pardon from Joe<br />Biden. It is risky for the president to pardon his<br />own son and would reflect poorly on him and the<br />democratic party.","Matthew Harvey (5%): It is highly unfavorable<br />that Biden will pardon his son as he has stated<br />on numerous occasions that he is wanting to keep<br />his family and the federal government's pardoning<br />abilities separate. He is leaving the fate up to<br />the US Court System.","Minha Ahmad (20%): In the last week of October,<br />South Korea stated that they are considering<br />supplying weapons to Ukraine after North Korea<br />had deployed weapons to Russia. However, they have<br />a history of not supplying weapons to countries<br />in conflict, so if they will send. weapons to<br />Ukraine, I think it will most likely be after<br />December 1 and would take some time to go into<br />effect.","Matthew Harvey (5%): I believe that while South<br />Korea sees the new intelligence gathered regarding<br />North Korean involvement to be negative and<br />vulgar, I do not believe that they are going to<br />ramp up so suddenly and send their own troops to<br />assist Ukraine just yet. I think this is something<br />that they are going to have to really think about<br />and by the time they make the decision I don't<br />believe it'll be during this year. I think they<br />are waiting in anticipation for the upcoming<br />Presidential US term as Trump has had negotiations<br />with President Yoon.","Reece Slater (0%): The White House has<br />consistently said this is not happening. Also,<br />Hunter Biden is not set to be sentenced until<br />December 12th and if anything is going to happen,<br />I don't think it will happen until after then.<br />President Biden might do it as some last minute<br />thing, but I don't think by Dec 1.","William Willis (5%): I feel that it is very<br />unlikely that Hunter Biden will recieve a pardon<br />for the crimes that he has committed. At the<br />current moment the democrat party is under a lot<br />of stress from the election and is working to<br />rebuild themselves and this would not look good<br />on their end to pardon him. Biden also said ABC<br />news that he plans on the jury making the right<br />decision and not doing anything.","Reece Slater (10%): Possible, but very unlikely.<br />Such a short timeline for it to escalate that<br />much for South Korea to make this move. Also, they<br />have precedent of not selling weapons directly<br />to combatants, which I do not think they will<br />violate. See briefing.","William Willis (13%): I highly doubt that South<br />Korea wil supply weapons to Ukraine by Dec 1. I<br />think that they will eventually supply weapons<br />for them but not by Dec 1. South Korea has a long<br />standing policy of not supplying guns to a country<br />in conflict. It seems like South Korea would have<br />to think lond and hard if they wanted to do this<br />and it seems very unlikely for the timeline given<br />for the question.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): With waters hot still from<br />the election and no need to rush a presidential<br />pardon, I do not think President Biden will give<br />Hunter a pardon until after Dec. 1st if/when he<br />decides to. It’s less a matter of if this question<br />but when/if before Dec. 1st.","Alex Vrolijk (3%): Despite warning North Korean<br />that they might send weapons to Ukraine because of<br />troops in Russia, I do not think South Korea will<br />send aid any time soon if at all. Therefore, I<br />believe the possibility of South Korea sending any<br />weapons to Ukraine to be low.","Haley Ford (0%): The press secretary and Biden<br />himself said they would not, also- after the<br />Democratic party's loss to Trump, a pardon on the<br />way out of office would put more scrutiny on the<br />party","Findleigh Ague (5%): Basically everything says<br />that Hunter Biden will not receive a presidential<br />pardon. Last Thursday, the White House press<br />secretary reconfirmed this, which leads me to<br />believe that they're going to stick with this<br />decision. Maybe there's a small chance since<br />President Biden doesn't really have anything to<br />lose at this point, but he seems pretty consistent<br />with wanting to stick to the judicial process and<br />not interfere with his son's situation.","Victor Avila (70%): I think the likelihood of<br />South Korea supplying weapons to Ukraine before<br />december 1st is 70%. I think this is mostly due<br />to south korea wanting to respond to north korea<br />sending troops to help out the russians in the<br />russia-ukraine war. Sending weapons seems like a<br />safe bet considering they would only be sending<br />decommissioned equipment and it wouldn't change<br />the russian tactics.","Haley Ford (30%): There is a possibility, given<br />North Korea has sent troops to Russia. However,<br />South Korea will likely act slowly and cautiously,<br />given North Korea and Russia have an agreement<br />of sending troops, and South Korea would not want<br />Russian troops sent on their behalf.","Jessica Armour (5%): extremely unlikely that this<br />will happen within the next month.","Jessica Armour (5%): in an article posted by<br />NPR, it is mentioned that South Korea's president<br />stated “We have had a principle of not directly<br />supplying lethal weapons” to combatants, therefore<br />I think it is highly unlikely South Korea will<br />provide weapons to Ukraine.","Carson Ankeny (2%): This would be a very political<br />move by Biden. More so than anything he has a<br />respect for institutions and I think that even his<br />pardoning his own family wouldn’t come in the way<br />of that reverence.","Franco Bravo (15%): This is simply due to the fact<br />that President Biden has stated before that he<br />will not pardon his son. As of right now the white<br />house has not made any plans to. However, Trump<br />has been on radio shows signifying that he wont be<br />against it and he is open to the idea of pardoning<br />him, which could signify that it might not happen<br />during his term.","Findleigh Ague (10%): I think that South Korea<br />may supply weapons to Ukraine, I just don't know<br />if it will happen by December 1st. President<br />Yoon said that they will monitor North Korea's<br />involvement with Russia and decide how to act from<br />there. They said that if they do supply weapons,<br />that it would only be defensive ones, at least<br />to begin with. Something to keep in mind though<br />is that Russia said they will retaliate if South<br />Korea gets involved with the war. Also, Russia<br />and North Korea have signed a mutual aid treaty<br />in which they will supply troops to each other if<br />either are under attack. South Korean involvement<br />could cause North Korea to send more troops and<br />potentially have Russia send troops/resources to<br />North Korea as a form of this harsh reaction to<br />their involvement.","Edward Tsui (0%): President Biden has explicitly<br />stated he will not pardon nor commute his son<br />given the federal charges. I believe him this<br />time. It would be a bad look to back track on this<br />promise.","Franco Bravo (65%): South Korea has made it known<br />that it is not going to sit idle and watch North<br />Korea deploy troops into Ukraine and aid Russian<br />forces. I am confident that while they may not<br />send troops to Ukraine, they will certainly<br />provide military equipment and lethal weapons<br />to Ukraine now. From what I am aware it has sent<br />equipment to the US but not directly to the forces<br />in Ukraine, which I think will definitely change<br />now that NK has an active role in this war","Leo Zegarra (10%): South Korea has a policy of not<br />providing weapons to countries in conflict so I<br />really have just ruled this one out. Mainly, all<br />South Korea has said at this point is that they<br />are not ruling it out, but given that it is around<br />3 weeks from the deadline of this prediction,<br />I think it is an extreme long shot that this<br />happens.","Ladi Fashogbon (5%): “Our answer stands, which<br />is no,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told<br />reporters.\" The white house says they were not<br />going to pardon him, or at least there is no plan<br />to.","Carson Ankeny (25%): The involvement of NK in<br />Ukraine and the policies of the relatively hawkish<br />President Yoon could lead to this happening,<br />although unlikely. SK has a ban on providing<br />weapons to countries in active conflict (Ukraine)<br />however there have been recent talks about<br />removing these for this case. SK has important<br />economic ties with Russia, and had a deal<br />with Russia that they wouldn’t send weapons to<br />Ukraine if NK soldiers didn’t get involved, but<br />now here we are. Yoon sees NK as the ultimate<br />enemy and will want to fight them on any front,<br />and getting involved in Ukraine as a major<br />artillery manufacturer with the ability to rapidly<br />manufacture and fulfill orders (they are currently<br />ramping up production, Ukraine would be a sensible<br />receiver) would make sense.","Ladi Fashogbon (20%): I will say no more than a<br />20 percent chance, this is because south korea<br />has been warning about supplying weapons for a<br />few months now As of four days ago, they say that<br />they are not ruling out the idea of supplying<br />weapons However, supplying before december 1st is<br />unlikely.","Edward Tsui (5%): A lot of details are in the<br />air right now. I think 20-ish days is a quick<br />turnaround; it would be close to 40 since the<br />South Korean President's statement. First, Russia<br />and North Korea are denying the presence of North<br />Korean troops at the battleground. This kinda<br />plays into the statement that the South \" can\"<br />send resources, but the question is \"will they\".<br />Next, if South Korea were to provide any support,<br />it would probably not be modernized weaponry<br />nor troops unless something serious happens<br />between now and Dec 1st. At this rate, I don't<br />see anything major happening to warrant a higher<br />probability.","Leo Zegarra (10%): It is really more of a time<br />issue for me in this situation. It seems to be<br />that the White House has spoken on the matter and<br />claims that it will not happen, and given that<br />the deadline is also December 1st, it is even<br />less likely to happen. So, if it were to happen,<br />I still believe it will not occur before the given<br />time frame, especially since it's said that it<br />will not happen regardless.","Hayden Morehouse (1%): I do not see Biden going<br />out on a limb to do this for Hunter. It would<br />be a bad look for him and also december first is<br />rapidly approaching.","Hayden Morehouse (10%): I do not see this<br />happening in the next couple weeks.

US debt has been<br />stadily increasing and is reported to continue<br />rising into 2027, so i think theres a high chance<br />it will be higher than 120% in Q1 2027.","Brooke Mcdermott (90%): Data shows that the public<br />debt to GDP ratio is on a steady incline","Simon Gersten (10%): With faith in Elon Musk and<br />President Trump, they are likely to cut spending,<br />likely including funding for entire departments<br />and will also prioritize trade deals intent on<br />giving our country a decided advantage and net<br />economic benefit.","David Daniels (50%): I have no clue if it will or<br />wont. That being said, I will stay neutral on this<br />question.","Abby Crowe (50%): I predict a 50% chance that US<br />public debt will be higher because I genuinely<br />do not understand the ebbs and flows of the debt<br />enough to make this prediction. It seems like<br />the debt will grow under Trump because of his<br />policies, but we have been below 120 in recent<br />years so there is a chance it dips again I guess.","Ryan Foley (10%): The Congressional Budget Office<br />has stated in its June projections that debt would<br />reach a record 106% in 2027. This is far lower<br />than the threshold for the prediction, but it<br />still worrying. They've also given a look at 2034<br />and projected debt to be 122% of GDP then. There<br />will need to be a huge increase in spending in<br />the coming years in order to get to 120% by 2027<br />though. With the current track we are on now, and<br />Trump's plans to cut government spending I doubt<br />we will his 120% so soon.","Gracie Culpepper (97%): Currently, we are at 123%.<br />Debt is only going to continue to rise, I can't<br />think of any logical reason why this would not<br />occur.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (75%): In<br />\"visualcapitalist.com,\" it predicted the 2024 debt<br />to be ~125%, and it is ~5% off from the actual<br />debt. For 2027, it predicts it to be at ~137%.<br />FRED has it at ~128% which I believe to be more<br />realistic. It predicted 2024's to be at 121% which<br />is very accurate.","Alex Vrolijk (85%): With the latest Q2 2024<br />showing 120% down from peak 132% during Q2 2020.<br />However, with Trump in office I believe the<br />government will take in less revenue and although<br />cutting some discretionary spending, will allocate<br />it to others like a mass deportation plan. Trump<br />greatly added to the national debt last 4 years<br />he was president so I think by Q1 2027 it will be<br />worse.","William Willis (90%): I think that there is a<br />very high possiblility of this occuring. I beleive<br />that we will be doing a lot of spending on social<br />security and the possibility of a war. I think<br />that we are very likely to have a war in the next<br />5 years because of all of the conflict going on in<br />the world at the moment. I think that we will do<br />lots of spending on that and we will have to spend<br />a lot to incorporate a new system in replace of<br />Obamacare.","Corinne O'Dell (20%): The Congressional Budget<br />Office's June 2024 Budget and Economic Outlook<br />projected that debt would reach 99 percent of GDP<br />at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, a record 106<br />percent of GDP in 2027, and grow to 122 percent by<br />Fiscal Year (FY) 2034.","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): It is not projected<br />to reach that number until 2030, according to<br />CBO.gov.","Carson Ankeny (85%): The CBO projects that debt<br />held by the public will reach 106% debt to GDP<br />ratio by 2027, only eclipsing 120% by 2034. I<br />trust the CBO, I think they know what they're<br />talking about and they have a proven track record.<br />Also, this is a very predictable thing, as if<br />spending remains at similar levels (which it<br />likely will) then this is all projectable.","Ladi Fashogbon (100%): Basic graph analysis would<br />show that it is already near 120%. The trend line<br />shows that the data stays near the same every 5<br />years. It should be at or above 120 percent until<br />2028/9.","Erin Ho (80%): I think it will. As of right now<br />the debt as a percent of GDP is already above<br />120% and the total is projected to increase as<br />well. I wish I could find more sources to back up<br />this opinion, but I just think with the incoming<br />administration’s policies, it’ll get worse because<br />it was not good during that era.","Liv Payne (8%): It is predicted that US debt<br />will be around $40-42 billion, roughly 102%<br />of the national GDP. Because of how far out<br />the prediction is, I cannot make any confident<br />predictions, as the debt may suddenly increase<br />for any reason. After all, the pandemic caused<br />the debt to rise almost 30% in a single quarter.<br />However, I recognize that a pandemic is not<br />necessarily something that we'll see again within<br />the next 3 years, so I've kept my prediction low.","Abigail Harris (89%): The congressional budget<br />office projects the ratio in question to be higher<br />than ever by 2027.Rising interest rates aren’t<br />helping to lower the public debt and neither<br />are high trading deficits. As a silver tsunami<br />overtakes the United States, additional spending<br />for social security as well as Medicare do not<br />assist in bringing down the debt either.","Colin Barry (61%): Currently, the U.S. public debt<br />as a percentage of GDP is projected to finish be<br />higher than 120%. With experts placing it around<br />122%, however, I think this projection is just<br />slightly over and doesn’t guarantee it will be by<br />Q1 of 2027 so I only give it about a 61% chance.","Leo Zegarra (40%): There's a moderate likelihood<br />this threshold will be crossed, but it isn’t<br />guaranteed. I feel as though economic growth,<br />fiscal adjustments, and policy changes could<br />stabilize the ratio. Under Trump’s previous term,<br />debt levels increased slightly, but a similar<br />trend isn’t assured if adjustments are made in<br />spending or revenue. I believe Trump does want to<br />cut spending as well.","Matthew Harvey (10%): Current projections<br />by the US Senate committee on the Budget put<br />the debt to gdp ratio to be around 106% in<br />2027, and then eventually taking the 120%<br />around 2034. It should also be known that<br />things would have to change drastically for<br />these projections to skyrocket. Also with the<br />changing of administrations, republicans do<br />not like spending government money as much<br />as democrats do. While there are cons to not<br />doing so, this will slow down the rapid growth.<br />https://www.budget.senate.gov/ranking-member/newsroom/press/cbo-national-debt-to-reach-record-share-of-gdp-in-just-three-years#:~:text=Debt%20and%20Deficits%20Rise&text=Those%20five%20followed%20historic%20financial,2027%20and%20rise%20from%20there.","Victor Avila (40%): US public debt held by the<br />public as well as the by the federal government.<br />On one side, the Trump administration has pledged<br />to tackle rising housing prices which could<br />have an effect in lowering personal debt from<br />Americans. On the other side we will most likely<br />see increases in military spending which could<br />increase the deficit. It is currently 120%, and<br />I see inflation falling over the next year as<br />well as a smaller budget with the newly announced<br />Department of Government Efficiency which is<br />likely to cut funding to many agencies and<br />organizations.","Shayna Van Glish (65%): I think that it is likely<br />that the US public debt as a percent of GDP be<br />higher than 120% in Q1 2027. In the absence of<br />significant policy changes, high interest rates<br />and ongoing deficits suggest that the debt-to-GDP<br />ratio will probably exceed 120% by Q1 2027.","Reece Slater (10%): I don’t think so. Forecasts<br />that I have seen predict around 122% by 2034. I<br />assume a slow and steady growth, so I don’t think<br />it will be greater than 120% 7 years earlier.","Sara Whitmire (94%): Economics is not my<br />strongsuit, but from what I have read, it<br />seems like this will increase under the Trump<br />administration. Trump's plans for the economy seem<br />to be costly and his previous administration's<br />plans involved an increase in government spending<br />and brought the federal budget deficit up by about<br />50% and the national debt by 39%. With that being<br />said, the pandemic required emergency spending,<br />and a portion of the public debt total is due to<br />things like Social Security and Medicare, which<br />Republicans plan to cut back on, so there might<br />be a chance for a decrease, but I doubt that this<br />would be significant enough.","Findleigh Ague (95%): Im getting confused because<br />I swear everything says something different, but<br />it looks like that it’s pretty likely that by<br />2027, the debt percentage will be grater than<br />120%. CBO projects it to overtake its all time<br />high by 2027 and continue to rise from there.","Jessica Armour (80%): google predicts it will be<br />over 120% by 2027 and there already is a lot of<br />debt that the US has, so more than likely it will<br />be higher than 120%","Edward Tsui (70%): The congressional budget office<br />predicts a higher US public debt as a percent to<br />GDP in the future. This is also supported through<br />visual capitalist, which predicts the same result.<br />With an increasing deficit in government spending,<br />and reduction in economic growth, the story could<br />be probable. Whether Trump or Kamala had won, the<br />national debt was expected to explode. I am not<br />sure if Trump will address budget concerns with<br />his new efficiency agency with Vivek and Elon.","Minha Ahmad (75%): Based on how the current amount<br />of debt is slightly higher than this percentage, I<br />would predict that the rate would increase in the<br />coming years.","Franco Bravo (25%): This is all simply due to<br />several reports and other predictions I have<br />looked up aswell.

All indications<br />suggest that this is not true, and we're on track<br />to have 0.8% more CO2 emissions this year than<br />2023. But the trends underlying those optimistic<br />projections continue to hold. Emissions in<br />the United States peaked in 2007---spurred by<br />the transition from coal to natural gas and<br />renewables. The big question is whether China and<br />India will follow suit, and, if so, how quickly.<br />The dramatic decline in the cost of solar power<br />over the past decade is a promising trend, and<br />I think this is likely to produce accelerating<br />progress in the next five years.

Will we have<br />an AGI system that makes remote work by humans<br />obsolete by the end of the decade? Metaculus is<br />pretty bullish on this: over 1500 forecasters<br />there project something like a 70% chance we'll<br />see weak AGI by the end of the decade. I myself<br />am more skeptical, because in my view there are<br />fundamental limitations of deep learning models<br />(e.g. ChatGPT) that cannot be resolved just by<br />scaling them up. A few tasks I don't expect this<br />class of models to be able to accomplish *ever*<br />include: (1) copyediting textbooks with sufficient<br />accuracy that a publisher would be happy handing<br />off that task to a machine, (2) playtesting video<br />games, (3) replacing investigative journalists,<br />(4) writing good scientific papers...essentially<br />any tasks that requires extrapolation beyond the<br />corpus of data available on the Internet.","Joe Ornstein (85%): In the long-run, the ratio<br />of older Americans to working age Americans<br />will depend on three variables: life expectancy,<br />fertility, and immigration. But when thinking<br />about a six year time horizon, only immigration<br />matters (you can't create more 15+ year-olds<br />through increased fertility before 2030, and life<br />expectancy is unlikely to dramatically increase<br />or decrease the number of older Americans, absent<br />an epidemic roughly twice as deadly as COVID-19).<br />The Census Bureau makes several demographic<br />projections based on assumptions about the<br />rate of net immigration. But even in the \"high<br />immigration\" scenario, the 2030 projection *still*<br />has the age dependency ratio rising above 32% in<br />2030. Note that these projections were published<br />in 2023, and I think undercount the amount of net<br />immigration we've seen over the past two years<br />(see CBO report Figure A-4), but despite all<br />that, I find it difficult to believe that we'll<br />see anything near \"high\" rates of net immigration<br />over the next four years. Instead, our demographic<br />imbalance is likely to accelerate."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(34,139,34,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,NA)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.90000000000000002,0.75,0.59999999999999998,0.80000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.01,0.0050000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.01,0,0.14999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.050000000000000003,0.40000000000000002,0.080000000000000002,0.10000000000000001,0.050000000000000003,0.20000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0.31,0.65000000000000002,0.45000000000000001,0.19,0.55000000000000004,0.40000000000000002,0.25,0.33000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.02,0.25,0.90000000000000002,0.75,0.87,0.69999999999999996,0.65000000000000002,0.050000000000000003,0.94999999999999996,0.65000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.5,0.050000000000000003,0.98999999999999999,0.90000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.55000000000000004,1,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.65000000000000002,0.55000000000000004,0.10000000000000001,0.5,0.20000000000000001,0.55000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.25,0.28999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.59999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.75,0.34999999999999998,0.98999999999999999,0.88,0.88,0.80000000000000004,0.88,0.97999999999999998,0.98999999999999999,0.68000000000000005,0.90000000000000002,0.10000000000000001,0.84999999999999998,0.75,0.90000000000000002],"y":[2.9841179549926893,2.0090148873860016,0.95715680569410322,1.0058923439355567,0.95865874849259858,0.96138623543083668,1.005617097625509,0.95555285047739746,1.0466291965451091,1.0122775489697233,1.0180003550602124,0.98720384521875526,0.97975749764591458,1.0447598641738296,0.97047651950269942,1.0457889932906255,0.96554973209276795,0.96911521493457253,0.95650411837268623,0.9725712882587686,0.9761702895630151,0.99197236008476464,0.95692028156481679,0.97472940299194311,1.0033926783595235,0.98727726577781139,0.97818382037803531,1.0203077273676171,0.97982727214694021,1.0024215604411437,0.96774548897519708,1.0381066943751649,2.9555295692058281,3.0455049257958309,1.9763866281602531,1.9510685675544663,2.9600571949034928,3.0321034665452316,3.0179284511599689,2.029391278885305,3.0475667906226591,1.9966590356780216,2.9939149942947552,2.9861483504762871,2.043833840615116,3.009490995411761,3.0087033265037464,2.037235655845143,3.006927532237023,3.0379320375155658,2.9741071373689918,3.0014245200436562,3.045706299156882,2.9510588224977257,3.0121143009047957,3.0124076505657285,3.0032352449838071,3.0271878563798964,3.0147439753636718,2.9766246803337708,2.9904535443754865,3.0126029661856593,2.0460517524508761,1.990798646141775,1.9579665539087727,1.9976171222049743,1.9540698623051866,1.9580520501825958,1.9941329648718238,1.9893616731278598,1.9563429316040128,1.954511405294761,2.0178755970438944,2.0431112271267922,2.0225117652909832,2.0424914448522031,1.9641204552026466,1.9878204873297363,2.0428600301500408,1.9965344486990944],"text":["Kira Liscombe (50%): I'm basing this prediction<br />in part around my experience with AI. My first<br />semester in college, I had no idea what ChatGPT<br />was and thought it was crazy when a friend<br />explained to me that there was a website which<br />could asnwer any question. Now, I honestly use<br />it almost daily to asist with work/ just help me<br />answer things im curious about. We are also aready<br />seeing Tesla AI robots, which seemed far fetched<br />two years ago. Forbes reported that by 2030, AI<br />will be unfathomably more powerful than humans<br />in ways that will transform our world. WSJ also<br />reported that by 2030, AI will greatly enhance<br />the capability of robots to function independently<br />in complex environments. AGI would require<br />human-level learning/comprehension, and I expect<br />that we will see increasing breakthroughs on this<br />in the next 5 years. But, i cant say if its a<br />yes or no because its stil hard for me to picture<br />autonomous robots in our society.","Kira Liscombe (90%): According to the White House,<br />the US age dependency ratio has been increasing<br />since the mid-twentieth century and is projected<br />to continue to increase through the remainder of<br />the twenty-first century. Additionally, in 2030<br />all baby boomers will be older than 65. This will<br />expand the size of the older population so that<br />one in every five Americans is projected to be<br />retirement age. I could see it decreasing much<br />further down the line with increased education,<br />but dont think there will be a decrease enough by<br />2030 to become lower than 30%.","Haley Ford (75%): A lot of experts are saying the<br />emissions are likely to start falling beggining in<br />2024, given the rise of EV's and increase climate<br />policy worldwide.","Ryan Foley (60%): The IEA has found that CO2<br />emissions will peak by 2025, meaning that after<br />that point emissions will begin to come down.<br />This is thanks to renewable energy efforts and<br />many countries across the planet being committed<br />to lowering their emissions. With developing<br />technologies emerging in the coming years, it will<br />become easier to be less reliant on fossil fuels<br />which will help lower emissions further. However,<br />I have the probability fairly low because with<br />Trump in office, the US is likely to increase its<br />emissions. His new cabinet appointment for the<br />EPA does not believe in climate change and Trump<br />is likely to pull us out of the Paris Climate<br />Agreement.","Abby Crowe (80%): I predict an 80% chance that<br />emissions will be lower. IEA projects that<br />the peak of emissions will be at the latest in<br />2025, therefore I think it is highly likely that<br />emissions in 2028 will be lower than this year.","Edward Tsui (30%): There are sources that predict<br />that we could begin to see a reduction in carbon<br />emissions beginning this year. However, we<br />have seen a general massive increase in carbon<br />emissions in the last 100 years. Global Warming is<br />still a threat. Regardless of a timeline of 2030<br />to split the carbon emissions in half, I think<br />2028 is a hopeful estimate. Very much possible but<br />I find it unlikely.","Brooke Mcdermott (1%): There is notably slow<br />growth in emissions, which is a sign that we<br />are working towards a deficit. But I don't think<br />we're there yet. Also, so many countries are<br />attempting to decrease emissions where as others<br />could honestly care less. I don't think it's going<br />to be any lower, and it's more probable that the<br />emissions rate is going to increase steadily or be<br />stagnant at some point.","Liv Payne (0.5%): CO2 emission levels have been<br />rising for as long as humans have been able<br />to produce them en mass via industries like<br />transportation, agriculture, electrical power<br />production, etc. Each year, this number is \"record<br />setting\". Even during a pandemic, during which<br />a lot of people were staying home and producing<br />less CO2 output, the number was still high at the<br />end of 2020. I allowed 0.5% for fun, but I really<br />believe that the likelihood of CO2 emissions<br />dropping in 4 years from now is basically<br />impossible.","Corinne O'Dell (10%): It’s unlikely that global<br />CO2 emissions will be lower in 2028 than in 2024<br />because of ongoing challenges. Many countries<br />are slow to fully adopt climate policies, and<br />developing nations still rely on fossil fuels for<br />energy. Political conflicts, lack of funding for<br />green projects, and opposition from industries<br />also make progress difficult. Without major<br />changes, significant emissions cuts by 2028 are<br />unlikely.","Abigail Harris (1%): We, the United States, are<br />currently on track to meet none of our climate<br />change goals or targets. Climate change research<br />and funding was not a major policy for either<br />Presidential candidate and we are the largest<br />emitter of free gases. China is the largest<br />emitter of CO2. We are facing an increase in<br />population and energy demand without similarly<br />developed policies to work against emissions. We<br />don’t have the infrastructure of science or care<br />to keep up with our own carbon emissions now,<br />and it looks as though there is no real change of<br />status quo on the near horizon.","Simon Gersten (0%): The world is not on track for<br />this and there is very little progress towards<br />this goal. International agreements have held<br />little bearing and have had little influence on<br />many countries that are heavy polluters. There<br />is a likelihood we will be more on track to<br />begin to lower emissions but as of now this is an<br />implausibility.","Kira Liscombe (15%): I found information stating<br />that if global energy demand continues to grow<br />rapidly and we meet it mostly with fossil fuels,<br />human emissions of carbon dioxide could reach<br />75 billion tons per year or more by the end of<br />the century. We see rising CO2 levels every year<br />despite some advancements in renuable energy. On<br />top of this, Trump rolled back climate regulations<br />and pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement<br />during his first term. I read an article stating<br />Trump’s election could lead to an additional 4bn<br />tonnes of carbon dioxide US emissions by 2030,<br />compared to continuing current-president Joe<br />Biden’s plans. So, it seems very unlikely to me<br />that global CO2 emissions will be lower in 2028<br />than in 2024.","Erin Ho (40%): Likely not, because there’s a<br />lot of effort that must be put forth by states<br />and corporations. Things like adopting renewable<br />energy, passing legislation to meet goals, and<br />reducing the use of fossil fuels are what come to<br />mind when lowering emissions. However, it comes<br />down to how governments and corporations view<br />climate change, as there are nonbelievers out<br />there, and if they’re willing to put the work in<br />to get it down.","David Daniels (5%): All signs point to no, says<br />the magic 8 ball.","Hayden Morehouse (40%): With the new legislation<br />coming out every year and more clean energy<br />options for corporations I could see this being<br />a real possibility. Investor sentiment is also<br />becoming higher and higher for green corps and I<br />think this could convince some of these to become<br />cleaner.","William Willis (8%): I believe that global CO2<br />emissions will not be lower in 2028 than they are<br />in 2024. With the relevance of data centers and<br />increased housing in the United States I believe<br />that it will be substanitally higher. I think that<br />America will also have a lot more manufacturing<br />plants in the future and that will cause an<br />increase in emissions. I also believe that<br />electric vehicles will stop being produced because<br />they are not sustainable for the long term","Jeffrey Markowitz (10%): Global emissions are only<br />rising every year. Efforts are being made to limit<br />them however industry is expanding also. Seems<br />very unlikely unless something big happens.","Vikram Bharadwaj (5%): Currently we are riding<br />off the back of record high CO2 emissions in<br />2022, and while many states are working towards<br />more renewable sources of energy, it is becoming<br />clear to me that more and more states will still<br />be heavily reliant on non-renewable sources like<br />fossil fuels, well into the 2030s, making it clear<br />to me that emissions will not be decreasing any<br />time soon.","Reece Slater (20%): I don't think so. Most of the<br />forecasts I've seen have it higher in 2028 unless<br />we lock in, which I don't think will happen.","Franco Bravo (70%): One of the main reasons as<br />to why I’m confident that will go down is that<br />countries will lead away from fossil fuels and<br />reinvent into renewable energy. Furthermore<br />legislation and policy commitments will add<br />further restrictions and intent to lower<br />emissions.","Carson Ankeny (20%): While many countries have<br />instituted measures to encourage more renewable<br />energy adoption, technological advancements, and<br />net-zero commitments, I just don't find it likely<br />that these can realistically offset growing energy<br />demands.","Leo Zegarra (31%): I believe the trend is that<br />global emissions are tied to economic growth,<br />especially in developing countries. Truthfully,<br />I just don’t see a significant reduction in just<br />four years.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (65%): About 6 days ago,<br />CO2 emissions were expected to increase. I doubt<br />that under Trump the US will prioritize reducing<br />CO2 emissions, and I’m not sure how the rest of<br />the world will operate.","Colin Barry (45%): The current goal is for<br />CO2 emissions to peak before 2025 to prevent<br />irreversible damage in the coming years. Current<br />policy seems to be making that goal more likely<br />and if it is achieved than it is safe to assume<br />emissions may be at least slightly lower 4 years<br />from now.","Sara Whitmire (19%): Lowering emissions is barely<br />happening in 2024, and apparently emissions will<br />be net zero by around 2050. I think 4 years won't<br />make much difference, and at least in the US we<br />will be making little to no progress/making things<br />worse.","Minha Ahmad (55%): CO2 emissions are expected to<br />decline by 2028 and there are plans set in place<br />for the reduction.","Ladi Fashogbon (40%): Briefing!","Matthew Harvey (25%): While it should be important<br />to understand the advancements of alternative fuel<br />sources and clean energy, I don't believe that<br />the emissions are going to go down more. According<br />to the world emissions clock, the emissions will<br />reach new highs in 2024, and unless significant<br />change is going to occur, I don't forsee that<br />happening","Findleigh Ague (33%): In order to keep the planet<br />from global warming in the second half of this<br />century, CO2 emissions need to be lower in 2028<br />than they are now. If we're supposed to be at net<br />zero or carbon neutral by 2050, there needs to<br />be conscious efforts made right now. Countries<br />legally bonded by the Paris Agreement have to<br />submit their nationally determined contributions<br />(NDCs) by February 2025, and these goals have to<br />be completed by 2035. The IPCC says that current<br />NDCs are not ambitious enough and will not have us<br />on track to complete our goals. Global emissions<br />need to be reduced by 23% by 2030 in order to be<br />on track to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees<br />C. Emissions need to be lower four years from now,<br />but I'm not sure they will be.","Jessica Armour (30%): emissions are more than<br />likely going to be higher in 2028 than they<br />currently are","Gracie Culpepper (2%): With the rate we're going<br />now, this is so unlikely. This would require for<br />significant changes to be made right now towards<br />a cleaner environment, which just isn't going to<br />happen (especially with Trump probably about to<br />withdraw us again from the Paris Agreement). I<br />just think this is incredibly doubtful.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): I think that global CO2<br />emissions will be higher in 2028. Current national<br />climate plans are not enough to reduce global<br />greenhouse gas emissions.","Gracie Culpepper (90%): I think the only way<br />this doesn't happen is if the government bans<br />advancements of AI, but even then that would just<br />be a particular country and not the whole world.<br />AI is already better than humans, we just haven't<br />found a super realistic physical model to support<br />it as a system.","Ryan Foley (75%): Sam Altman estimates that we<br />will have AGI as early as next year. However,<br />other people are speculating that it could take as<br />late as 2050. With current LLM models, we struggle<br />with preventing them from going crazy. However,<br />the speed at which we're developing AI models<br />makes it likely that we could see exponential<br />growth in the development of AI. By using AI<br />to further its own development, we could likely<br />create AGI by 2030. Tech leaders like Nvidia are<br />also committed to integrating AI into most aspects<br />of their business and further funding development.<br />The government is also likely to become involved<br />in subsidizing research as well, speeding up the<br />rate of development.","Gracie Culpepper (87%): It's already above this<br />number right now, and with more of the Boomer<br />generation reaching that age I think it will<br />continue to grow. My only hesitation is the<br />fact that more Boomers will also have passed<br />away by this point, which will thereby lower the<br />dependency ratio as well.","Hayden Morehouse (70%): see briefing","Erin Ho (65%): I did a briefing.","Vikram Bharadwaj (5%): To me it seems more and<br />more like companies involved with artificial<br />intelligence are going to be more and more<br />regulated by governments due to the sheer amount<br />of potential AI has. Having a Human-like AI,<br />from my understanding, is seeming more and more<br />like science fiction. No matter how big the data<br />set, AI will always be artificial, and I fail to<br />imagine a realistic future in which we share the<br />same earth with human like AI.","Brooke Mcdermott (95%): AI is progressing at a<br />rapid speed, a lot of predictions say it will<br />develop to Altman's definition by 2027, so I<br />definitely think it will have extremely advanced<br />capabilities by 2030.","Brooke Mcdermott (65%): I think numbers are bound<br />to change but the current estimate is at 33.4%,<br />which could change with future events.","Abby Crowe (20%): I predict a 20% chance that<br />AGI will be achieved by 2030. We are only 5 years<br />out from that deadline, and encompassing human<br />intelligence completely into a robot just doesn’t<br />seem real to me. I consulted AI itself to help<br />me come to this conclusion and even Chat was not<br />confident.","Abby Crowe (50%): I predict a 50% chance that the<br />age dependency ratio will be higher then 32% in<br />the 2030 US Census because the prediction is right<br />at 32% from the bureau. I wasn’t really able to<br />find any information to sway this for me.","Haley Ford (5%): As our forecasts jump more years,<br />it becomes harder to predict things with accuracy.<br />However, I often feel like in the technology<br />space, future projection can be to bullish/less<br />realistic- especially when the views about the<br />future/AGI come from the CEO of a AI company.<br />Having AI advance to the level of near humaness is<br />not out of the span of imagination. Though I think<br />this could be developed to some by 2030- I don't<br />necessarily think it will be implemented. Opinions<br />differ-some say in 2 years, some say in decades.","Carson Ankeny (99%): I work for an AI company<br />part-time, helping to correct mistakes and review<br />and improve models. The company I work for is<br />contracted by several AI companies trying to<br />develop AGI, and we review responses from their<br />models. Because of this, I've been able to have<br />access to experimental versions of several models<br />(I can't name them specifically) and even within<br />the year that I've been working there I've seen<br />many of them vastly improve. Sam Altman thinks<br />we'll have AGI by 2025. I'm more conservative than<br />that, I think it will take longer (2027, 2028) but<br />there are already many experimental models that<br />don't have public access that are getting closer<br />and closer to the definition of what AGI is, and<br />I think it's a near certainty that it will be<br />achieved within the next 6 years.","Carson Ankeny (90%): In an article from the Pew<br />Research Center in 2008 - \"The elderly dependency<br />ratio was 20 people ages 65 and over for every<br />100 people ages 18 to 64 in 2005. That ratio<br />has risen slightly since 1960 (from 16 per 100)<br />and will increase rapidly (to 32 per 100) until<br />2030, when the youngest of the baby boomers<br />turns 66. The elderly dependency ratio will level<br />off at 32 elderly per 100 people of working age<br />through 2050.\" This projection is in line with<br />what has happened in reality since the article<br />was published in 2008 - the ratio currently sits<br />at 27%, and I expect it to continue to grow as<br />baby boomers age. It is very easy to project the<br />aging of this elderly population when compared<br />to population change in general, because the<br />elderly are already part of the population, and<br />their numbers are very predictable as they age<br />into the category of \"elderly\". However, I only<br />give this an 90% chance because it is projected<br />to be exactly 32% and to plateau there by Pew, and<br />there could be factors (immigration) that could<br />lead to a larger increase in overall working-age<br />population than Pew projected. However, with<br />Trump being slated to serve from 2025-2029,<br />a substantial increase in immigration seems<br />unlikely.","Reece Slater (60%): I have solid hopes. AI has<br />been rapidly advancing the past few years and many<br />of the top tech and AI experts and CEOs are very<br />encouraging of AGI by 2030. See briefing.","Jeffrey Markowitz (60%): AI is steadily advancing,<br />and very rapidly.","Jeffrey Markowitz (55%): Ratio is expected to rise<br />over the coming years.","David Daniels (100%): With the rapid pace of<br />technological advancement over the past decade, I<br />believe it's reasonable to consider Sam Altman's<br />definition of AGI not just inevitable, but<br />imminent. If this question remains unresolved by<br />Q3 of 2029 and you notice me stepping away from<br />my multi-million-dollar career, rest assured—I'll<br />be on the frontlines, fighting to protect my Brier<br />score.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): I think that it is<br />likely that AGI will develop by 2030 due to the<br />technology and resources that are going into<br />creating it. More in my briefing.","William Willis (85%): I think that this is<br />very likely to happen with Elon and Sam Altman<br />collarborating together. Elon has stated that<br />he believes that the future consist of everyone<br />having their own personal robot to complete tasks<br />for them. WIth Elon's ability to raise money I<br />believe that the sky is the limit when it comes to<br />getting things done. Everything he has said he has<br />wanted to do he has completed.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (30%): We recently<br />developed the AI models that a lot of people<br />use. Given how recent they are I think it will<br />take some time for us to become experts using the<br />generative AI we have. I think technology might<br />also need to catch up.","Alexis Frazer (65%): Briefing","Edward Tsui (55%): There is a big difference<br />between development and being readily available<br />to the market. I believe we will have AGI by Sam's<br />definition developed by 2030, but I think it will<br />be kept secret until a year or two of its release.<br />I think by 2040 is a more reasonable timeline, but<br />it is hard to quantify existential R&D with AI.","Abigail Harris (10%): I think to see such broad<br />workforce changes before 2030 would be unlikely.<br />Right now AI I s a tool we know is used to spread<br />misinformation rather unintentionally or not. To<br />prefer work produced by AI to such an extent that<br />we rely on it with little bureaucratic safety<br />measures like a significant number of hired human<br />eyes seems vastly unlikely.","Colin Barry (50%): Tech experts seem torn on the<br />subject currently. Not just if we can achieve it<br />by 2030 but whether it is actually achievable at<br />all. I think it’s probably a toss up with how fast<br />ai has developed recently.","Matthew Harvey (20%): While technology is<br />advancing at an accelerated rate, I think ai<br />will take a hit in the next decade surrounding<br />everyone’s skepticism. Boomers and Gen Y are not<br />quite as accepting of technology and will probably<br />stalemate anything with ai and its dangers (most<br />think it’s a scheme and dangerous).","Sara Whitmire (55%): With the current rate of AI<br />usage, I expect AGI to be at least developed, if<br />not prevalent, by 2030.","Ladi Fashogbon (30%): Briefing!","Leo Zegarra (25%): I feel like while AI is<br />improving fast, creating a machine with human-like<br />intelligence is very difficult. I feel as though<br />building true AGI will take more time due to the<br />many challenges that arise.","Findleigh Ague (29%): Sam Altman says that OpenAI<br />will have AGI by 2025, but I think this seems<br />like a lofty goal. From what I have seen, the<br />expected capabilities of AI by 2030 don't meet<br />the standards of AGI. Robots will gain more<br />independence, AI will be further integrated into<br />healthcare, AI will further automate tasks and be<br />able to collaborate, and AI-generated content will<br />be even more realistic. I think that AI still has<br />a lot of development left before we can reach AGI<br />levels, and I think it's going to take longer than<br />5 years, considering the current goals and plans<br />for AI's capabilities in 2030.","John Mathis (20%): AI, while relatively new, has<br />made progress at break-neck speeds. It started<br />with image generation that has slowly become<br />more and more accurate, And most recently large<br />language models have been able to access the<br />internet. So, it seems we are getting closer to AI<br />being better at any human task, but I do believe<br />there is one major roadblock: reasoning. AI can<br />generate information that is often correct, but it<br />has no ability to reason *why* certain information<br />is right or wrong. This is crucial for literally<br />every task, and until AI had that ability, I don’t<br />think it’s going to take over like people think it<br />is.","Jessica Armour (80%): did brief, its extremely<br />likely","Minha Ahmad (60%): As of 2023, the age dependency<br />ratio is 55.47%. In addition, in according to the<br />most recent census, the age dependency ratio is<br />expected to be slightly higher than one third by<br />2060. So, although it is projected to decrease,<br />I believe it will still remain above thirty two<br />percent, especially since it is currently above<br />fifty percent.","Ryan Foley (65%): The census predicts that in<br />2030, about 42% of the population will be the<br />age of dependents. That is under 15 and over 64.<br />This is combined with declining birthrates in<br />the US as well, which makes that number slightly<br />lower. However, with Trump entering into office,<br />we could see abortions being harder to come<br />by, as well as some contraceptives. This could<br />increase the birthrate, seeing that JD Vance is<br />committed to his attacks on childless families.<br />With efforts like this, we could see an increase<br />in young dependents which will in turn increase<br />the dependency ratio. As of now, using current<br />population growth rates we are still on track to<br />meet at least an age dependency ratio of 32%.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): I think that it is<br />really likely that the age dependency ratio will<br />be higher than 32% in the 2030 US census. Baby<br />boomers will be turning 66 at this time, making<br />there be a big increase in the percentage of<br />people that are 65 and up.","Simon Gersten (35%): Explained in brief.","Vikram Bharadwaj (99%): Currently the U.S. Census<br />Bureau and other studies estimate that the age<br />dependency ratio could exceed 35% by 2030, due<br />to shifting demographic trends, so the likelihood<br />that its greater than 32% is almost certain. The<br />increase in the senior population is the primary<br />driver, and while youth dependency might remain<br />stable or slightly decline, it won’t offset the<br />growth in older dependents (tldr: boomers are<br />getting more boomery, genx is getting up there,<br />and millenials and genz have to pick up the slack<br />since the previous two generations are living<br />longer than ever before in history).","Ladi Fashogbon (88%): The baby boomer generation<br />turns 66 in 2030. All baby boomers will be older<br />than 65 and more and more people emigrating to the<br />US.","William Willis (88%): Wrote a brief","Matthew Harvey (80%): Old People are Living Longer<br />and a decline in Birth Rates will not interfere<br />with Old People. Also wrote a briefing","Reece Slater (88%): I think so. Elderly population<br />is rapidly increasing and life expectancy is<br />increasing as well. See briefing.","Liv Payne (98%): Currently, the dependacy ratio<br />in the US is nearly 55%. A report by the White<br />House demonstrates that this number has increased<br />97% from 1950 to 2021, and it's only going to<br />keep increasing. Data also reports lower births,<br />meaning, as the population continues to age, there<br />are fewer people growing up into the \"working age\"<br />group than there are aging out of it.","Edward Tsui (99%): The US census predicts its own<br />old age dependency ratio to be 35% by 2030. Pew<br />research predicts steady at 32%. I will lean on<br />the over heavily.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (68%): As life expectancy<br />and the older population increase, the age<br />dependency ratio will increase. Since 2008, the<br />age dependency ratio has increased and not shown<br />signs of decrease, so I believe that by 2030 it<br />will reach 32%.","Abigail Harris (90%): The age dependency ratio<br />is already expected to reach 35% by 2030. As<br />life expectancy increases and the silver tsunami<br />continues aging, more people will become older and<br />stay older for longer. In addition, birth rates<br />have been declining not just in the U.S. but on<br />a global scale. This leaves a shrinking younger<br />portion of the working age population.","John Mathis (10%): see briefing","Colin Barry (85%): From what I can see, the age<br />dependency ratio in the U.S. is already higher<br />than 32%. I see no reason why it would fall so far<br />as more and more people will have aged into that<br />category by 2030.","Haley Ford (75%): This is on par with projections,<br />given smaller fertility rates, baby boomers aging,<br />increased life expectancies.","Findleigh Ague (90%): The Census predicts that the<br />age-dependency ratio for seniors will be 35% by<br />2030, and considering that as of 2023 we are at<br />27%, I think that it is feasible for it to get to<br />30% by 2030, even if it doesn't reach the expected<br />ratio of 35%."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will global CO2 emissions<br />be lower in 2028 than in<br />2024?","Will the age dependency<br />ratio be higher than 32%<br />in the 2030 US Census?","Will we develop an<br />Artificial General<br />Intelligence by 2030?<br />(Sam Altman's definition)"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will global CO2 emissions<br />be lower in 2028 than in<br />2024?","Will the age dependency<br />ratio be higher than 32%<br />in the 2030 US Census?","Will we develop an<br />Artificial General<br />Intelligence by 2030?<br />(Sam Altman's definition)"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"12701e815dfd":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"12703e1e55ee":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"12701e815dfd","visdat":{"12701e815dfd":["function (y) ","x"],"12703e1e55ee":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The main thing that<br />keeps Professor Ornstein in first place is<br />the experience. While all of the students are<br />counteracting hedging in week three and learning<br />the value of re-reading their past briefs,<br />Professor Ornstein has been familiarizing himself<br />with these methods for going on three semesters<br />now. It’s the predictions at the beginning that<br />demonstrate this best. While the class average can<br />be accurate or even more accurate than Professor<br />Ornstein's, a majority of individual students will<br />not be.","Reece Slater (0%): Dr. Ornstein is a genius. See<br />briefing.","David Daniels (0%): gg","Carson Ankeny (1%): I don’t think that the math<br />works out given the current Brier scores and the<br />outstanding predictions unless something truly<br />crazy happens and Professor Ornstein gets a ton<br />wrong. The closest behind him on the leaderboard<br />have too similar of positions on the outstanding<br />predictions.","Findleigh Ague (5%): Dr. Ornstein is currently in<br />first place and .613 points ahead of the student<br />in second place. There are still a good amount<br />of forecasting questions that haven't resolved<br />yet, so they will automatically do so when<br />December 1st comes, so there could be chances for<br />people to get ahead. I went through all of the<br />forecasting question responses, and out of all<br />of the forecasts, he placed 25 of them at more<br />extreme levels (>20% or <80%), which I think has<br />really helped him get ahead. I'm not sure how long<br />he has taught this class, but with his experience<br />from forecasting in following semesters for this<br />class and probably for a while before teaching<br />this class too, he clearly has had time to develop<br />strategies and learn the steps to forecasting<br />accurately. I'm not sure if anyone will be able<br />to get ahead because they would have to have been<br />really accurate on the yet-to-resolve-forecasts,<br />and they would have to be more accurate than Dr.<br />Ornstein.","Haley Ford (23%): Looking at his current score,<br />and which predictions have yet to resolve to yes,<br />his brier score is likely to remain top of the<br />pack.","John Mathis (0%): David, the only student who<br />has a chance of beating you, ran the numbers. You<br />guys have too close a position on the outstanding<br />questions for him to take back the lead.","Franco Bravo (5%): Due to the fact that there are<br />not any predictions left, and the fact that most<br />of the time, most people are on the same side as<br />the professor. the rankings will not change and<br />the professor will stay in first place with the<br />best briar score in the class.
