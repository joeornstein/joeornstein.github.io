But it's a squeaker;<br />the temperature in Athens usually dips<br />below freezing only a *few days* before<br />Nov 29. This one will be a real nail-biter.<br />https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ga/athens/KAHN","Ryan Wolkofsky (20%): Looking at last year's<br />weather, the temperature in Athens dropped below<br />32F a decent amount of times. However, none of<br />those came before November 29th. With the planet<br />warming each year, I do not see the temperature<br />getting lower this year than last year. Also, I<br />live in Charlotte, NC, and am familiar with the<br />climate of this region, The temperature tends to<br />get cold around the 2nd or 3rd week of December<br />but can stay in the 50s through New Year's Day.","Victoria Harrill (35%): It is not common for<br />Georgia to get below freezing before December.","Jacob Fortner (25%): From how hot it has been the<br />past few years during wintertime and from the heat<br />of this year so far, I am not confident that there<br />will be a point in time before the end of the<br />semester where the temperature in Athens, GA with<br />drop below freezing.","Maggie Fertig (30%): It is very rare that it gets<br />this cold in Athens in November, especially with<br />global warming. However it is possible to get cold<br />at night towards end of November month.","Duy Do (5%): Because the temperature has not been<br />dropped below 32F for many years","Kang Lee (10%): As we live in GA based on past<br />weather patterns and current forecasts for the<br />future it s very unlikely that the temperature<br />will drop below freezing unless a flash cold front<br />were to appear out of the blue.","Simryn Patel (15%): It has been very hot this year<br />and later years have not gotten that cold at all","Hita Boddu (25%): It usually doesn't get that cold<br />until December / January.","Rease Bauer (20%): I know nothing about athens<br />weather but from what i have heard it stays mostly<br />warm/cool up until the end of december","Bain Fulcher (45%): Considering that it is still<br />90 degrees in September, I doubt it. But, I am not<br />from Georgia, so I don't know the weather patterns<br />here very well.","samiha sarwar (35%): Georgia doesn't typically get<br />that cold until January.","Peyton Murry (15%): It is too hot.","Ansley Austin (30%): Athens is very hot and will<br />not reach freezing by December.","Harini Mohan (25%): Looking at the average lows<br />from previous years, it never really got that<br />cold. Its also getting hotter each year.","Harshini Mohan (30%): It has been getting hotter<br />each year so it probably won't get that cold<br />unless it's in the middle of the night."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.75,0.20000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.45000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.02,0.40000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.5,0.10000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.59999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.80000000000000004,0.69999999999999996,0.29999999999999999,0.80000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.25,0.5,0.90000000000000002,0.65000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.45000000000000001,0.5,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.25,0.69999999999999996,0.69999999999999996,0.25,0.80000000000000004,0.80000000000000004,0.20000000000000001,0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.84999999999999998,0.25,0.29999999999999999],"y":[4.0069170247996224,1.9884421710390598,0.97114329165779056,3.9789807429071518,1.9791789882350712,1.0046521779382602,3.9976065479684619,2.0403371135937052,1.0399249769281596,4.0155800728127362,2.0135066960705443,0.9992526658112183,4.0431230496847999,2.0020840999670328,1.0283876640489324,4.0166215552482756,2.0076352851232513,1.0478427540743724,3.956096085323952,2.0318275361554696,1.0000899622915314,4.0357492526061831,2.0047260330524295,0.97622689439449462,4.0194370999233797,2.0442477473523466,1.0365945177152753,4.0129477538401259,2.0040079996688291,0.99240505106281485,3.9716038004029541,2.0374505416490138,0.99427683874964712,4.015315598947927,1.9979969098931178,0.97747253896668551,4.0149946144549178,2.0082908338867127,1.027750467369333,4.0326484807766976,1.9525402272120118,1.0037112211575732,3.9665399398887531,2.024566576234065,0.97729720980860291,3.9795349681051446,2.0162169672315939,0.97036716735456141,3.9892766420729457,1.9854673154652118,1.0447864264016971],"text":["Jack Whipple (75%): We are looking great this year<br />and coming off a great two seasons, but it will<br />still be hard to go undefeated.","Jack Whipple (20%): I think she wants to hype it<br />up as much as she can before she drops it, so she<br />will wait as long as she can.","Jack Whipple (20%): I feel like there is a lot of<br />conflict that also has to do with politics, so I<br />do not see this ending soon.","Joe Ornstein (45%): The Dawgs have a very<br />favorable regular season schedule this year,<br />playing very few teams that present a serious<br />challenge. That said, every game there is<br />some chance of an upset, and those small<br />chances compound over 12 weeks. At the risk of<br />embarrassing myself twice in two years over the<br />same question...","Joe Ornstein (20%): Seems like it would be a bit<br />*too soon* on the heels of 1989 (TV) to announce<br />another re-release. Swiftologists analyzing the<br />Karma music video predict that Reputation (TV)<br />will be released during the solar eclipse on<br />April 8, 2024, and announced two months earlier<br />in February. But the question wording would also<br />be satisfied by a brand new studio album or a live<br />album, and Taylor Swift is *prolific*.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires are only negotiated<br />when *both* parties believe that peace is better<br />than what they could potentially achieve by<br />extending the conflict. And neither party believes<br />that right now. Putin thinks time is on his side:<br />Russian troops can hold their defensive line<br />until Western resolve and support dries up. And<br />the Ukrainian government is steadfastly opposed<br />to any negotiation that surrenders territory.<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/world/europe/ukraine-fight-negotiations.html","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): Georgia is coming off<br />back-to-back national championships and everyone<br />knows they are the team to beat. This means that<br />everyone will be gunning to beat them and circling<br />the uga game on their calendar as their chance<br />to shock the world. Our schedule is ridiculously<br />easy, and the out-of-conference games are a joke.<br />However, an SEC team, probably either Auburn,<br />Tennessee, or Florida will beat us in a game this<br />year. We will finish the regular season with one<br />loss","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): Taylor is dropping her<br />version of 1989 on October 27th, which means that<br />these songs will be the talk of teenage girls for<br />the next month. Her marketing is impressive and<br />her fanbase's dedication to her is even more so.<br />When this album drops, they will be satisfied for<br />at least a month and will not be clamoring for a<br />new one until at least a month later. Also, she<br />will not want to drop the albums close together<br />because they would drown each other out in the<br />press. Each one needs its own time.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): It appears as if the war<br />is headed to a stalemate, but not an official<br />one. Russia is dug into trenches and is not going<br />anywhere easily due to Putin's stubbornness.<br />However, Ukraine also doesn't have the manpower<br />to move them. I believe this will result in an<br />unofficial ceasefire that neither side officially<br />agrees to.","Victoria Harrill (90%): The past two years they<br />have shown to be undefeated.","Victoria Harrill (85%): Speak Now (TV) just came<br />out, and she spaces them out a couple to a few<br />months apart.","Victoria Harrill (75%): The Wagner Chief was<br />confirmed dead in a plane crash which will damage<br />Russia's military abilities in Ukraine.","Jacob Fortner (85%): Our schedule is pretty weak<br />this year with our only semi-difficult game being<br />Ole Miss which is at home. As Carson Beck gets<br />more experience, he'll get better thus making us<br />better which is why I gave us an 85% chance to go<br />undefeated in the regular season.","Jacob Fortner (50%): I don't know anything about<br />Taylor Swift so I'm giving it a coin flip as my<br />prediction.","Jacob Fortner (10%): I think the war will only<br />end if there is significant intervening from the<br />western hemisphere in favor of Ukraine, if this<br />does not happen (which I'm not confident in) then<br />I do not think the war will end by the end of the<br />semester.","Maggie Fertig (80%): They preformed very well<br />last year so the probability that they will be<br />undefeated again is high. However, there is a new<br />quarterback, so there is still some uncertainty<br />for how the team will perform.","Maggie Fertig (60%): Taylor Swift has been<br />releasing music at a rapid pace this year, already<br />with one new album and a couple re-recordings. I<br />think the odds of her announcing a new album is<br />high. But since she is working on re-recordings,<br />she may be too busy for new stuff.","Maggie Fertig (30%): The crisis has been ongoing<br />for a few months now. The odds that a ceasefire<br />will be reached before Nov 29 is low, especially<br />with tensions rising everyday. However, there is<br />still a slight possibility.","Duy Do (80%): Because we are the champion for 2<br />consecutive years","Duy Do (70%): Because she need a new album for the<br />next year.","Duy Do (30%): Because Ukraine still try to apply<br />to NATO","Kang Lee (80%): I believe that UGA has a very<br />solid chance of going undefeated again this<br />season with a low chance of being upturned by an<br />underdog.","Kang Lee (30%): I don't believe that there is a<br />significant enough event between now and Nov 29<br />for her to announce her final album. It'd be more<br />believable for her to announce her final album<br />after the hype around the eras tour dies down<br />and after 2023. I put the probability at 30 as<br />I believe that there may be a small chance that<br />she announces it but has it set for release much<br />further down the line.","Kang Lee (40%): I believe that Russia will pull<br />out of Ukraine before the end of the semester<br />but they will not announce their desire for a<br />ceasefire until 2024. I believe that while Putin<br />is in power a ceasefire will not be called and<br />a coup will take a while to fully take away the<br />authority of Putin.","Simryn Patel (90%): we are two time national<br />champions","Simryn Patel (85%): she is on a good track to<br />doing this, she has been releasing one very often","Simryn Patel (30%): it has been a very long war<br />and negotiations are not being created easily","Hita Boddu (85%): UGA Football was undefeated last<br />season.","Hita Boddu (25%): She has an album coming out<br />in late October, so it is highly unlikely she'll<br />release one soon.","Hita Boddu (50%): Political disputes are<br />unpredictable so it could go either way.","Rease Bauer (90%): I think this because our<br />schedule is pretty easy but i didn't put 100%<br />because there could be a game where our players<br />aren't playing at their best","Rease Bauer (65%): her next rerecorded album<br />comes out early october, so it is possible for<br />an announcement of the next rerecord but not the<br />actual release of it","Rease Bauer (40%): i know nothing about this and<br />haven't been keeping up with the war at all","Bain Fulcher (95%): We have a pretty easy schedule","Bain Fulcher (45%): 1989 TV will be released in<br />late October, so it is unlikely that she will<br />announce the next one that soon. But, it is Taylor<br />Swift, so maybe.","Bain Fulcher (50%): It is hard to say because it<br />has been going on for a while, which could mean it<br />will end soon, but maybe not.","samiha sarwar (75%): We have a very easy schedule.","samiha sarwar (85%): She has been very consistent<br />with her relases and gave an hint.","samiha sarwar (25%): They have been at war for<br />a while and I don't see the conflict resolving<br />anytime soon.","Peyton Murry (70%): Because UGA has already won<br />2 years in a row, it's unlikely for them to win<br />again. However, they've showed that they're still<br />a good team and have an easier schedule","Peyton Murry (70%): It would make sense, but<br />Taylor Swift is unpredictable. She also usually<br />announces album releases a little further apart","Peyton Murry (25%): Russia will not back down.<br />A ceasefire will only happen if other countries<br />intervene. I don't think that'll happen within our<br />semester","Ansley Austin (80%): I think Ole Miss, Florida,<br />or South Carolina will give them a 9-1 regular<br />reason.","Ansley Austin (80%): She recently announced 1989,<br />so Reputation is expected to be announced before<br />then December.","Ansley Austin (20%): I do not know much about<br />Russia vs Ukraine, but I don't think it'll stop<br />soon.","Harini Mohan (75%): Mainly because we were<br />national champions for 2x in a row. But in the<br />individual games, we might lose one.","Harini Mohan (30%): One month isn't really enough<br />time for her to release anything. Especially<br />because 1989 is coming in October.","Harini Mohan (20%): Since there hasn't been any<br />major news about it, I don't think something will<br />come up.","Harshini Mohan (85%): We have the same coach and<br />we were undefeated the last two years.","Harshini Mohan (25%): She just released a new<br />release date for one of her rerecordings so she<br />probably won't announce a new one.","Harshini Mohan (30%): Putin is still in power and<br />it probably won't end until he's

The Mega Millions is a very elusive<br />prize, that the odds of drawing it is very low.","Maggie Fertig (40%): While two tracks form her<br />previous album hit the No. 1 spot, I think the<br />chances are low that at least one song on this<br />album will hit No. 1 because right now on the<br />charts, vampire is going down and the other<br />highest spot is 39 and going down.","samiha sarwar (35%): While I know time isn't<br />the matter but someone recently won. I think the<br />chances of someone else winning is low.","samiha sarwar (95%): When her album comes out at<br />least one song has hot No. 1. She is a very good<br />artist with a large audience.","Joe Ornstein (63%): Two ways of thinking about<br />this one. On the one hand, if you look back at all<br />the Mega Millions jackpot winners over the past<br />five years, it is *very* rare to see a period of<br />77 days in which there's no winner. If you pick a<br />random 77-day period, there's about an 85% chance<br />that it will contain a jackpot winner. That said,<br />we just had a big >$1 billion jackpot, and ticket<br />sales tend to slum after those big wins, leading<br />to reduced odds of winning. There are about 11<br />million tickets being sold for each drawing,<br />22 drawings left, and 1 in 302 million odds of<br />winning the jackpot. Putting all that together,<br />you get roughly 55% chance of a ticket winning<br />the jackpot before Nov 29, but I'll bump that up<br />a bit since I expect tickets sales to increase the<br />larger the jackpot gets.","Joe Ornstein (80%): \"Will\" is, I think, the key<br />word here. The lead single \"Vampire\" already hit<br />No. 1 before the album released. Will it go back<br />to No 1? Will another track from the album hit No.<br />1? Three from her first record did, and Guts has<br />received a lot of critical acclaim, so I think the<br />odds are good.","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (50%): 50/50 chance<br />because the lottery is an unpredictable event","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (75%): With her first<br />album, \"Driver's License\" hit number one. She<br />has several fans, so it is a high possibility it<br />happens again with her new album by November.","Bain Fulcher (2%): The odds of winning a Mega<br />Millions jackpot is about 1 in 302.6 million. So,<br />it is very unlikely that someone will win between<br />now and November 29.","Bain Fulcher (85%): Her song \"Vampire\" from the<br />album is already number 9 on the list, so there<br />is a good chance that her songs will continue to<br />climb and that at least one will hit No.1.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (85%): It seems likely.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (20%): Her hit songs of this album<br />are not that good.","Hita Boddu (15%): Only 212 jackpots have been won<br />since the game began.","Hita Boddu (100%): Many of her songs from SOUR hit<br />No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100.","Harini Mohan (15%): No one had won a Mega Million<br />jackpot since April 18. It's played in 45 states<br />so the odds are pretty low for someone in Georgia<br />to win.","Harini Mohan (100%): Her new album \"Guts\" has<br />gotten popular on social media handles like<br />TikTok. One of her songs \"Vampire\" is already<br />standing at #9.","Harshini Mohan (40%): The odds of winning that is<br />low.","Harshini Mohan (85%): Her new album is getting<br />alot of attention and she might go on tour.","Rease Bauer (20%): Winning the lottery is rare so<br />a low probability makes the most sense","Rease Bauer (80%): I think a high probability<br />because her last album was a success and her two<br />songs she released as singles before everyone<br />liked","Peyton Murry (10%): It seems to only happen ab 6<br />times on avg per year and it’s already happened 8<br />times this year","Peyton Murry (30%): Needs more clout","Jacob Fortner (40%): These things never result in<br />a winner almost, and when they do it takes forever<br />so I think it happens later, if it happens.","Jacob Fortner (60%): Not a big fan of Olivia<br />Rodrigo but what seems to happen with these<br />up-and-coming artists is that they receive a great<br />deal of hype simply for them because younger. From<br />this I say it's more likely than not.","Ansley Austin (80%): 4 winners won the mega<br />million jackpot on Septermber 12, so there's<br />definitely a good probability.","Ansley Austin (80%): Vampire already has, so I<br />think a song like \"bad idea, right?\" will do the<br />same.","Kang Hyuk Lee (50%): I believe the chance of<br />someone winning the mega millions is a 50 50<br />chance.","Kang Hyuk Lee (20%): There's too many other<br />artists that are contending for top spot and I<br />don't believe Olivia's sophomore album will be<br />popular enough"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.90000000000000002,0.050000000000000003,0.14999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.25,0.40000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.40999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.45000000000000001,0.34999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.90000000000000002],"y":[2.9823417847044764,3.0113594386028124,2.9950804506195707,2.9583793111378327,3.0373283270979301,3.0430916408542545,3.015218229824677,2.9968810513382778,2.9890655816765501,2.997398591740057,2.9735226397868244,2.9683826329652221,2.9516762371407821,3.0145580445649101,3.0257774608908221,2.9613472930388527,2.9707314499886706],"text":["Jack Whipple (90%): 50% of the winners have been<br />male and %50 have been females, so it's really<br />50/50 but I believe that more women will remain<br />because 4 guys have won in a row, and it's only<br />at 2 females in a row so they more likely going to<br />either match or excede this streak.","Duy Do (5%): Because men are physically stronger<br />than women","Simryn Patel (15%): statistically more men have<br />become survivors","Maggie Fertig (40%): While women do perform well<br />on this show, in the past they have been voted off<br />first.

I know that several of my hall<br />mates, including myself, have encountered at<br />least one already, and we are on the 8th floor.<br />Also, the number of cockroaches seen is likely to<br />increase as temperatures drop.","samiha sarwar (100%): Judging by how many I have<br />seen so far, there's not a doubt in my mind that<br />we will hit 30 cockroach counter by November 29.<br />Its very humid inside of Creswell especially the<br />bathroom, and thats where they like to hide out.","Rease Bauer (100%): creswell is disgusting and the<br />roaches love it","Maggie Fertig (65%): The cockroach count was at<br />9 over an approximate 3 week time period. At this<br />rate, the cockroach count should reach 30 by the<br />beginning of Nov. However, I suspect the counters<br />will loose motivation and forget to record the<br />counts.","Simryn Patel (85%): they have already reached like<br />15","Jacob Fortner (75%): If I recall correctly, we<br />said there was already 15 seen by this point and<br />we are only a month into the semester. With still<br />a couple months before November 29th, I think it<br />is a high probability that 30 will be reached or<br />even surpassed.","Tori Harrill (95%): Encounters with residents of<br />Creswell have already seen several roaches. There<br />is a high probability there will be more sightings<br />before the end of the semester, so a count of 30<br />seems likely.","Jack Whipple (90%): Creswell is known for not<br />being clean and sanitary so I think this is very<br />likely.","Harini Mohan (85%): There has already been so many<br />cockroaches. Also, when the weather gets colder,<br />cockroaches find their way into cracks, screens,<br />pipes, etc.","Peyton Murry (60%): THERE ARE TOO MANY<br />COCKROACHES. Also, I apologize that I have<br />submitted all of my recent questions late. I've<br />had the issue of consistently forgetting that the<br />answers to the questions are due the day BEFORE<br />class, and not the day OF class. I will do better","Joe Ornstein (25%): To reach 30, the residents<br />of Creswell's 2nd floor would need to continue<br />reporting roach sightings over the next 10 weeks<br />at roughly the same rate as they did for the first<br />5 weeks. I expect it is more likely that the rate<br />will decrease as the weather cools and residents<br />become less diligent about reporting sightings on<br />the counter. There's a chance that someone will<br />manipulate the counter, sure, but I get good vibes<br />from Samiha and don't think it's likely.","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): The more people complain<br />about cockroaches, the more exterminators will be<br />on the floor, fighting them.","Harshini Mohan (75%): There has already been a lot<br />of cockroaches, and as it gets colder, there will<br />probably be more.","Ansley Austin (75%): At this rate, only a month<br />into school, it's very likely it will reach 30<br />especially with the cold months."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.69999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.55000000000000004,0.5,0.65000000000000002,0.25,0.84999999999999998,0.5,0.84999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.69999999999999996,0.40000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.75,0.55000000000000004,0.17999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,1,0.80000000000000004,0.84999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.10000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.40000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.55000000000000004,0.62,0.55000000000000004],"y":[1.9707748186076059,1.0272127419244499,1.9771339214639738,0.99882233003154397,1.9909566842019557,1.0230263703502716,1.9585997263668105,0.9706907556159422,2.0248726795893162,0.95789198209531601,1.967185082938522,0.98965612570755179,1.9965220654616131,1.0234398306813091,1.9708862013649195,0.96209173563402151,1.9505240097874776,1.0160883997799828,2.038685257942416,0.96339448578655718,2.0032178084598855,1.0385576415574178,2.0211228476138787,0.99303090369794522,2.0386708259116859,0.99350255613680927,1.9815950304269792,0.99218041829299186,2.0384244987042619,0.97116667344234886,2.025720114610158,1.0031439349986613,2.0271463003242389,1.0401436262996868],"text":["Duy Do (70%): He is leading now","Duy Do (90%): Lee storm is predicted to hit the<br />New England","Kang Hyuk Lee (90%): He's been very mainstream and<br />in public light a lot so I believe he has a solid<br />chance of leading the republican party again.","Kang Hyuk Lee (30%): As there was already a<br />category 4 hurricane (Ildalia) that hit the east<br />coast I doubt another one is going to hit this<br />side of the US and I also doubt that the west side<br />is going to get hit.","Hita Boddu (55%): Donald Trump is leading the<br />national polls by 55.5%.","Hita Boddu (50%): Hurricane season is from July<br />1st to November 30th.","bain Fulcher (65%): He is already pretty far ahead<br />of all of the other candidates, but it is hard<br />to say for sure because who knows what the future<br />holds for him and his campaign.","bain Fulcher (25%): Category IV or higher<br />hurricanes are uncommon, so it is unlikely that<br />one will make landfall on the mainland U.S. before<br />November 29. But, there will be more rain than<br />usual this year because it is an el Niño year, so<br />there is a greater chance than usual.","samiha sarwar (85%): He has still be very popular<br />amongst the republican party. He receives a lot<br />of support so I wouldn't be shocked if he lead the<br />party again.","samiha sarwar (50%): I can see this going either<br />way. We can get really bad hurricane, but I<br />haven't heard of any really bad ones recently. We<br />are in hurricane season, so I am really sure.","Rease Bauer (85%): After Biden, I think Trump<br />built up enough support behind him with the insane<br />contrast from Biden, that he or DeSantis will be<br />in the lead for the conservative party.","Rease Bauer (65%): I think this because in the<br />past almost every year we have had a bad hurricane<br />at least once.","Maggie Fertig (70%): Based on his popularity<br />amongst the republican party, it is likely he will<br />lead the race by Nov 29. According to the average<br />published by 538, his lead has increased steadily<br />since the beginning of this year (43 to 55%) while<br />his opponents have mostly decreased.","Maggie Fertig (40%): Only have been 27 documented<br />since 1850s. It is doubtful that one will occur<br />this year however not impossible, as there was a<br />category 4 in Sept of 2022.","Simryn Patel (60%): he has a grip on GOP voters","Simryn Patel (75%): global warming","Jacob Fortner (55%): Yes, Trump is very popular,<br />but Ron Desantis is on the come up. I think the<br />main problem people have with Trump is that he<br />isn't exactly the nicest individual, but he does<br />get things done but Desantis is seen by people<br />as a better individual. (I know nothing about<br />politics)","Jacob Fortner (18%): There have only been 32<br />category 4 or higher hurricanes in the last 173<br />years. Statistically, that creates an 18% change<br />per year.","Tori Harrill (85%): Trump is significantly ahead<br />of any other candidate. His percentage runs at<br />55.8% while other candidates are significantly<br />lower at statistics such as 14.6% (DeSantis), 7.8%<br />(Ramaswamy), 6.4% (Haley), 4.8% (Pence)","Tori Harrill (35%): Only four category 5<br />hurricanes have hit mainland US ever, so it is<br />a lower possibility this happens even during<br />hurricane season","Jack Whipple (100%): I feel that the majority of<br />the republican party is in favor of Trump as they<br />are upset that he was not able to be president<br />last election and want him to try again this time.","Jack Whipple (80%): There is almost alwasy a<br />hurrican that hits the U.S.","Harini Mohan (85%): Trump's highest average as<br />of now is 59%. That is far higher than the other<br />candidates. Also, as a previous president and<br />lots of experience, he seems to have a popular<br />advantage.","Harini Mohan (40%): If there were any major<br />hurricanes, they should have hit by now. As we get<br />closer to December, it is less likely for one to<br />hit.","Peyton Murry (45%): He was just in jail! I don't<br />think he's a good candidate; however, I didn't<br />think he was a good candidate in 2016, yet, here<br />we are","Peyton Murry (40%): I'm thinking it'll diminish to<br />a category 3 if it hits mainland","Joe Ornstein (95%): I mean, he's 77 years old so<br />mortality risk is non-zero, but aside from that<br />his lead is so dominant, and name recognition so<br />powerful compared to the other candidates, that<br />there's little chance of his lead slipping before<br />the first primary in January.","Joe Ornstein (10%): It's only happened twice in<br />the past 23 years (Ian in 2022 and Michael in<br />2018). That suggests a base rate of 8%, but I'll<br />bump it up to 10% to reflect the lengthening of<br />hurricane season during this period.","Ryan Wolkofsky (70%): The biggest challenger,<br />DeSantis is getting little to no press.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): These events are pretty<br />uncommon later in the year","Harshini Mohan (80%): He was the previous<br />president, and he has a large number of people who<br />want him to run again.","Harshini Mohan (55%): Hurricanes usually happen<br />during warmer/humid months.","Ansley Austin (62%): GOP primary voters should get<br />him many

I think we<br />have a chance of winning.","Kang Lee (70%): If the office of personnel<br />management states that there will be a shutdown on<br />Oct 2 I belive that it is likely.","Kang Lee (80%): The US has won a majority of the<br />Ryder Cups so I believe that they are likely to<br />win again.","Peyton Murry (100%): YAS- it's happened before it<br />can def happen again","Peyton Murry (100%): america on top","Rease Bauer (40%): they could but im not confident<br />they will","Rease Bauer (45%): I dont know what the ryder cup<br />is","Jacob Fortner (15%): Predicting a specific<br />day of a shutdown seems difficult; however, we<br />are projected to have one towards the end of<br />September. Whether that leads into October we will<br />have to see.","Jacob Fortner (65%): Fairly back and forth history<br />between the US and Europe but the US has won 2 of<br />the last 3 and our team is composed of some great<br />pairs who build momentum with each other.","Maggie Fertig (70%): As of now, Congress has one<br />week to finalize the budget. Since the Congress<br />and House is still divided, there is a good chance<br />it will be shut down. However, it is not ideal for<br />government workers so they will try and avoid a<br />shutdown if possible.","Maggie Fertig (60%): The US team is favored by a<br />large margin however haven't won on European soil<br />since 1993.

There is<br />a chance that this will occur because Congress<br />has not yet come to an agreement on passing<br />funding legislation. Many hardline Republicans<br />promised to block funding legislation unless deep<br />spending cuts are made. Unless Congress can reach<br />a compromise by September 30th, a government<br />shutdown will occur.","Bain Fulcher (75%): The US team are about -110<br />favorites while the Europeans are priced as +110<br />underdogs. But, something could happen and the<br />Europeans could win.","Harshini Mohan (65%): Congress has to come up with<br />an agreement to fund agencies, and that hasn't<br />happened yet.","Harshini Mohan (65%): When USA played Europe in<br />2021, we won by a lot so we have a good chance of<br />winning again, but the teams have changed a lot<br />since then.","Harini Mohan (65%): The deadline to fund the<br />government is September 30, so we would not know<br />for sure until then. I feel like we may need more<br />than 4 days.","Harini Mohan (30%): I think Europe will win<br />because they are hard to beat when they're at<br />home.

Is he willing to do this to avoid<br />a shutdown? It's a small chance, but a chance.<br />Most of the congressional Republican leadership<br />have lost their appetite for shutdowns. Prediction<br />markets currently price it at 75%.","Joe Ornstein (55%): The moneyline for a USA win<br />is -120 right now. Wager $120 to win $100, so<br />Vegas is giving USA approximately 55% chance.<br />Historically, US has won 9 out of 20, so this<br />suggests slightly better odds than usual.","Ansley Austin (70%): it seems as though most<br />people think there is no way to avoid it.","Ansley Austin (60%): Europe is favored, but they<br />could still win."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0,0.65000000000000002,0.98999999999999999,1,0.69999999999999996,0.69999999999999996,0.65000000000000002,1,1,1,0.45000000000000001,1],"y":[0.95919596992898737,1.0193123399745674,1.0029009340098127,0.96077651891391724,0.95681545885745434,0.99358992693014447,0.95792535776272414,0.98681167182512586,0.98582324925810094,0.98014586330391462,0.98961569266393778,1.0311304678209126,0.99262180416844781,0.97834868743084369,1.0074991848086938,0.96168994363397364],"text":["Tori Harrill (60%): There are rumors that they<br />are truly dating, but I don't know if Taylor Swift<br />will ever confirm it .","Simryn Patel (40%): I think he likes her but she<br />hasnt really made an effort to date him","samiha sarwar (95%): They have been spotted<br />together, and they would be a power couple.","Kang Lee (20%): I believe that her confirming that<br />she is dating Travis is a very random chance and<br />it seems like a very strange thing for a couple to<br />announce that they are officially dating even if<br />it is blatantly obvious but not confirmed.","Peyton Murry (0%): she doesn't ever really<br />publicly proclaim relationships","Rease Bauer (65%): She never fully confirms her<br />relationships unless they are long term and they<br />just started dating.","Jacob Fortner (99%): She was literally at the<br />Kansas City and Chicago game yesterday cheering<br />Travis on.","Maggie Fertig (100%): Pictures were just released<br />that prove they are dating, or at least talking.<br />Given this, I am very confident she will publicly<br />announce their relationship.","Hita Boddu (70%): They have already been very<br />public, also it will be good publicity for 1989<br />TV.","Ryan Wolkofsky (70%): It's all over social media","Bain Fulcher (65%): They have been seen together<br />and he rented out a restaurant for her and his<br />teammates.

This isn't dispositive, of course. He<br />did, after all, publicly invite her to the game<br />last week.

I don't think we will formally enter a<br />war though.","Ansley Austin (65%): Starting off with easier<br />games, then could go either way with the unranked<br />SEC teams.","Ansley Austin (60%): I honestly don't know the<br />extent of the US's involvement in the conflict<br />right now, but I think we may get more involved<br />in some way during our efforts to try to help<br />deescalate the situation.","samiha sarwar (30%): I've never heard anything<br />about UGA basketball","samiha sarwar (50%): I honestly have no idea. The<br />US does like getting involved in conflict, so I<br />could see it going any way.","Tori Harrill (65%): I don't know that much about<br />our basketball team here, but they made the rank<br />last year.","Tori Harrill (85%): The U.S has just sent several<br />more troops closer to Israel, and have sent out<br />deployment preparation orders to others to get<br />them ready.","Harshini Mohan (40%): Georgia hasn't won an NCAA<br />game since 2002 and they've made it to the NCAA<br />just 3 times after Herrick left in 2003.","Harshini Mohan (45%): Kirby, the National Security<br />Council spokesman, said there are no active<br />plans or intentions to send U.S. troops to join a<br />potential ground war in Israel and Gaza.","Harini Mohan (40%): UGA has never really been<br />ranked that high and there are better teams","Harini Mohan (50%): It depends on if Biden sends<br />troops to Israel. If he does it'll be more likely<br />for something to happen and we get drawn into<br />active conflict.","Bain Fulcher (35%): We're not even receiving<br />any votes according to the AP Poll, so I'm not<br />optimistic.","Bain Fulcher (45%): The US has been sending<br />support to Israel and I think there is a chance<br />that we will get involved if other countries do,<br />but I think there is a good chance that we will<br />not be in active conflict with a Palestinian<br />militant group.","Jacob Fortner (15%): They're not a traditional<br />powerhouse and they play in a tough conference.","Jacob Fortner (99%): This is literally what we do,<br />gotta clutch up fr fr","Joe Ornstein (5%): UGA basketball ended last<br />season with a NET ranking of 157 (out of 363),<br />based on a pretty disappointing 16-16 record. The<br />season before that it was at 152. Since the NET<br />ratings are pretty strongly correlated with the<br />AP poll, it would be pretty improbable to make<br />the top 25 in one season. Looking back at the past<br />six seasons of Men's Basketball rankings, Georgia<br />hasn't made it to the top 25 once.","Joe Ornstein (25%): As of writing, the US Navy has<br />deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern<br />Mediterranean, ostensibly to deter Hezbollah<br />and other regional actors from taking this<br />opportunity to attack Israel. But it's unclear<br />what exactly this threat amounts to. The US does<br />not have a mutual defense pact with Israel, and<br />would not be obligated to intervene if Hezbollah<br />were to escalate its attacks on Israel. The US<br />military would only become actively involved in<br />the conflict if its personnel were attacked (an<br />outcome that Hezbollah leadership will be keen to<br />avoid) or if Iran intervenes directly (unlikely).","Peyton Murry (40%): It seems as if they haven't<br />done particularly well the past few years.<br />Moreover, I looked at a few people on their<br />roster, and it doesn't seem like they're the best<br />players out there.","Peyton Murry (45%): This is such a loaded<br />question. While President Biden has condemned the<br />terrorist attacks against Israel, he's also stated<br />that it is not okay to take these attacks as an<br />opportunity to be Islamaphobic. This shows that<br />this is a delicate conflict, which makes it hard<br />for an outside force to just step in. Moreover,<br />Biden said that at this moment, he doesn't feel<br />the need for the US military to engage in the war,<br />because, \"Israel has one of the finest fighting<br />forces\" (60 Minutes interview). Along with this,<br />the US is currently sending war materials to<br />Israel, which stands in place of our troops.<br />However, the US is literally known for stepping<br />in when difficult conflicts like this arise, and<br />many are calling for America to do so. This puts<br />a large social pressure on America, but at this<br />point, I don't think they'll succumb to it. From<br />now until the end of November, I don't think<br />American troops will physically engage in the<br />conflict. BUT, President Biden is going to Israel<br />to show his support, and if something happens to<br />him or to anyone else of \"importance,\" I think the<br />US will engage in the conflict.","Jack

Second, I feel<br />like Joe Biden is more unpopular, because people<br />see him as a stagnant president that hasn't done<br />much since getting into office (this is not my<br />personal opinion). And, I think this opinion<br />stems from the bafflement of his oldness. I<br />mean, people call him \"Sleepy Joe.\" And, yes,<br />he is the oldest US president to get elected and<br />does seem to forget some things but CMONNN, the<br />man is literally running the United States of<br />America. I can't even function properly when I've<br />had less than 7 hours of sleep. Sorry, didn't<br />mean to get off on a tangent. I don't think his<br />approval ratings will rise 1) because of this ^<br />and 2) as the Israeli-Hamas conflict gets worse,<br />more Americans will want the US to get involved.<br />However, I don't think Biden will, unless there's<br />a large threat to American citizens.","Peyton Murry (65%): I should probably wait to<br />answer this until after the game tonight. However,<br />I read that the Rangers are more favorable right<br />now.","Jacob Fortner (42%): 42 cause 42 is in the prompt","Jacob Fortner (25%): Their hitting, compared to<br />the Diamondbacks, is not fantastic and they were<br />very fortunate in game 1 but now that it's tied<br />and they're going to Arizona, I think Arizona will<br />win.","Rease Bauer (30%): most everyone is ready for him<br />to go at this point","Rease Bauer (55%): I know nothing about baseball","Simryn Patel (45%): his approval rate has been<br />decreasing more so than increasing","Simryn Patel (70%): They are predicted to win but<br />the odds between them and the diamondbacks are<br />tight","Maggie Fertig (60%): 3/5 polls in October were<br />over 42% so it is likely that in November there<br />will be at least 1","Maggie Fertig (70%): They are tied right now, and<br />I think they will win.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): The US has a long history<br />of protecting, defending, and siding with Isreal.<br />Isreal's actions are unpopular with the US<br />public at this time. This is causing his rating<br />to decrease. I don't see that changing before<br />December.","Ryan Wolkofsky (57%): Vegas is still smarter than<br />me.","Duy Do (40%): He is good","Duy Do (60%): I think they are strong","samiha sarwar (35%): His approval rate is close<br />but I don't think it will top it.","samiha sarwar (35%): Their numbers looks good but<br />I don't have high hopes.","Jack Whipple (10%): I looked it up and it says<br />around 40%","Jack Whipple (100%): They are playing very well<br />and are also winning 2-1","Harini Mohan (51%): its at 40.1% right now so<br />there is a decent chance for it to get to 42","Harini Mohan (50%): i don't know a lot about<br />baseball but a source i found says \" As for the<br />World Series betting market, the Rangers currently<br />sit at -330 to win the title.

They were at<br />-142 after splitting the first two games in Texas.<br />Conversely, the Diamondbacks' title odds are at<br />+265\"","Harshini Mohan (65%): Currently its at 40.1 and<br />I think it will go higher because the previous<br />graphs show that his average is around 40-42.","Harshini Mohan (80%): An article said \"As for the<br />World Series betting market, the Rangers currently<br />sit at -330 to win the title. \"","Toru Harrill (45%): While his approval rate is<br />close to 42%, it has been in a decline rather than<br />an increase for the past few months.","Toru Harrill (70%): I don't really know, but I've<br />just seen they have done well so far.","Joe Ornstein (80%): If there are approximately 40<br />polls in November with an average sample size of<br />1,500 and Biden's \"true\" approval rating is about<br />40%, then sampling error alone means that at least<br />one is pretty much guaranteed to show Biden with<br />an approval rating over 42% by the end of the<br />month. If his approval rating trends down in the<br />next few weeks, then you would need more than just<br />sampling error, but there's plenty of non-random<br />polling error. There were 7 polls in October that<br />showed him with an approval rating greater than<br />42%.","Joe Ornstein (88%): Coming back from a 3-1 deficit<br />is difficult, but not impossible. If each team<br />has roughly even odds of winning each game (as<br />the Vegas odds suggest), then the probability of<br />Arizona winning three in a row is 50% x 50% x 50%,<br />or roughly 12%.","Bain Fulcher (75%): right now he is very unpopular<br />because of his support of Israel. but, his<br />approval rate will probably increase, especially<br />if he is the only Democratic candidate and if his<br />recent legislation passed has a positive impact","Bain Fulcher (90%): they sit at -1450 to win the<br />title","Hita Boddu (80%): The approval rate is pretty<br />close to 42%.","Hita Boddu (70%): They are at -1300.","Ansley Austin (40%): He hasn't reached 42 since<br />April, but one poll could happen.","Ansley Austin (70%): They are currently favored<br />-1300 after game 4."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.40000000000000002,0.5,0.75,0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.5,0.10000000000000001,0.5,0.90000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.75,0.45000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.20000000000000001],"y":[3.0105522230034696,3.0300897266250102,3.0121412267675622,3.0412952956976369,3.0046589420875534,3.0069834301248193,2.9557961350539701,3.0229815466096626,3.0292819496709855,2.9766414443496614,2.9614379091653973,2.9570587491383775,3.0313443168299274,3.0328861688962205,2.950906841713004,3.048981019575149],"text":["Peyton Murry (40%): I feel in my heart that it<br />won't happen","Jacob Fortner (50%): I am not very knowledgeable<br />about this topic but apparently the House is back<br />so maybe that will help prevent the shutdown, idk","Rease Bauer (75%): I think they will because of<br />all the deadlock on issues","Simryn Patel (75%): they dont have a lot of time<br />for congress to enact a new spending package or<br />approve another stopgap","Maggie Fertig (30%): Last time we predicted a shut<br />down, I was wrong.

I think there is a good chance<br />he wins it just might be from a smaller statistic<br />of voters.","Maggie Fertig (70%): Based on the number of<br />students in the class, there is a high probability<br />at least one of them will beat Professor Ornstein.","Maggie Fertig (70%): He was in the bottom two<br />last week but was saved by fan votes. Given his<br />performance, I don't think he will last the next 3<br />eliminations.","Maggie Fertig (40%): He has made a huge comeback,<br />forcing the runoff to take place in a couple<br />weeks. However, when the time comes I think Milei<br />supporters will turn out.","Jack Whipple (100%): There are a lot of students<br />vs. 1 Professor Ornstein so someone is bound to<br />win.","Jack Whipple (10%): I believe based on what I<br />looked up that Jowsey will stay in after Nov 29th","Jack Whipple (10%): Based on what I researched,<br />Massa is not likely to win","Kang Lee (90%): A lot of students and some of them<br />have proven to be very accurate.","Kang Lee (60%): I believe he is slightly more<br />likely to be eliminated than not.","Kang Lee (70%): I believe he is in favor more than<br />Javier Millei","Peyton Murry (90%): You didn't win last year,<br />aren't first this year, and the ratio of students<br />to teacher is considerably large in regard to<br />this. Odds are on our side.","Peyton Murry (60%): Apparently, he's not doing<br />too hot and his last dance didn't score too well.<br />https://www.goldderby.com/article/2023/dancing-with-the-stars-elimination-odds-music-video-night/<br />and<br />https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/who-got-eliminated-during-dancing-with-the-stars-music-video-night/","Peyton Murry (51%): Javier Milei didn't win the<br />first round, but it should be a close race","Ryan Wolkofsky (80%): I'm beating you rn.","Ryan Wolkofsky (60%): He's a bad dancer.","Ryan Wolkofsky (70%): I like his policy.","Duy Do (30%): We have more than 10 students","Duy Do (40%): My guest","Duy Do (40%): I think so","Joe Ornstein (13%): I've crunched the numbers on<br />this one. In 5,000 simulated futures (based on<br />my current assessment of the probabilities), I<br />win the competition in about 4400. Things have to<br />break bad for me on multiple dimensions in order<br />to lose (e.g. peace in Ukraine + the US goes into<br />a recession + a category IV hurricane). It could<br />happen! Samiha wins about 5% of the time, Harshini<br />3%, Ansley 2%, and Ryan 1.5%.","Joe Ornstein (70%): Outside View: There are 7<br />teams and 3 eliminations before the end of the<br />semester, so even if they all had an even chance<br />of elimination, it'd be about 43%. Inside View:<br />It's *insane* that he hasn't been eliminated<br />yet. He's had the lowest weekly score in 4 out<br />of 7 weeks. There are four other consistently<br />high-scoring teams that are likely to make it to<br />the finals, and he's not one of them (95%).","Joe Ornstein (50%): Argentinian political polls<br />are not particularly reliable (the first round<br />results were a big surprise), so I don't put a<br />lot of stock in them. Nonetheless, they show the<br />race tightening, with no clear front-runner in the<br />runoff. It all depends on how Bullrich's voters<br />break.
