Swiftologists analyzing the<br />Karma music video predict that Reputation (TV)<br />will be released during the solar eclipse on<br />April 8, 2024, and announced two months earlier<br />in February. But the question wording would also<br />be satisfied by a brand new studio album or a live<br />album, and Taylor Swift is *prolific*.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires are only negotiated<br />when *both* parties believe that peace is better<br />than what they could potentially achieve by<br />extending the conflict. And neither party believes<br />that right now. Putin thinks time is on his side:<br />Russian troops can hold their defensive line<br />until Western resolve and support dries up. And<br />the Ukrainian government is steadfastly opposed<br />to any negotiation that surrenders territory.<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/world/europe/ukraine-fight-negotiations.html","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): Taylor is dropping her<br />version of 1989 on October 27th, which means that<br />these songs will be the talk of teenage girls for<br />the next month. Her marketing is impressive and<br />her fanbase's dedication to her is even more so.<br />When this album drops, they will be satisfied for<br />at least a month and will not be clamoring for a<br />new one until at least a month later. Also, she<br />will not want to drop the albums close together<br />because they would drown each other out in the<br />press. Each one needs its own time.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): It appears as if the war<br />is headed to a stalemate, but not an official<br />one. Russia is dug into trenches and is not going<br />anywhere easily due to Putin's stubbornness.<br />However, Ukraine also doesn't have the manpower<br />to move them. I believe this will result in an<br />unofficial ceasefire that neither side officially<br />agrees to.","Victoria Harrill (85%): Speak Now (TV) just came<br />out, and she spaces them out a couple to a few<br />months apart.","Victoria Harrill (75%): The Wagner Chief was<br />confirmed dead in a plane crash which will damage<br />Russia's military abilities in Ukraine.","Jacob Fortner (50%): I don't know anything about<br />Taylor Swift so I'm giving it a coin flip as my<br />prediction.","Jacob Fortner (10%): I think the war will only<br />end if there is significant intervening from the<br />western hemisphere in favor of Ukraine, if this<br />does not happen (which I'm not confident in) then<br />I do not think the war will end by the end of the<br />semester.","Maggie Fertig (60%): Taylor Swift has been<br />releasing music at a rapid pace this year, already<br />with one new album and a couple re-recordings. I<br />think the odds of her announcing a new album is<br />high. But since she is working on re-recordings,<br />she may be too busy for new stuff.","Maggie Fertig (30%): The crisis has been ongoing<br />for a few months now. The odds that a ceasefire<br />will be reached before Nov 29 is low, especially<br />with tensions rising everyday. However, there is<br />still a slight possibility.","Duy Do (70%): Because she need a new album for the<br />next year.","Duy Do (30%): Because Ukraine still try to apply<br />to NATO","Kang Lee (30%): I don't believe that there is a<br />significant enough event between now and Nov 29<br />for her to announce her final album. It'd be more<br />believable for her to announce her final album<br />after the hype around the eras tour dies down<br />and after 2023. I put the probability at 30 as<br />I believe that there may be a small chance that<br />she announces it but has it set for release much<br />further down the line.","Kang Lee (40%): I believe that Russia will pull<br />out of Ukraine before the end of the semester<br />but they will not announce their desire for a<br />ceasefire until 2024. I believe that while Putin<br />is in power a ceasefire will not be called and<br />a coup will take a while to fully take away the<br />authority of Putin.","Simryn Patel (85%): she is on a good track to<br />doing this, she has been releasing one very often","Simryn Patel (30%): it has been a very long war<br />and negotiations are not being created easily","Hita Boddu (25%): She has an album coming out<br />in late October, so it is highly unlikely she'll<br />release one soon.","Hita Boddu (50%): Political disputes are<br />unpredictable so it could go either way.","Rease Bauer (65%): her next rerecorded album<br />comes out early october, so it is possible for<br />an announcement of the next rerecord but not the<br />actual release of it","Rease Bauer (40%): i know nothing about this and<br />haven't been keeping up with the war at all","Bain Fulcher (45%): 1989 TV will be released in<br />late October, so it is unlikely that she will<br />announce the next one that soon. But, it is Taylor<br />Swift, so maybe.","Bain Fulcher (50%): It is hard to say because it<br />has been going on for a while, which could mean it<br />will end soon, but maybe not.","samiha sarwar (85%): She has been very consistent<br />with her relases and gave an hint.","samiha sarwar (25%): They have been at war for<br />a while and I don't see the conflict resolving<br />anytime soon.","Peyton Murry (70%): It would make sense, but<br />Taylor Swift is unpredictable. She also usually<br />announces album releases a little further apart","Peyton Murry (25%): Russia will not back down.<br />A ceasefire will only happen if other countries<br />intervene. I don't think that'll happen within our<br />semester","Ansley Austin (80%): She recently announced 1989,<br />so Reputation is expected to be announced before<br />then December.","Ansley Austin (20%): I do not know much about<br />Russia vs Ukraine, but I don't think it'll stop<br />soon.","Harini Mohan (30%): One month isn't really enough<br />time for her to release anything. Especially<br />because 1989 is coming in October.","Harini Mohan (20%): Since there hasn't been any<br />major news about it, I don't think something will<br />come up.","Harshini Mohan (25%): She just released a new<br />release date for one of her rerecordings so she<br />probably won't announce a new one.","Harshini Mohan (30%): Putin is still in power and<br />it probably won't end until he's out."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.45000000000000001,0.90000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.90000000000000002,0.34999999999999998,0.84999999999999998,0.25,0.80000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.80000000000000004,0.050000000000000003,0.80000000000000004,0.10000000000000001,0.90000000000000002,0.14999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.25,0.90000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.94999999999999996,0.45000000000000001,0.75,0.34999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.14999999999999999,0.80000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.75,0.25,0.84999999999999998,0.29999999999999999],"y":[4.0328674063552175,3.0290057725738735,3.9677077808184551,2.9991239304887132,4.0059813566273075,2.9642856981605292,3.9978911251295357,2.9817173314513639,4.0222794284811245,2.9708375314716249,3.9921395897865297,2.9728522440651433,4.0090904633980244,3.0217020104639234,4.0080431890208272,2.961212860024534,3.9772963631432505,3.0239933058386668,4.0082492526853457,2.9928068106528372,4.0067514689639214,3.024850171757862,3.9701687040273099,2.9749415761791171,3.9898741107201205,2.9662811292568221,3.9532183347502725,2.9982455665245653,4.045995477773249,2.9648355653509499,3.9711238163523377,2.9888702884316443,4.0461778772296384,3.0452908879145979],"text":["Jack Whipple (75%): We are looking great this year<br />and coming off a great two seasons, but it will<br />still be hard to go undefeated.","Jack Whipple (30%): It has been so hot recently<br />and does not get extremely cold until Jan. or Feb.<br />so I just don't see it happening.","Joe Ornstein (45%): The Dawgs have a very<br />favorable regular season schedule this year,<br />playing very few teams that present a serious<br />challenge. That said, every game there is<br />some chance of an upset, and those small<br />chances compound over 12 weeks. At the risk of<br />embarrassing myself twice in two years over the<br />same question...","Joe Ornstein (90%): In the past 20 years<br />of weather data, it's happened every year<br />except 2009 and 2020.

This one will be a real nail-biter.<br />https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ga/athens/KAHN","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): Georgia is coming off<br />back-to-back national championships and everyone<br />knows they are the team to beat. This means that<br />everyone will be gunning to beat them and circling<br />the uga game on their calendar as their chance<br />to shock the world. Our schedule is ridiculously<br />easy, and the out-of-conference games are a joke.<br />However, an SEC team, probably either Auburn,<br />Tennessee, or Florida will beat us in a game this<br />year. We will finish the regular season with one<br />loss","Ryan Wolkofsky (20%): Looking at last year's<br />weather, the temperature in Athens dropped below<br />32F a decent amount of times. However, none of<br />those came before November 29th. With the planet<br />warming each year, I do not see the temperature<br />getting lower this year than last year. Also, I<br />live in Charlotte, NC, and am familiar with the<br />climate of this region, The temperature tends to<br />get cold around the 2nd or 3rd week of December<br />but can stay in the 50s through New Year's Day.","Victoria Harrill (90%): The past two years they<br />have shown to be undefeated.","Victoria Harrill (35%): It is not common for<br />Georgia to get below freezing before December.","Jacob Fortner (85%): Our schedule is pretty weak<br />this year with our only semi-difficult game being<br />Ole Miss which is at home. As Carson Beck gets<br />more experience, he'll get better thus making us<br />better which is why I gave us an 85% chance to go<br />undefeated in the regular season.","Jacob Fortner (25%): From how hot it has been the<br />past few years during wintertime and from the heat<br />of this year so far, I am not confident that there<br />will be a point in time before the end of the<br />semester where the temperature in Athens, GA with<br />drop below freezing.","Maggie Fertig (80%): They preformed very well<br />last year so the probability that they will be<br />undefeated again is high. However, there is a new<br />quarterback, so there is still some uncertainty<br />for how the team will perform.","Maggie Fertig (30%): It is very rare that it gets<br />this cold in Athens in November, especially with<br />global warming. However it is possible to get cold<br />at night towards end of November month.","Duy Do (80%): Because we are the champion for 2<br />consecutive years","Duy Do (5%): Because the temperature has not been<br />dropped below 32F for many years","Kang Lee (80%): I believe that UGA has a very<br />solid chance of going undefeated again this<br />season with a low chance of being upturned by an<br />underdog.","Kang Lee (10%): As we live in GA based on past<br />weather patterns and current forecasts for the<br />future it s very unlikely that the temperature<br />will drop below freezing unless a flash cold front<br />were to appear out of the blue.","Simryn Patel (90%): we are two time national<br />champions","Simryn Patel (15%): It has been very hot this year<br />and later years have not gotten that cold at all","Hita Boddu (85%): UGA Football was undefeated last<br />season.","Hita Boddu (25%): It usually doesn't get that cold<br />until December / January.","Rease Bauer (90%): I think this because our<br />schedule is pretty easy but i didn't put 100%<br />because there could be a game where our players<br />aren't playing at their best","Rease Bauer (20%): I know nothing about athens<br />weather but from what i have heard it stays mostly<br />warm/cool up until the end of december","Bain Fulcher (95%): We have a pretty easy schedule","Bain Fulcher (45%): Considering that it is still<br />90 degrees in September, I doubt it. But, I am not<br />from Georgia, so I don't know the weather patterns<br />here very well.","samiha sarwar (75%): We have a very easy schedule.","samiha sarwar (35%): Georgia doesn't typically get<br />that cold until January.","Peyton Murry (70%): Because UGA has already won<br />2 years in a row, it's unlikely for them to win<br />again. However, they've showed that they're still<br />a good team and have an easier schedule","Peyton Murry (15%): It is too hot.","Ansley Austin (80%): I think Ole Miss, Florida,<br />or South Carolina will give them a 9-1 regular<br />reason.","Ansley Austin (30%): Athens is very hot and will<br />not reach freezing by December.","Harini Mohan (75%): Mainly because we were<br />national champions for 2x in a row. But in the<br />individual games, we might lose one.","Harini Mohan (25%): Looking at the average lows<br />from previous years, it never really got that<br />cold. Its also getting hotter each year.","Harshini Mohan (85%): We have the same coach and<br />we were undefeated the last two years.","Harshini Mohan (30%): It has been getting hotter<br />each year so

The Mega Millions is a very elusive<br />prize, that the odds of drawing it is very low.","Maggie Fertig (40%): While two tracks form her<br />previous album hit the No. 1 spot, I think the<br />chances are low that at least one song on this<br />album will hit No. 1 because right now on the<br />charts, vampire is going down and the other<br />highest spot is 39 and going down.","samiha sarwar (35%): While I know time isn't<br />the matter but someone recently won. I think the<br />chances of someone else winning is low.","samiha sarwar (95%): When her album comes out at<br />least one song has hot No. 1. She is a very good<br />artist with a large audience.","Joe Ornstein (63%): Two ways of thinking about<br />this one. On the one hand, if you look back at all<br />the Mega Millions jackpot winners over the past<br />five years, it is *very* rare to see a period of<br />77 days in which there's no winner. If you pick a<br />random 77-day period, there's about an 85% chance<br />that it will contain a jackpot winner. That said,<br />we just had a big >$1 billion jackpot, and ticket<br />sales tend to slum after those big wins, leading<br />to reduced odds of winning. There are about 11<br />million tickets being sold for each drawing,<br />22 drawings left, and 1 in 302 million odds of<br />winning the jackpot. Putting all that together,<br />you get roughly 55% chance of a ticket winning<br />the jackpot before Nov 29, but I'll bump that up<br />a bit since I expect tickets sales to increase the<br />larger the jackpot gets.","Joe Ornstein (80%): \"Will\" is, I think, the key<br />word here. The lead single \"Vampire\" already hit<br />No. 1 before the album released. Will it go back<br />to No 1? Will another track from the album hit No.<br />1? Three from her first record did, and Guts has<br />received a lot of critical acclaim, so I think the<br />odds are good.","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (50%): 50/50 chance<br />because the lottery is an unpredictable event","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (75%): With her first<br />album, \"Driver's License\" hit number one. She<br />has several fans, so it is a high possibility it<br />happens again with her new album by November.","Bain Fulcher (2%): The odds of winning a Mega<br />Millions jackpot is about 1 in 302.6 million.

It's played in 45 states<br />so the odds are pretty low for someone in Georgia<br />to win.","Harini Mohan (100%): Her new album \"Guts\" has<br />gotten popular on social media handles like<br />TikTok.

I know that several of my hall<br />mates, including myself, have encountered at<br />least one already, and we are on the 8th floor.<br />Also, the number of cockroaches seen is likely to<br />increase as temperatures drop.","samiha sarwar (85%): He has still be very popular<br />amongst the republican party. He receives a lot<br />of support so I wouldn't be shocked if he lead the<br />party again.","samiha sarwar (100%): Judging by how many I have<br />seen so far, there's not a doubt in my mind that<br />we will hit 30 cockroach counter by November 29.<br />Its very humid inside of Creswell especially the<br />bathroom, and thats where they like to hide out.","Rease Bauer (85%): After Biden, I think Trump<br />built up enough support behind him with the insane<br />contrast from Biden, that he or DeSantis will be<br />in the lead for the conservative party.","Rease Bauer (100%): creswell is disgusting and the<br />roaches love it","Maggie Fertig (70%): Based on his popularity<br />amongst the republican party, it is likely he will<br />lead the race by Nov 29. According to the average<br />published by 538, his lead has increased steadily<br />since the beginning of this year (43 to 55%) while<br />his opponents have mostly decreased.","Maggie Fertig (65%): The cockroach count was at<br />9 over an approximate 3 week time period. At this<br />rate, the cockroach count should reach 30 by the<br />beginning of Nov. However, I suspect the counters<br />will loose motivation and forget to record the<br />counts.","Simryn Patel (60%): he has a grip on GOP voters","Simryn Patel (85%): they have already reached like<br />15","Jacob Fortner (55%): Yes, Trump is very popular,<br />but Ron Desantis is on the come up. I think the<br />main problem people have with Trump is that he<br />isn't exactly the nicest individual, but he does<br />get things done but Desantis is seen by people<br />as a better individual. (I know nothing about<br />politics)","Jacob Fortner (75%): If I recall correctly, we<br />said there was already 15 seen by this point and<br />we are only a month into the semester. With still<br />a couple months before November 29th, I think it<br />is a high probability that 30 will be reached or<br />even surpassed.","Tori Harrill (85%): Trump is significantly ahead<br />of any other candidate. His percentage runs at<br />55.8% while other candidates are significantly<br />lower at statistics such as 14.6% (DeSantis), 7.8%<br />(Ramaswamy), 6.4% (Haley), 4.8% (Pence)","Tori Harrill (95%): Encounters with residents of<br />Creswell have already seen several roaches. There<br />is a high probability there will be more sightings<br />before the end of the semester, so a count of 30<br />seems likely.","Jack Whipple (100%): I feel that the majority of<br />the republican party is in favor of Trump as they<br />are upset that he was not able to be president<br />last election and want him to try again this time.","Jack Whipple (90%): Creswell is known for not<br />being clean and sanitary so I think this is very<br />likely.","Harini Mohan (85%): Trump's highest average as<br />of now is 59%. That is far higher than the other<br />candidates. Also, as a previous president and<br />lots of experience, he seems to have a popular<br />advantage.","Harini Mohan (85%): There has already been so many<br />cockroaches. Also, when the weather gets colder,<br />cockroaches find their way into cracks, screens,<br />pipes, etc.","Peyton Murry (45%): He was just in jail! I don't<br />think he's a good candidate; however, I didn't<br />think he was a good candidate in 2016, yet, here<br />we are","Peyton Murry (60%): THERE ARE TOO MANY<br />COCKROACHES. Also, I apologize that I have<br />submitted all of my recent questions late. I've<br />had the issue of consistently forgetting that the<br />answers to the questions are due the day BEFORE<br />class, and not the day OF class. I will do better","Joe Ornstein (95%): I mean, he's 77 years old so<br />mortality risk is non-zero, but aside from that<br />his lead is so dominant, and name recognition so<br />powerful compared to the other candidates, that<br />there's little chance of his lead slipping before<br />the first primary in January.","Joe Ornstein (25%): To reach 30, the residents<br />of Creswell's 2nd floor would need to continue<br />reporting roach sightings over the next 10 weeks<br />at roughly the same rate as they did for the first<br />5 weeks. I expect it is more likely that the rate<br />will decrease as the weather cools and residents<br />become less diligent about reporting sightings on<br />the counter. There's a chance that someone will<br />manipulate the counter, sure, but I get good vibes<br />from Samiha and don't think it's likely.","Ryan Wolkofsky (70%): The biggest challenger,<br />DeSantis is getting little to no press.","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): The more people complain<br />about cockroaches, the more exterminators will be<br />on the floor, fighting them.","Harshini Mohan (80%): He was the previous<br />president, and he has a large number of people who<br />want him to run again.","Harshini Mohan (75%): There has already been a lot<br />of cockroaches, and as it gets colder, there will<br />probably be more.","Ansley Austin (62%): GOP primary voters should get<br />him many votes.","Ansley Austin (75%): At this rate, only a month<br />into school, it's very likely it will reach 30<br />especially with the cold months."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.46999999999999997],"y":[0.96775976328644897],"text":"Class

Money<br />is a very hard problem to deal with so I think<br />they won't be able to do in time.","samiha sarwar (65%): Looking at the past winning<br />I see that we are pretty good at golf. I think we<br />have a chance of winning.","Kang Lee (70%): If the office of personnel<br />management states that there will be a shutdown on<br />Oct 2 I belive that it is likely.","Kang Lee (80%): The US has won a majority of the<br />Ryder Cups so I believe that they are likely to<br />win again.","Peyton Murry (100%): YAS- it's happened before it<br />can def happen again","Peyton Murry (100%): america on top","Rease Bauer (40%): they could but im not confident<br />they will","Rease Bauer (45%): I dont know what the ryder cup<br />is","Jacob Fortner (15%): Predicting a specific<br />day of a shutdown seems difficult; however, we<br />are projected to have one towards the end of<br />September. Whether that leads into October we will<br />have to see.","Jacob Fortner (65%): Fairly back and forth history<br />between the US and Europe but the US has won 2 of<br />the last 3 and our team is composed of some great<br />pairs who build momentum with each other.","Maggie Fertig (70%): As of now, Congress has one<br />week to finalize the budget. Since the Congress<br />and House is still divided, there is a good chance<br />it will be shut down. However, it is not ideal for<br />government workers so they will try and avoid a<br />shutdown if possible.","Maggie Fertig (60%): The US team is favored by a<br />large margin however haven't won on European soil<br />since 1993. I think they will win by a slight<br />chance because there is still some doubt.","Hita Boddu (50%): If the funds run out, there will<br />be a shutdown.","Hita Boddu (65%): The current 3-way market odds<br />show Team USA down to a -110 favorite.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): It doesn't seem likely","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): Europe wins more often.","Bain Fulcher (70%): Many believe that a government<br />shutdown will occur on October 1st. There is<br />a chance that this will occur because Congress<br />has not yet come to an agreement on passing<br />funding legislation. Many hardline Republicans<br />promised to block funding legislation unless deep<br />spending cuts are made. Unless Congress can reach<br />a compromise by September 30th, a government<br />shutdown will occur.","Bain Fulcher (75%): The US team are about -110<br />favorites while the Europeans are priced as +110<br />underdogs. But, something could happen and the<br />Europeans could win.","Harshini Mohan (65%): Congress has to come up with<br />an agreement to fund agencies, and that hasn't<br />happened yet.","Harshini Mohan (65%): When USA played Europe in<br />2021, we won by a lot so we have a good chance of<br />winning again, but the teams have changed a lot<br />since then.","Harini Mohan (65%): The deadline to fund the<br />government is September 30, so we would not know<br />for sure until then. I feel like we may need more<br />than 4 days.","Harini Mohan (30%): I think Europe will win<br />because they are hard to beat when they're at<br />home. They also have strong putters.","Jack Whipple (20%): I think that there wont be any<br />major issues that result in this.","Jack Whipple (90%): I have high hopes becuase the<br />team looks good this year.","Joe Ornstein (80%): At this point, the only chance<br />of averting a shutdown is for McCarthy to take<br />up the Senate's stopgap measure with Democratic<br />votes, which means he would likely lose the<br />Speaker's gavel. Is he willing to do this to avoid<br />a shutdown? It's a small chance, but a chance.<br />Most of the congressional Republican leadership<br />have lost their appetite for shutdowns. Prediction<br />markets currently price it at 75%.","Joe Ornstein (55%): The moneyline for a USA win<br />is -120 right now. Wager $120 to win $100, so<br />Vegas is giving USA approximately 55% chance.<br />Historically, US has won 9 out of 20, so this<br />suggests slightly better odds than usual.","Ansley Austin (70%): it seems as though most<br />people think there is no way to avoid it.","Ansley Austin (60%): Europe is favored, but they<br />could still win."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0,0.65000000000000002,0.98999999999999999,1,0.69999999999999996,0.69999999999999996,0.65000000000000002,1,1,1,0.45000000000000001,1],"y":[1.0354199619265274,0.98407269732560965,1.019553232868202,1.0147736195474863,1.0226718634134158,1.0392881003208458,1.0126215547323227,0.97738259085454049,1.0187603506259619,0.99187963125295942,0.96488237499725071,1.0435005998006091,0.96158488411456344,0.98740433647762982,0.9877130256965756,1.0016682993387804],"text":["Tori Harrill (60%): There are rumors that they<br />are truly dating, but I don't know if Taylor Swift<br />will ever confirm it .","Simryn Patel (40%): I think he likes her but she<br />hasnt really made an effort to date him","samiha sarwar (95%): They have been spotted<br />together, and they would be a power couple.","Kang Lee (20%): I believe that her confirming that<br />she is dating Travis is a very random chance and<br />it seems like a very strange thing for a couple to<br />announce that they are officially dating even if<br />it is blatantly obvious but not confirmed.","Peyton Murry (0%): she doesn't ever really<br />publicly proclaim relationships","Rease Bauer (65%): She never fully confirms her<br />relationships unless they are long term and they<br />just started dating.","Jacob Fortner (99%): She was literally at the<br />Kansas City and Chicago game yesterday cheering<br />Travis on.","Maggie Fertig (100%): Pictures were just released<br />that prove they are dating, or at least talking.<br />Given this, I am very confident she will publicly<br />announce their relationship.","Hita Boddu (70%): They have already been very<br />public, also it will be good publicity for 1989<br />TV.","Ryan Wolkofsky (70%): It's all over social media","Bain Fulcher (65%): They have been seen together<br />and he rented out a restaurant for her and his<br />teammates.

This isn't dispositive, of course. He<br />did, after all, publicly invite her to the game<br />last week. And even if they are dating, it's not<br />certain that she would publicly confirm it within<br />the next two months.

Biden wants to win another term so he<br />will prioritze econmic success in the coming<br />months.","Jacob Fortner (35%): Braves are having a historic<br />season with Acuná, Olson, and their pitchers.<br />Hopefully this carries over into the postseason","Jacob Fortner (70%): They delayed the shutdown<br />for 45 days so if I took this correctly, within<br />45 days, we will experience a shutdown unless<br />something changes","Maggie Fertig (70%): They are the top team right<br />now so the probability is high. However, some<br />other team could make a comeback.","Maggie Fertig (30%): A recession is expected<br />towards the start of the new year, but to have it<br />strat before the end of November is unlikely.","Ansley Austin (25%): Pitching has not been great<br />lately, but there still is a chance they could<br />pull it off.","Ansley Austin (20%): Since we have gone this far<br />into the year without a recession, I think the<br />economy is more durable than expected and we won't<br />have one before December.","Rease Bauer (70%): I dont watch baseball","Rease Bauer (65%): Bidens economics suck.","Harini Mohan (85%): The Atlanta Braves have had<br />the best records in baseball thanks to one of<br />their players Ronald Acuna. They also just have<br />the highest chance overall to win (24.39%).","Harini Mohan (40%): The US economy is still<br />growing so I don't really think it will go into a<br />recession. If anything it'll prob be until 2024 or<br />later than Nov. 29 for that to happen.","Harshini Mohan (65%): The braves had the best<br />regular season record so they have a good chance<br />of winning.","Harshini Mohan (40%): The economy is growing at a<br />modest pace, and consumer spending is helping the<br />economy maintain positive growth.","Bain Fulcher (70%): They are the \"team to beat\",<br />and they have a very strong team this year. But,<br />they just lost to the Nationals, and some of their<br />players are out due to injuries.","Bain Fulcher (50%): It is hard to say for sure<br />one way or the other. We are definitely heading to<br />the trough of the business cycle, but it may not<br />necessarily turn into a recession. There are many<br />conflicting opinions on the matter, and no one can<br />be certain what is to come, and if it will happen<br />before the end of the semester.","Hita Boddu (70%): The Braves are favored to win<br />the 2023 World Series with their odds to win it<br />all currently at +260. They also had the best<br />regular-season record at 104-58.","Hita Boddu (61%): The US Recession Probability<br />is at 60.83%, compared to 66.01% last month and<br />25.15% last year.","Simryn Patel (90%): A lot of sports betting sites<br />have braves favored at +250","Simryn Patel (30%): seems unlikely because<br />inflation is softening and there are no major<br />concerns at the moment","samiha sarwar (0%): I watched one game and they<br />lost, so I do not have high hopes.","samiha sarwar (35%): I hope not. I am feeling<br />optimistic about the economy.","Tori Harrill (80%): They have been successful so<br />far, and have ha a good track record.","Tori Harrill (70%): I'm not really sure... but it<br />looks to be headed in a decline.","Peyton Murry (80%): Braves and Dodgers are top<br />predictions for the World Series. ATL on top","Peyton Murry (20%): I don't think that there will<br />be a recession before November 29. Maybe next year<br />but not before our class is over.","Kang Lee (20%): I think it's very unlikely we win<br />the 2023 World Series again when we already had<br />such a shaky route to victory last time.","Kang Lee (70%): I think with how the economy<br />has been it is very likely that we will suffer a<br />recession.","Duy Do (90%): Atlanta Braves is in the lead now","Duy Do (40%): The recession rate is in downward<br />trend","Joe Ornstein (30%): Over the past 20 years, the<br />team with the best record in the regular season<br />has won the World Series about 1/3 of the time.<br />This is consistent with the Vegas odds, where the<br />Braves' money line is about +270, suggesting a 27%<br />chance. I'll split the difference between the two.","Joe Ornstein (2%): NBER generally won't call a<br />recession without two consecutive quarters of<br />negative GDP growth (though that's not, as I<br />understand it, a hard and fast rule). In the first<br />two quarters of 2023, we had steady 2% growth in<br />real GDP, so we definitely won't have two quarters<br />of negative growth by the end of November."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[1,0.80000000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.5,1,0.80000000000000004,0.94999999999999996,0.84999999999999998,0.94999999999999996,1,0.90000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.94999999999999996],"y":[0.96991168127860872,1.0044212782057003,1.0425615657586604,0.96868366017006335,1.0446443006163464,1.0265749789541587,0.95235453594941644,1.0269683749880643,1.0051546620903538,1.0297234387602656,1.0065483601065353,0.99161804667674003,1.0426436414476483,1.044666701485403,1.0467642377596349,0.99961825876962396],"text":["Ryan Wolkofsky (100%): There's nothing big coming<br />out in the near future.","Jacob Fortner (80%): Almost 100 million dollar<br />margin over super Mario bros which then has a<br />200 million dollar margin over 3rd place. With<br />no extremely notable movies coming out for the<br />remainder of this year, I see Barbie as remaining<br />at the top","Maggie Fertig (90%): It is ahead right now by<br />about $50,000 and it is unlikely to be beat in<br />less than 2 months.","Ansley Austin (90%): Barbie has earned more than<br />$1.38 billion worldwide this year, and I doubt<br />no other movie will surpass that in the next 2<br />months.","Rease Bauer (50%): never seen it but there were<br />other popular movies this year","Harini Mohan (100%): Barbie is at #1 right now.<br />Mario is not that far behind but Barbie has much<br />more publicity and advertisements. Also, I don't<br />think any new movie with that much fame will come<br />out before 2023.","Harshini Mohan (80%): So far it has generated 1.38<br />billion dollars and passed Super Mario Bros.","Bain Fulcher (95%): It is currently the highest<br />grossing movie of 2023, and is far ahead of the<br />runner up. I would honestly be very surprised<br />if any of the upcoming movies surpassed it,<br />especially since it is still in theaters.","Hita Boddu (85%): Barbie is the highest grossing<br />movie of 2023 and made $1.38 billion at the<br />worldwide box office.","Simryn Patel (95%): currently it is","samiha sarwar (100%): I personally will make it<br />the highest grossing movie. Besides me watching<br />it, the advertisement and the excitement around<br />the movie will make it the highest grossing movie.<br />Many people went to go watch it even if they<br />weren't interested in it.","Tori Harrill (90%): It brought in $1 billion sales<br />making history","Peyton Murry (30%): The Taylor Swift movie is<br />coming out and so is the Hunger Games","Kang Lee (10%): Incredibly unlikely as while<br />Barbie was a very mainstream and popular movie I<br />can't see it grossing more then 2.5B","Duy Do (10%): Barbie was banned in my country<br />=))))))))))","Joe Ornstein (95%): There are no movies premiering<br />between now and the end of the semester that I<br />could fathom grossing $1.5b in two months. Dune<br />Part 2 got pushed to 2024. The Marvels? Even<br />optimistic projections aren't crossing $1b, and<br />it's releasing two weeks before our deadline.<br />Killers of the Flower Moon?

But<br />most likely in the high 3.9s.","Ansley Austin (15%): I did not know this movie<br />was coming out, and I really don't think it'll<br />surpass the opening weekend of Catching Fire ($158<br />million).","Harini Mohan (30%): The average in Georgia is<br />3.20, I don't think anything substantial will<br />happen to the economy for the prices to go up that<br />much.","Harini Mohan (45%): It'll probably be famous but<br />neither Peeta or Katniss are going to be in it so<br />it just depends.","Harshini Mohan (70%): Russia and Ukraines war is<br />continuing which pressures Saudi Arabia to cut<br />production.","Harshini Mohan (35%): The movies gross is<br />decreasing with each one that gets released.","Hita Boddu (80%): The current gas prices is at<br />$3.93 which is very close to $4.","Hita Boddu (50%): \"The Ballad of Songbirds &<br />Snakes\" could top the charts for 2023 but maybe<br />not compared to the Hunger Games movies because<br />the Hunger Games movies were very popular when<br />they came out and the excitement around them has<br />fizzled away.","Maggie Fertig (65%): Gas prices have been hovering<br />by 4 for the past 3 months and has steadily been<br />getting closer.","Maggie Fertig (70%): All of the movies have had<br />high grossing opening weekends, but especially<br />since this movie has been long awaited and is a<br />sequel I predict it will have the highest of the<br />series.","Tori Harrill (50%): I feel like gas prices could<br />be reaching a peak and could start to decline or<br />they could increase. I'm not really sure.","Tori Harrill (40%): The original hunger games made<br />694.4 million. Because this hunger games isn't<br />so much of the original story, I feel less people<br />will want to see it","Ryan Wolkofsky (80%): The Middle East is exploding<br />in conflict right now. This will causes prices to<br />continue to rise.","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): The Hunger Games has lost<br />popularity since it first came out","Jack Whipple (90%): Gas has been getting very<br />expensive","Jack Whipple (90%): Everyone is hype for a new<br />Hunger Games movie","Bain Fulcher (50%): some action is being taken to<br />reduce gas prices, but i'm not confident that it<br />will lower them that quickly.","Bain Fulcher (40%): i feel like less people will<br />see the new one because it is a prequel, so it is<br />a lot of new characters, so people will not be as<br />excited to see it. also, they may want to wait and<br />see what reviews the movie gets before they go see<br />it themselves.","Joe Ornstein (45%): Markets for gasoline<br />futures suggest that investors think the price<br />will decline between now and December. I'm not<br />tremendously confident in this forecast, as it's<br />unclear whether renewed conflict in the Middle<br />East will cause supply disruptions. The spot price<br />for a barrel of Brent crude has gone up a few<br />dollars since the war in Gaza began last week.","Joe Ornstein (15%): The highest opening weekend<br />for a Hunger Games film is $158 million, and<br />that happened 10 years ago. For Songbirds and<br />Snakes to beat that, it would have to exceed the<br />opening weekend box office for Barbie, which had<br />significantly more buzz. I don't see it happening.","Rease Bauer (60%): With the trend of how the<br />economy is going i doubt gas prices with lower","Rease Bauer (45%): I havent even heard the news of<br />this new movie so unless they do more advertising<br />i dont think it will have as great of an opening<br />compared the the barbie movie that was advertised<br />for months to get people excited to see the movie","Kang Lee (30%): I believe it is unlikely with the<br />way gas prices are looking","Kang Lee (40%): I believe it's up in the air but<br />I'm leaning towards it not","Peyton Murry (55%): The Israeli-Hamas conflict","Peyton Murry (40%): I haven't seen much hype<br />around it. The Barbie movie has also done very<br />well.

However, in this time, they play<br />nobody of note.

If he does it'll be more likely<br />for something to happen and we get drawn into<br />active conflict.","Bain Fulcher (35%): We're not even receiving<br />any votes according to the AP Poll, so I'm not<br />optimistic.","Bain Fulcher (45%): The US has been sending<br />support to Israel and I think there is a chance<br />that we will get involved if other countries do,<br />but I think there is a good chance that we will<br />not be in active conflict with a Palestinian<br />militant group.","Jacob Fortner (15%): They're not a traditional<br />powerhouse and they play in a tough conference.","Jacob Fortner (99%): This is literally what we do,<br />gotta clutch up fr fr","Joe Ornstein (5%): UGA basketball ended last<br />season with a NET ranking of 157 (out of 363),<br />based on a pretty disappointing 16-16 record. The<br />season before that it was at 152. Since the NET<br />ratings are pretty strongly correlated with the<br />AP poll, it would be pretty improbable to make<br />the top 25 in one season. Looking back at the past<br />six seasons of Men's Basketball rankings, Georgia<br />hasn't made it to the top 25 once.","Joe Ornstein (25%): As of writing, the US Navy has<br />deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern<br />Mediterranean, ostensibly to deter Hezbollah<br />and other regional actors from taking this<br />opportunity to attack Israel. But it's unclear<br />what exactly this threat amounts to. The US does<br />not have a mutual defense pact with Israel, and<br />would not be obligated to intervene if Hezbollah<br />were to escalate its attacks on Israel. The US<br />military would only become actively involved in<br />the conflict if its personnel were attacked (an<br />outcome that Hezbollah leadership will be keen to<br />avoid) or if Iran intervenes directly (unlikely).","Peyton Murry (40%): It seems as if they haven't<br />done particularly well the past few years.<br />Moreover, I looked at a few people on their<br />roster, and it doesn't seem like they're the best<br />players out there.","Peyton Murry (45%): This is such a loaded<br />question. While President Biden has condemned the<br />terrorist attacks against Israel, he's also stated<br />that it is not okay to take these attacks as an<br />opportunity to be Islamaphobic. This shows that<br />this is a delicate conflict, which makes it hard<br />for an outside force to just step in. Moreover,<br />Biden said that at this moment, he doesn't feel<br />the need for the US military to engage in the war,<br />because, \"Israel has one of the finest fighting<br />forces\" (60 Minutes interview). Along with this,<br />the US is currently sending war materials to<br />Israel, which stands in place of our troops.<br />However, the US is literally known for stepping<br />in when difficult conflicts like this arise, and<br />many are calling for America to do so.

Second, I feel<br />like Joe Biden is more unpopular, because people<br />see him as a stagnant president that hasn't done<br />much since getting into office (this is not my<br />personal opinion). And, I think this opinion<br />stems from the bafflement of his oldness. I<br />mean, people call him \"Sleepy Joe.\" And, yes,<br />he is the oldest US president to get elected and<br />does seem to forget some things but CMONNN, the<br />man is literally running the United States of<br />America. I can't even function properly when I've<br />had less than 7 hours of sleep. Sorry, didn't<br />mean to get off on a tangent. I don't think his<br />approval ratings will rise 1) because of this ^<br />and 2) as the Israeli-Hamas conflict gets worse,<br />more Americans will want the US to get involved.<br />However, I don't think Biden will, unless there's<br />a large threat to American citizens.","Peyton Murry (65%): I should probably wait to<br />answer this until after the game tonight.

If his approval rating trends down in the<br />next few weeks, then you would need more than just<br />sampling error, but there's plenty of non-random<br />polling error. There were 7 polls in October that<br />showed him with an approval rating greater than<br />42%.","Joe Ornstein (88%): Coming back from a 3-1 deficit<br />is difficult, but not impossible.

12%.","Bain Fulcher (75%): right now he is very unpopular<br />because of his support of Israel. but, his<br />approval rate will probably increase, especially<br />if he is the only Democratic

Nonetheless, they show the<br />race tightening, with no clear front-runner in the<br />runoff. It all depends on how Bullrich's voters<br />break.

He's a 3<br />time world champion and has the best odds.","Harshini Mohan (50%): People believe Sweden could<br />join NATO in late November after \"Turkey took an<br />important step towards ratification\".","Bain Fulcher (5%): the only American on the grid<br />is Logan Sargeant, and he is ranked 21st on the F1<br />standings, so he will likely not win.

The overwhelming<br />favorite is the Netherland's Max Verstappen, who<br />has won 17/20 Grand Prix races this year and a<br />total of 524 points. Logan Sargeant's highest race<br />finish this season was 10th place, earning him 1<br />point.","Joe Ornstein (28%): The only two NATO allies that<br />haven't ratified Sweden's accession are Turkey and<br />Hungary. Erdogan has beef with Sweden for hosting<br />Kurdish separatist, and Orban has beef with<br />Sweden for criticizing the country's democratic<br />backsliding. It seems like both countries will<br />*eventually* ratify under pressure from the<br />United States, but they're dragging their feet<br />to get symbolic concessions out of Sweden (like<br />they did with Finland). It seems like the ball<br />has begun rolling, with Turkish foreign affairs<br />committee scheduled to begin debate on Thursday,<br />November 16. But the timeline is so short! If<br />the forecast were \"by the end of 2023\" I might be<br />more confident, but to get it done by November 29<br />they have only two weeks to get the ratification<br />through both parliaments, and then there's still<br />a few days after the final ratification for Sweden<br />to officially become a member. Seems like there's<br />no reason either country would rush it so quickly.","samiha sarwar (25%): When I looked it up we<br />haven't had much luck with winning.","samiha sarwar (80%): I can see this happing<br />Apparently they've been gradually integrated<br />anyways?","Duy Do (5%): There is only 5 racer from American","Duy Do (50%): 50-50","Ryan Wolkofsky (0%): Logan Sergeant is the only<br />American driver. He's on the worst team and hasn't<br />placed within the top 5 all year.","Ryan Wolkofsky (65%): Reuters reports<br />that NATO officials will meet on Nov<br />28-29.
