Because<br />of our winning streak when it comes to home games<br />if do lose a game it’s more likely to be an away<br />game. Furthermore, Florida has very strong players<br />and the home advantage so it’s very possible that<br />we lose that game.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (65%): I believe that although<br />much of my prediction is based on Stockton’s<br />performance I do think we could possibly lose one<br />game against Tennessee or possibly tech because<br />it is much later in the season. Given their<br />consistency, depth, and ability to step up in big<br />games at home, it’s reasonable to believe Georgia<br />has about a 65% chance to sweep all home games in<br />2025.","Alizah Mudaliar (40%): Although Georgia is<br />predicted to be a dominating team during its<br />away games, having a hard home game schedule,<br />improvements in other teams, and starting with<br />a new quarterback may provide some challenges in<br />winning every game. Homefield advantage may play<br />into this, but I think the hardest games for UGA<br />to win will be Florida and Tennessee.","Amanda Neighbour (22.6%): I believe the chance of<br />UGA winning all of our away games this upcoming<br />season is rather unlikely. The Bulldogs have a<br />home game win streak of 32, however, they lost to<br />Ole Miss and Alabama, as well as almost a third<br />time to Georgia Tech this previous season. I found<br />the average of the ESPN money lines and the match<br />up predictor percentages for each UGA away game in<br />the 2025 CFB Season. By averaging ESPN analytics<br />with betting odds, I incorporated a greater set<br />of data into my final prediction. Overall, based<br />on these factors, I estimate that UGA has around a<br />22% chance of winning every away game this season.","Anna Barton-Caucci (30%): I think there is a<br />30% chance that UGA wins all of the away games<br />because the probabilities of individual away<br />games against quality opponents or the opponents<br />that actually pose a threat to UGA (Florida and<br />Tennessee)averaged is around 60% and when you<br />multiply those together the odds are cut in half.","Anna Kneser (35%): There are 5 away games this<br />season, so I feel as though UGA is bound to lose<br />at least one of them. The games I am most worried<br />about are the Tennessee game and the Florida game.<br />UGA is known for their home field advantage with<br />having a long undefeated streak for home games. In<br />someone’s briefing, they said UGA is bound to lose<br />at least one game, and I think it is more likely<br />for them to lose an away game than a home game.<br />Based on the likelihood of UGA winning each game,<br />I calculated it and I think there is a 35% chance<br />they will lose at least one game.","Arshia Charkhian (45%): Georgia’s record<br />against the teams away from home has been solid<br />historically. Those teams have also not seen huge<br />upgrades during the offseason like Georgia has.<br />Tennessee will cause the most challenge since<br />Neyland is a hard place to travel to. Although the<br />UGA vs Tech is being played in Atlanta, there is<br />still strong support for the Bulldogs to the point<br />where it could be seen as a home game; the same<br />can be said about the Florida game.","Blake Martin (65%): While Georgia has shown to<br />be strong against these opponents in recent years<br />(The teams have not beaten us in 5+years) and<br />Kirby Smart's coaching is top-tier, there are<br />still challenges that I foresee as being issues<br />this upcoming season. New quarterbacks between<br />Auburn, Georgia and Tennessee spark uncertainty on<br />how each school will do. This is especially true<br />with our early-season matchup against Tennessee.<br />Auburns bye week and home field advantage also<br />could tip the scales in a close game. Florida<br />recently has improved talent and it being at a<br />neutral site could be a wildcard between the two.<br />Mississippi State and Georgia Tech might not seem<br />like big threats but unpredictable moments always<br />exist like when we played Ole Miss last season<br />and lost. In regards to Georgia Tech though, they<br />have not beaten us outside of Sanford Stadium<br />since 1999. I do not see that changing this year.<br />Given these, I'm optimistic but also cautious that<br />Georgia has a 65% chance of winning all their away<br />games this season.","Breanne Talley (40%): With a first-year<br />quarterback leading the way and a handful of<br />tough, emotional games ahead, Georgia is likely<br />to stumble at least once in its away schedule.<br />Whether it’s Florida in Jacksonville, Tennessee<br />in Knoxville, or a surprise upset against a<br />rival, the odds aren’t in favor of a flawless<br />road season. My forecast: Georgia goes 4–1 in away<br />games. My numbers come from taking the probability<br />of Georgia winning each game and multiplying them,<br />since it is a joint probability that they all win.<br />[Ten=.619]*[Aub=.913]*[Flor=.799]*[MS St=.973]*[Ga<br />Tech=.898]=[Probability of them winning all away<br />game=39.4%] I rounded up in my final answer for a<br />little bit of hope and uncertainty.","Caleb Lux (30%): After reviewing all of the<br />evidence, I am somewhat confident that UGA will<br />lose at least one of its away games this season.<br />While the chances of our victory for each game is<br />favorable, the uncertainty arising from Tennessee,<br />Florida, and potentially Auburn create enough<br />doubt to make it more likely than not that we will<br />lose at least one of those games. Specifically,<br />I assigned the following probabilities to win for<br />each game: State .97, Auburn .9, Tennessee .6,<br />Florida .6, Tech .95. This results in a 30% chance<br />that we win every game, thus my prediction.","Caroline Mattox (75%): Georgia has an extremely<br />tough schedule. Playing on the road in the SEC is<br />not an easy task no matter where you play. I think<br />there is a high chance that we lose an away game<br />this season. Florida alone presents an extreme<br />threat. I wouldn’t say any of these teams are<br />necessarily better than Georgia but I think there<br />is a very high chance that the fatigue sets in at<br />some point and we just get outplayed. Or maybe we<br />win a big game and the “we’ve got this” attitude<br />sets in and we just lose a game. I think we have<br />the capability to win every game we play but I am<br />nervous about the difficulty level of our schedule<br />and that’s why I have given a lower probability","Chris Haswell (60%): Most sports betting sites<br />have the Dawgs winning every away game. Some<br />experts predict Florida as being our only loss.<br />We've beaten Florida every year I've been here,<br />and I am confident in Gunner Stockton's abilities<br />based on the end of last season. It also feels<br />sacriligious to lose faith in the team, so I<br />predict a narrow Florida victory to cement our<br />away game dominance.","Cierra Green (40%): Of these games, the two<br />most concerning are Tennessee and Florida. When<br />researching various websites (ESPN, CBS, NY Times,<br />Online Athens, UGA Wire), each had different<br />opinions about these two games. However, even if<br />UGA were to win either one, the predicted ending<br />score was close (24 to 20 for GA v TN and 27 to<br />24 for GA v FL on two websites). Additionally,<br />DJ Lagway of Florida is projected to have a good<br />season. I believe it is very likely that Georgia<br />will win 4 of these games, but statistically, it<br />is unlikely that Georgia will win all 5. Using<br />joint probability, even if Georgia had a 90%<br />chance of winning each game, the probability would<br />only be 59% for winning all 5. Lowering those<br />chances for both Florida and Tennessee brings that<br />probability further down. I also asked my friends<br />(who are lifelong UGA fans) their opinion, and<br />they said UGA would lose at least one of these<br />games. One cited that Georgia has a track record<br />of underestimating certain teams and believes<br />we will lose to Mississippi State. Although not<br />professional opinions, their belief that Georgia<br />will lose a game despite their bias helped me in<br />this decision.","Elizabeth Nelson (23%): Courtesy of my football<br />obsessed boyfriend, I discovered ESPN's FPI win<br />probabilities for UGA's 2025 away/neutral site<br />regular season football games. As I learned in<br />class today, I found the joint probability by<br />multiplying each games' win probability. I think<br />23 is a safe guess because often Florida and<br />Georgia Tech are toss-up games, right at 50-50,<br />so it seems more in my favor that we will lose at<br />least one game on the road. I give Georgia a 23%<br />chance of winning all away and neutral site games<br />this regular season.","Sade Ezekiel (54%): Georgia has a good track<br />record of winning against every team they will<br />be playing away this season. Even though our team<br />will be starting a new quarterback, the confidence<br />is high that we will still have a successful<br />season. Our defense and offense have great stats<br />against these teams. The only game that could<br />potentially be an upset is the Auburn game. This<br />is because the Auburn game is considered the<br />oldest rivalry in the south, and because both<br />teams play each other very closely. Many believe<br />that the Jordan Harris stadium is cursed, so<br />playing there is also an intimidating factor for<br />a lot of teams. With that being said, if we were<br />to lose one game, the Auburn game would be the<br />one we might lose. I am still confident that with<br />Georgia's coaching and great athletes, we will<br />take home the win. Prediction = 54% confident that<br />we will win every away game!","Francesca Mariano (29%): Many of the briefs stated<br />that they think Georgia will loose at least one<br />of the away games. They emphasized the strength<br />and good record of Georgia, but also how games<br />can easily be upsets and we aren't positive<br />how many of the new players will pan out, on<br />Georgia's team and our opponents' teams. In the<br />the three years I have been a student at UGA, we<br />have had an incredible record, record breaking<br />records, of consecutive wins. I in no way claim<br />to be a football expert, but knowing how well we<br />typically perform and how well we are expected<br />to perform, I gave each away game a baseline of<br />80% of Georgia winning. With many of the briefs<br />saying we will loose at lease one, I decreased one<br />of the probabilities to 70%. I multiplied these<br />probabilities and got about 29% probability that<br />Georgia wins all their away games.","Ellie Null (79%): While I do believe that UGA will<br />have a great season and away game track record.<br />I also think that there Is one game that poses<br />a threat. I have no doubt in my mind that we<br />will beat Tennessee, Auburn and the rest of the<br />away game schedule. I do think that Florida will<br />poses a threat. this game is always hard to gauge<br />due to the lack of home field advantage and the<br />new factor of our new quarterback. i think that<br />Florida has an amazing quarterback and that it<br />wouldn't surprise me if they ended up taking the<br />win. I think it also depends on how Gunner does in<br />these first few games. These elements end lessen<br />my confidence in winning all of the games. there<br />is a 21 percent chance that Florida might beat us<br />in my mind. But I do think we will win everyone<br />but possibly this one.","Hunter Murray (26.2%): I used the ESPN win<br />percentage, the ESPN money line, and my own<br />knowledge and research about each game to build<br />a probability tree. I then took the compound<br />probability directly from that tree. I feel like I<br />could be slightly more confident, but I also think<br />we face risks in the Florida, GT, and especially<br />Tennessee.","Jackson Bost (30%): Georgia, with a physical<br />offense and evergreen defense, will have wins<br />at Tennessee (.8) and Auburn (.8) thanks to<br />their inexperienced offenses, notch an all<br />but guaranteed win against a historically<br />poor Mississippi State (.95), likely defeat an<br />all-or-nothing Tech (.75) team, but may fall short<br />when facing a veteran Florida (.65) team with the<br />explosive DJ Lagway. While some analysts and Vegas<br />still favor Georgia, this game will be Georgia's<br />biggest hurdle. When multiplying each games'<br />probability, the probability that UGA football<br />will win all of their away games this regular<br />season is .3.","James Hunter Darke (60%): I predict that Georgia<br />will lose an away game this regular season with<br />about 60% confidence. While the dawgs will be<br />favored in every game, with the rigorous schedule<br />and venues, they will drop one game. I have a<br />lot of faith in them, but I think we will fall<br />to either Tennessee or Auburn in an absolute<br />shootout.","Jhaycee Barnes (40%): Georgia is talented enough<br />to be favored in every away game, but winning all<br />of them is tough. Auburn and Tennessee both have<br />strong home-field advantages, and Florida and Tech<br />can get unpredictable (as we saw last season).<br />Even if Georgia is the better team overall, the<br />odds of slipping up at least once feel higher than<br />them pulling off a perfect season away.","Kira Fleischer (40%): Taking into account the<br />briefings, it seems likely that UGA will win<br />MOST of the away games, however Florida poses a<br />significant challenge. Considering the UF game,<br />the possible difficulty of Auburn, and the unknown<br />skills of Gunner, I find it unlikely that UGA will<br />win every single away game.","Kristoffer Fields (20%): I believe that UGA will<br />lose an away game because there are too many away<br />games with too many formidable opponents. Also I<br />mathematically calculated all of my probabilities<br />by multiplying my confidence for each away game<br />and I was at around roughly 30% chance all of<br />the games are won by the University of Georgia.<br />Furthermore, the football team, while still an<br />elite contender, has gone down in popularity<br />and quality over the years, therefore I think it<br />is safe to say that it is more likely that the<br />football team loses at least one away game.","Liz Yancey (22%): I am 40% confident that UGA<br />will win every away game this regular season.<br />I looked up UGA's chance of winning/losing on<br />ESPN's Matchup Predictor. They all predicted that<br />UGA would win every away game. I then multiplied<br />every chance UGA would win and the result was .22,<br />which is why I think there's a 22% chance of them<br />winning every away game this regular season.","Manuv Datta (60%): It is my belief that UGA will<br />not be successful in winning all of their away<br />games this season. I base this prediction on the<br />results of last season's performances. There were<br />various games last year in which UGA struggled<br />mightly with UNRANKED opponents. With the strength<br />of the current schedule, and the amount of ranked<br />opponents away, I find it likely that UGA will<br />struggle early in a game and not be able to make<br />a comeback. This loss will not remove them from an<br />opportunity at the college football playoff.","Mateo Ceron (40%): I chose 40% because I had a<br />conversation with a couple of the people that did<br />briefings and realized that a majority of them<br />were pretty confident for most of UGA's schedule,<br />excluding one or two games. In class we also heard<br />from one of the people that did briefings AND<br />did the math for that specific person's thoughts,<br />which came out to about a 42% chance of winning<br />out for our whole away schedule, but only based<br />off one person's analysis (and that 42% chance was<br />optimistic). Therefore I decided I would subtract<br />a couple of percentage points to make up for any<br />biases in his percentage predictions and everyone<br />else's (because obviously we want our team to<br />succeed), and ended up at a 40% chance of winning<br />our whole schedule.","Nic Curtis (30%): To come up with my probability,<br />I assigned each game their own probability and<br />multiplied them together. .85 for Tennessee,<br />Auburn, and Georgia Tech, .55 for Florida, .95<br />for Charlotte and Mississippi State. I did this<br />because the question is a joint probability<br />question and each event is independent of each<br />other.","Owen Johnston (31.752%): I give GA a probability<br />0.7 of beating TN given that TN is a difficult<br />home environment, but they lost a lot of good<br />offensive players to the draft and have a brand<br />new, untested quarterback. I give GA a probability<br />of 0.9 to beat Auburn given that Auburn has<br />lost so many players to the portal and has poor<br />preseason prospects. I give GA a probability of<br />0.8 to beat FL due to the neutral site location<br />which eliminates home advantage and an improved<br />team, however, the FL quarterback missed a lot of<br />last season and has less experience. I give UGA<br />a probability of 0.9 to beat MS State. MS State<br />is last in the SEC and had a poor recruiting<br />record. Finally, I give GA a probability of<br />0.7 to beat Tech given the close game from last<br />season, however, it cannot be outweighed by<br />Tech's overall offensive line performance and<br />the fact that I think the game being played at<br />Mercedes-Benz stadium will benefit UGA. All of<br />these probabilities multiplied together give UGA<br />a 0.31752 probability of winning all of their away<br />games this season.","Paul Frilingos (22.5%): ESPN Analytics has<br />probabilities calculated on their website for<br />each game of the 2025 college football season.<br />This takes into account all factors related to<br />performance, like recruiting, transfers, and home<br />field advantage. Multiplying the probability that<br />Georgia wins each away game this season together<br />creates the joint probability of about 22.5%.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (27%): I read<br />my classmates’ briefings and asked ChatGPT to<br />break down the betting odds in order to calculate<br />the win probability for each game and then<br />calculate the overall chance of going undefeated<br />on the road. According to ChatGPT, based on the<br />information in the briefings, the chances of<br />winning are about 74% for Tennessee, 68% for<br />Auburn, 71% for Florida, 86% for Georgia Tech, and<br />close to 90% for Mississippi State. Multiplying<br />these gives around a 25–35% chance of winning them<br />all. As Hunter put it, Tennessee’s fast offense,<br />Auburn’s home-field advantage, and Florida’s<br />emerging quarterback make those games real risks.<br />So I think 4–1 is much more likely than winning<br />all the away games.","Reese Fabritius (25%): Using ESPN stats, UGA<br />has about a 6.5% chance of going undefeated<br />overall—this season. However, if you multiply the<br />probability that UGA will win each of its away<br />games (0.65, 0.7, 0.7, 0.8, 0.85) you get around<br />0.22. However, I think those numbers are slightly<br />inflated by preseason optimism, and UGA will be<br />more greatly favored as the season goes on.","Ruhi Doddamani (28%): I did the joint probability<br />calculation on all of the games, multiplied them<br />all up. I read through the briefs and tried to<br />familiarize myself with which games are most<br />likely to be the team's pitfall this season. I<br />think Florida presents the biggest challenge, just<br />by players' stats. I also looked at the betting<br />sites' numbers, and after accounting for their<br />inflated lines to get people to bet more, Fanduel<br />and Prizepicks are coming around the mid-20s range<br />as well. ESPN has a 22%. 28% UGA goes undefeated<br />is my most generous guess. Fingers crossed!","Ryan Marx (80%): The reason that i believe that<br />the Bulldogs will only have around an 80 percent<br />chance of winning every away and neutral ground<br />game comes down to what teams and are on the<br />schedule and the location at which they are being<br />played. Starting with those at home the difficult<br />games of the season are: Alabama who we lost<br />against 41-34 last year,Texas which was a close<br />call with Georgia only beating them 22 to 19 in<br />2024, and Finally there is Ole Miss which Georgia<br />also lost against in 2024 by an embarrassing 10<br />to 24. Furthermore our remaining games at home<br />are made up of lower ranked schools such as<br />Marshall(which lost to Georgia 13-3 back in 2004<br />and Austin Peay( which was absolutely crushed back<br />in 2018 by a whopping 45-0). Compared to the Away<br />and Neutral Schedule which makes up around 5 games<br />of the season the only two legitimate schools that<br />pose any threat to this challenge are Tennessee<br />who put up a slugging match that resulted in a<br />31-17 victory. and Auburn, a school that is a<br />bitter rival to Georgia and also narrowly lost<br />by 31 to 13 last year. Out of the 5 home Games I<br />believe that only Tennessee has any real chance<br />to beat Georgia, of course you always have the<br />home field advantage, something that Tennessee has<br />locked in while playing at Neyland, combine this<br />with the fact that Georgia has typically struggled<br />with Away Games and that Tennessee always puts<br />up a strong offense with Breakneck plays leads me<br />to believe that outside of the 80 percent chance<br />Georgia does win every away and neutral Game, then<br />there is a 20 percent chance that Georgia will<br />lose an away or neutral game","Sarah Kate Maher (54%): We've already beat the<br />teams on our away schedule, and though some of<br />them might be improving, they will not be at the<br />level that Georgia will be this year. The reason<br />my probability is so low is that we've been<br />suprised by how UGA plays before, and can never be<br />too sure, especially in trap games like MS State.<br />We also almost lost to GA Tech last year, and<br />Florida and Auburn are always tougher games.","Sasha Mahtani (35%): UGA has some fierce<br />competitors considering their away games, and I<br />am most worried about Auburn and Georgia Tech.<br />After today's briefings in class and learning<br />that Auburn's team has a decent outlook on their<br />season, I feel most threatened that they will beat<br />us. Considering our performance against Georgia<br />Tech last year and how we barely scraped by past<br />a win, there is some chance they will beat us<br />as well, especially considering their home base<br />advantage.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (67%): I believe UGA Football<br />will win all of their away games this season<br />primarily because of their away record. In the<br />past 5 seasons, UGA only lost 3 away games, 2 of<br />them last season. Those 2 teams are home games<br />this season, so the other teams are ones UGA is<br />known to beat. The closest matchup last year that<br />is an away game this year is Georgia Tech, and it<br />was under presiding quarterback Gunner Stockton's<br />substitution for Carson Beck that led us to<br />victory in the eight-overtime thriller. That being<br />said, it is extremely easy to lose a game for any<br />sort of reason, which is why I am optimistically<br />cautious- at 67%.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (80%): I think that Georgia<br />will win all away games this normal season.<br />I am 80% confident. I considered factors like<br />recruitment, transfers, distance to stadium,<br />professional opinions by sports predicting<br />professionals, effectiveness/character/newness of<br />coaches, home and away game advantage performance,<br />historical wins in matches (scores and wins),<br />quarterback performance, offence vs defense<br />performance, and the home game lineup (UGA<br />home game lineup is intense). I chose 80% as my<br />confidence level because I am only concerned about<br />one game in the normal season. I am concerned<br />about UGA losing the Tech game after their<br />performance last year.","Zafar Ali (45%): Originally I believed that there<br />was little to no chance that the UGA football<br />team would be able to win every single away game.<br />However, based on the briefings and overall class<br />discussion, I have been swayed a little to the<br />idea that there is a more likely chance they will.<br />Based on the pervious 2024 season, UGA lost two of<br />the away games. Those being Ole Miss and Alabama.<br />Looking at this year's schedule, the teams they<br />will be playing do not seem as difficult as last<br />year. Florida seems to be the biggest challenge as<br />their quarter back is returning from the previous<br />season and has been noted to be performing quite<br />well. Aside from this, Gunner Stockton is now<br />taking the role as starter QB for this season.<br />We can't say for certain how well he will do,<br />however, he was able to help the team through<br />those games. I am not 100% on them winning because<br />there are multiple games rather than just one. We<br />have to account for each. However, to conclude, I<br />believe there is a 45% because I still think they<br />will at least lose one game."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.40000000000000002],"y":[1.0218489898834378],"text":"Crowd (40%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.52000000000000002],"y":[0.97815030547790227],"text":"Joe Ornstein (52%): It's a bit too early for<br />me to trust any of the point spreads listed on<br />the sportsbooks -- they all seem a touch too<br />conservative.

Not only does this precedent make it highly<br />unlikely in my opinion, but we also have the state<br />of Florida as a barrier that takes the brunt of<br />damage/impact from hurricanes. If you look at past<br />hurricanes that were Cat 4 or higher when making<br />contact with the U.S. (specifically Florida),<br />none have retained their momentum and crossed<br />into GA as a Cat 4, instead dying down to a Cat 2<br />or 3 instead. On top of all this, our discussion<br />in class further reinstated the fact that such a<br />high category hurricane is highly unlikely. But<br />unnatural events can always occur, and weather<br />isn't easy to predict or track so taking that<br />into account I set my probability as something<br />relatively low, but not 0.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (35%): The Epstein Files are<br />unlikely to be released because the documents have<br />recently just been put through the House under a<br />different process and it takes the government many<br />months to process any sort of documentation. There<br />is still a possibility however as recently the<br />files were turned by House Committee and they've<br />been threatening to relase the files into the<br />public.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (5%): I believe there can only<br />be a 5 percent chance of a category 4 hurricane<br />hitting Georgia beacuse of the fact that as<br />the hurricane would hit the coast it would lose<br />significant amount of power on the land and<br />become at most a category 3. While the Atlantic<br />hurricane season runs through November, historical<br />records show that major hurricanes almost never<br />make landfall in Georgia, so the risk remains<br />very low even during peak months. While it is<br />not impossible for a Category 4 storm to reach<br />the state, the combination of limited coastline,<br />typical storm tracks, and rapid weakening after<br />landfall makes the probability very low.","Alizah Mudaliar (30%): Because of the limited<br />time frame of the forecast, complex legal issues<br />regarding certain document releases, and mixed<br />bipartisan support, I think there is about a<br />30% chance of some document of the Epstein files<br />being released. There is a lot of public pressure<br />and some Republican representatives supporting<br />the release, which may help sway support for the<br />files’ release. There is likely a higher chance<br />for the House to pass a resolution to release the<br />files than the Senate.","Alizah Mudaliar (5%): I think there is a 5% chance<br />of a hurricane (Cat. 4 or 5) hits Georgia. This<br />season is expected to be strong due to a longer<br />ENSO-neutral phase in the Pacific and strong<br />waves and winds from the West African Monsoon<br />moving west. The Georgia coast is relatively small<br />compared to the Gulf, Florida, and the Carolinas.<br />The curvature of the coast provides a buffer<br />against a strong hurricane turning sharply to<br />hit as a Category 4. It has been almost 127 years<br />since a Category 4 hurricane hit Georgia.","Amanda Neighbour (10%): From a logistical<br />standpoint, September-November 25th is a very<br />thin timeline, not to mention how slow Congress<br />is. Introducing a bill, going through committees,<br />having it scheduled and passed by both chambers,<br />and signed all before November 25th is a compact<br />timeline--one that can not be expected by this<br />hyperpartisan Congress. Republicans have the<br />majority in both houses, and will more than likely<br />advocate for the president. It is also possible<br />that information could be released through court<br />processes or executive branch declassification.<br />S. 2557 and H.Res. 577 are both in the Judiciary<br />Committees with no further action. A Democratic<br />amendment requiring the DOJ to release the<br />Epstein files was blocked by House Republicans<br />in mid-July. Speaker Mike Johnson is against the<br />release as claiming victim protections. Partial<br />progress can be expected, but passage seems lofty.","Amanda Neighbour (4%): The most convincing<br />evidence is that the last major hurricane to hit<br />Georgia was in 1898, despite global warming and<br />differing conditions. We are in an ENSO-neutral<br />state, which is a middle ground between El Niño<br />and La Niña, where hurricanes can be strengthened,<br />but not as much as a La Niña. The hurricanes<br />that hit Georgia in the past few years hit as<br />a tropical storm and a category 2 hurricane. A<br />hurricane with windspeed of 130-156 mph is very<br />unlikely to hit Georgia. Because of the shape<br />of Georgia's coast and the barrier islands,<br />Georgia receives very little direct hits and has<br />a moderate-high return period--the frequency in<br />number of years a location will be affected by a<br />major hurricane.","Ana Valencia (25%): Based on historical data on<br />the inquiry procedure, it indicates only about a<br />15 percent chance that a disclosure resolution is<br />adopted in a given Congress. I believe there is<br />higher chances for the House to pass a resolution<br />compared to the Senate, since H.Res. 589 has<br />already advanced through the Rules Committee and<br />could be scheduled for debate. I would like to<br />assign a 25 percent chance of the probability<br />that either chamber adopts a measure explicitly<br />directing DOJ to release Epstein-related files<br />before November 25, 2025. The most plausible path<br />is House adoption of H.Res. 589 under suspension<br />or by rule in September or October.","Ana Valencia (0.6%): The only known Cat-4 Georgia<br />hurricane landfall was in 1851 to the present,<br />and the Atlantic season runs June 1 to November<br />30 with peak mid-August to mid-October, so it<br />is highly unlikely there is one that will make<br />landfall because it is a chance of 1/174 hurricane<br />seasons. Furthermore, because of the geological<br />conditions of our state, landfalls are extremely<br />rare and the only Cat-4 landfall was on Cumberland<br />Island, GA. NOAA’s August 7 update still calls<br />for an above-normal 2025 season with 5 to 9<br />hurricanes, but it is for the whole basin and not<br />just for GA.","Anna Barton-Caucci (25%): Based on everything<br />happening right now, I think there is a 30% chance<br />of real legislative action before the November<br />25th deadline. The committee investigations will<br />probably continue and we might see some individual<br />documents released, but comprehensive legislation<br />requiring full disclosure seems unlikely.The<br />biggest factors working against this are Speaker<br />Johnson's resistance, the limited time frame,<br />and the complex legal issues involved in document<br />release. While public interest is high and there's<br />some bipartisan support, those political obstacles<br />and setbacks are just too significant to overcome<br />quickly.","Anna Barton-Caucci (3%): I believe that it is<br />highly unlikely that a hurricane will hit the<br />state of Georgia before November 25th because<br />Georgia has only ever had 1 hurricane of this<br />category before and we have a convex coastline<br />and are mostly protected by Florida. There have<br />been very few instances of hurricanes in Georgia,<br />especially hurricanes of this category.","Anna Kneser (20%): Even though the Epstein files<br />are being given to lawmakers, it will take longer<br />than November 25th for there to be legislation<br />passed releasing the documents. Historically,<br />it has taken longer than a few months for<br />legislation to pass, and with the hesitancy of<br />some governmental officials like the Speaker of<br />the House and Trump, it will be more difficult<br />than meets the eye. A more realistic expectation<br />for the files would be committee hearings or<br />subpoenas.","Anna Kneser (4%): There has not been a category<br />IV hurricane or higher that has hit Georgia in<br />over 100 years. Even though we are in an unusually<br />active season, I do not think that is enough<br />evidence to persuade me to think a percentage<br />higher than 5%. Logistically, it makes sense<br />to think historically for this forecast, and<br />historically, it is highly unlikely. These types<br />of hurricanes are more likely to hit the Carolinas<br />or Florida.","Arshia Charkhian (35%): The Epstein controversy<br />has become a bipartisan concern, and recently,<br />many of Trump’s supporters have questioned the<br />administration over his attempts to withhold the<br />files, especially in light of the promises he made<br />during his campaign. This will keep pressure high,<br />but given the systemic and logistical constraints<br />for releasing the Epstein files by November 25,<br />I would forecast a 35% chance that they will be<br />released.","Breanne Talley (25%): I don’t think that Congress<br />will pass legislation to release any of the files<br />publicly. They have already passed a vote not to<br />even let the matter on the floor. They are also<br />currently on a recess until September. When they<br />get back to meet the deadline of November 25th, it<br />would have to be one of the first things that they<br />plan to see. Since it will also be right before<br />the beginning of the fiscal year, the National<br />Budget will take priority before anything, so that<br />there is not a government shutdown.","Caleb Lux (25%): I find it unlikely that Congress<br />will vote to release any of the Epstein files,<br />but this issue has the potential to change<br />significantly without any warning or pretext.<br />Unless Trump's opposition to their release changes<br />(unlikely), the Republican-controlled chambers<br />will not vote to do so, irrespective of any public<br />sentiment. This issue will turn into a generic<br />punch line for Democrats where there will be a<br />waning opposition against the immovable force of<br />a majority that doesn't want to act on anything<br />related to Epstein. But who knows?","Caleb Lux (2%): There is an incredibly low chance<br />that a hurricane of this intensity will hit<br />Georgia by the end of the semester. While we will<br />likely bare the wrath of intense storms and the<br />remnants of some hurricanes, any category IV or<br />V storm will likely dissipate in the Gulf and on<br />Florida before reaching Georgia. Even last year<br />with Hurricane Helene, it made landfall on Florida<br />as a Category IV but reduced significantly into a<br />cat-2 by the time it got here.","Caroline Mattox (35%): I do not foresee Congress<br />passing any legislation to get the Epstein files<br />released before November 25th. Like many people<br />said in their briefings, the process to have these<br />documents released is extremely lengthy and it<br />is not something that just happens overnight. I<br />believe there is also not enough willingness to<br />push for these documents to be released for them<br />to actually be released before November 25th.","Caroline Mattox (45%): It is hard for me to<br />go above 45% for this topic because as stated<br />in class, we have not seen a hurricane of this<br />caliber hit the state of Georgia in quite awhile<br />and it would definitely be an abnormal occurrence.<br />Because of this, I just do not see it happening<br />this year. But there is also a part of me that<br />wants to think it could happen because the weather<br />has become so much more intense over the past<br />several years.","Chris Haswell (40%): I am leaning towards no,<br />simply because the President has done everything<br />in his power to suppress Congress from releasing<br />the Epstein Files. Previous motions to even<br />discuss the release have been vetoed, making<br />official legislation by November a long shot.<br />However I am not confident in this prediction,<br />simply because Epstein has become a media<br />firestorm and rallying cry for Democrats. Even<br />Republicans realize the seriousness of the<br />situation. On August 25, House Oversight Chair<br />James Comer subpoenaed the Epstein estate, citing<br />the federal government's \"mismanagement\" of the<br />case. Nevertheless, I think any revelations will<br />not come from legislation but from executive or<br />committee action. I believe Trump has too much<br />control over his party to let them handle a<br />scandal of this magnitude .","Chris Haswell (6%): I might be less confident than<br />most that a hurricane won't hit Georgia, mainly<br />because changing weather patterns make hurricane<br />predictions more difficult. That being said, it<br />seems extremely unlikely that a Cat IV will hit<br />given the NOAA data and the fact that a Cat IV<br />hurricane hasn't hit Georgia in over 100 years.","Blake Martin (35%): I gave this probability<br />a 35% because Congress shut down early to<br />avoid addressing the Epstein situation. The<br />administration says that there is no client list<br />and that they have reviewed the files and have<br />not found things verifying conspiracy theories<br />surrounding Epstein. If what the things said about<br />are true, the Epstein files will impact both major<br />figures in political parties. It is unlikely that<br />Congress, under the Trump administration, will<br />continue to take strides and accountability on<br />this issue when they have said prior that things<br />are all clear and they've given their explanation.<br />I gave it a little bit more percent however<br />because Republicans might feel pressure from<br />their home districts, or social media might form<br />a coalition vote with the democrats to pressure<br />Congress to pass legislation.","Blake Martin (5%): I said that the probability of<br />there being a category 4 hurricane making landfall<br />in Georgia before November 25 was 5%. We have<br />not had direct landfall in Georgia for decades<br />and a lot of that has to do with the shape of the<br />Georgia coast and the way the hurricanes curve.<br />Hurricanes often lose strength when they move<br />northward, especially when meeting with colder<br />waters so I believe there is an incredibly low<br />percentage for their to be a category 4 hurricane<br />hitting landfall in Georgia. I gave it 5% though<br />because at the end of the day you never know and<br />weather can change rapidly.","Cierra Green (30%): Due to Trump's involvement<br />with the Epstein Files and the allegations against<br />him, it is against the interest of Republicans to<br />release information that may affect the reputation<br />of their party. With a House and Senate Republican<br />majority, it would be very difficult to pass this<br />legislation. Additionally, with ongoing trials<br />and the necessity to review these files prior to<br />release, it is unlikely this would occur before<br />November 25th. Although I believe a release<br />will occur at some point, this is too soon of a<br />deadline.","Cierra Green (1%): Due to the positioning of<br />Georgia, it is extremely difficult for category<br />4+ hurricanes to make landfall. Typically, a<br />hurricane must pass through land to reach Georgia.<br />As a hurricane reaches land, the wind speeds<br />drop dramatically. Therefore, a hurricane is most<br />likely going to be less than a category 4 once it<br />hits Georgia. Additionally, there has only been 1<br />recorded Category 4+ hurricane in Georgia, which<br />occurred in 1898. Although there are expected to<br />be above normal conditions this year, I do not<br />believe a category 4+ hurricane in Georgia will be<br />a result. Rather, this may result in a category 3<br />at best.","Elizabeth Nelson (3%): I focused on the historical<br />rarity of major hurricane landfalls in Georgia and<br />the changing risk of environment due to climate<br />change and this year's unusually active Atlantic<br />hurricane outlook. The size and shape of Georgia's<br />coast has shielded it from the brunt of major<br />hurricanes. Given the statistics of previous<br />hurricanes that have hit Georgia and since only<br />one has been recorded as a Category 4, I would<br />say that it is highly unlikely. It is worth<br />considering that this hurricane season is supposed<br />to be extremely active, but there are external<br />factors worth considering like what states are<br />doing on the ground to prepare, the defunding of<br />the NOAA, and comparing analog years like 2005<br />and 2020 which were also active hurricane seasons<br />where Georgia was spared.","Ellie Null (5%): After researching this<br />forecasting question, I am 95% confident that<br />there will not be a hurricane 4 (or above).<br />since the last hurricane that had this high level<br />category was in 1898. furthermore, due to the<br />structure of Georgias Coast and the dynamics of<br />hurricane winds, the hurricanes that do occur this<br />season will hit the Carolinas or Florida. However,<br />I am stay at a 5% chance due to the fact that<br />there is supposed to an extra active season this<br />year and climate change could alter the normal<br />statistics.","Francesca Mariano (10%): Many Americans and<br />members of Congress feel strongly about the<br />release of the Epstein files. Despite this<br />resulting in many members of Congress from both<br />sides of the aisle publicly calling for the<br />release and introducing bipartisan legislation<br />for the release of the files, I do not see them<br />demonstrating great fervor to bring the seven<br />different resolutions to a vote, and those that<br />are, seemingly, lack political clout. Congress<br />is also currently in recess, preventing us from<br />analyzing the current state of their stance on<br />this issue legislatively. Also, seeing as Congress<br />is already gaining access to the files through<br />the House Oversight Committee's subpoena, leads<br />me to believe that they will deem legislation<br />unnecessary at this point in time. What I am<br />not sure to believe is whether, after initial<br />transmittance of the files, Congress will be<br />satisfied enough with this arrangement to not turn<br />to legislation. Public prediction forums also have<br />it being extremely unlikely, currently sitting<br />at negative one percent, that the House will pass<br />legislation publicly releasing the files. This<br />information all together leads me to believe that<br />Congress will not pass legislation to publicly<br />release the Epstein files before November 25<br />and that the percentage probability is circling<br />10%. Due to the unpredictable nature of this<br />administration and its effects on Congress, I do<br />not think the probability is simply at zero, but<br />I also believe the probability is still very low,<br />leading me to my previously stated prediction of<br />10%.","Francesca Mariano (3%): Many of the briefs<br />highlighted that a category IV or higher hurricane<br />has not made landfall in Georgia in over 100<br />years, making another one hitting this year highly<br />unlikely. We are lucky enough to have a number<br />of barrier islands and a convex coast, causing<br />many hurricanes to lose momentum before making<br />landfall. Also, Many hurricanes hit Florida first<br />before reaching Georgia, again causing hurricanes<br />to lose momentum. Again, many of the briefs had<br />their probabilities from around 1 to 5%. Given<br />this, I think 3% is a median probability and<br />represents the unlikelihood of a hurricane, but<br />still allows room for the slight chance there may<br />be one (knock on wood).","Ellie Null (20%): I do no think there is a high<br />chance of any part of the files being released by<br />legislation before November 25th. after reviewing<br />all the information and the briefs I have come to<br />the conclusion that there is a lengthy process of<br />evening starting to release one document to the<br />public that they would have already had to have<br />started opening files to dissect them and start<br />the release process. furthermore, congress is in<br />recess right now so it is just highly unlikely<br />that they will release any information. I also<br />think that there are bigger issues at play and<br />that the files will be pushed down the list of<br />importance.","Hunter Murray (48%): I believe, based on the<br />amount of bipartisan support releasing the<br />Epstein files has, that a resolution calling for<br />the limited release of files will be passed in<br />either the Senate or the House within the next<br />couple months. I am pretty confident in this<br />answer, somewhere around 60%, but there is also<br />the distinct possibility that Trump decides to<br />release files himself and that his release stunts<br />any action from Congress. Trump is notoriously<br />unpredictable, but I will put it at a 70% chance<br />that he does not release any Epstein files<br />that stunt an act of Congress. Based on these<br />confidence levels, I end up at a 48% compound<br />probability.","Hunter Murray (2%): Based on Georgia's hurricane<br />history, its protective geographical features,<br />and the relative uncertainty about the El Niño,<br />La Niña, and ENSO-neutral status of the oceans, I<br />think there is an extremely low chance of a major<br />hurricane in GA, with an even lower chance of a<br />hurricane that is a category IV or V.","Jack Lutz (5%): Georgia's coast is nestled between<br />Florida and South Carolina, having only a very<br />short stretch directly exposed to the Atlantic<br />Ocean. Hurricanes dissipate once they make<br />landfall, and almost every hurricane that has hit<br />Georgia since it has been monitored has passed up<br />through Florida, and has thus reduced in category<br />since it is starved of warm ocean water. Only<br />once, back at the end of the 1800s, did a Category<br />4 hurricane make landfall in the State of Georgia,<br />and I am very confident it will not happen this<br />year, but not quite certain.","Jackson Bost (35%): Congress has several hurdles<br />to jump before the release of the Epstein Files<br />is close to reality. If there is renewed effort<br />to release the Files, the votes won't be there.<br />In the House, 6/9 who abstained on the previous<br />Epstein Files vote would likely vote against<br />any new proposal due to either needing Trump's<br />support in the 2026 midterms or their growing role<br />alongside his administration, leaving only two in<br />any position to vote for it. Senate Republicans<br />also hold a comfortable majority, with few<br />expected to defect over fear of Trump.","Jackson Bost (5%): Although the National Oceanic<br />and Atmospheric Administration expects this<br />hurricane season to be above average and their<br />tracking systems are underfunded, the odds are<br />not in favor of a Category 4 or greater hurricane<br />striking Georgia. There is a century-long<br />precedent against Cat 4s, unfavorable geography,<br />and unworried conditions in our coastal<br />communities, warranting a minimal probability of<br />5.","James Hunter Darke (60%): No I don’t think the<br />Trump administration has any desire or to release<br />them. I could see them being released if public<br />pressure becomes too high, but public pressure<br />is already high and they keep pushing it off.<br />If there seemed to be any sort of progress on<br />releasing the files my answer would be different.","Jhaycee Barnes (15%): There’s bipartisan push<br />and public pressure to release the files, but<br />leadership is blocking it and DOJ is already<br />handing over redacted files. Additionally,<br />Congress almost never moves this fast on<br />transparency bills, discharge petitions don't<br />succeed most of the time, and scandals like this<br />are usually not handled with legislation.","Jhaycee Barnes (2%): Georgia’s coastline is small,<br />and in history there’s basically only been one<br />direct Cat 4 landfall here (in 1898). This year’s<br />season is active with several big storms out<br />there, but the chances of one lining up perfectly<br />to hit Georgia as a category 4 are super slim.","Kira Fleischer (15%): Historically, it is rare<br />that legislation leading to the release of the<br />Epstein files is able to be passed. However, there<br />is definitely still a chance that legislation is<br />passed by the House. All in all, I am just not<br />confident that Congress will pass any legislation<br />before the quick deadline of November 25th.","Kira Fleischer (2%): Analyzing Georgia's history,<br />Georgia has not seen a category IV hurricane in<br />decades, and recent years have not shown any clear<br />hints of any looming. Despite the fact that this<br />hurricane season is expected to be worse than<br />past ones, a category IV hurricane is rare, and<br />Georgia's geography makes it extremely likely that<br />any hurricane will weaken to below Category IV by<br />the time it reaches the state.","Kristoffer Fields (15%): I predict there to be a<br />15 percent chance that Congress will release an<br />Epstein file because I find the likelihood of it<br />occurring extremely unlikely due to the ammount of<br />barriers to releasing the file and the fact that<br />if an executive order is placed it still will not<br />count for the question since it explicitly says<br />congress.","Kristoffer Fields (10%): It will not have a<br />cateogry IV hurricane this fall. I did my briefing<br />assignment on this topic and the statistical<br />probability of it occurring is very low even when<br />accounting for confounding variables like El Niño<br />and La Niña currents and rising sea temperatures.<br />I argue there is a less than 5 percent chance<br />that a CAT IV comes to Georgia if the question<br />where phrases as “will a hurricane make landfall<br />in georgia” the answer may be different but the<br />parameter of it being a CAT IV makes it rare.","Liz Yancey (5%): The chances of Congress passing<br />legislation to release the Epstein files are<br />pretty slim. Even though it appears to be a<br />bipartisan issue, the Republicans still control<br />both the House and the Senate, meaning that<br />if legislation is proposed, it probably won't<br />even pass cloture. This is because there are<br />still Republican representatives who are afraid<br />of being disloyal to their party and the Trump<br />administration. I think it also depends on whether<br />anything more interesting happens in the news<br />between now and Nov. 25.","Liz Yancey (5%): I read through the briefings<br />and agreed with them. I think the geography of<br />the coastline protects Georgia from hurricanes<br />and other natural disasters than less shielded<br />surrounding states. Elizabeth highlighted that<br />even the strongest hurricane that impacted Georgia<br />did not make landfall in the state. Instead, it<br />directly hit Florida first and was also weakened<br />by the time it reached Georgia. However, this<br />being an extremely active hurricane season<br />indicates that there will be more Category 4+<br />hurricanes. Due to Georgia's coastline being so<br />short, the probability that a strong hurricane<br />hits the coast is still unlikely, considering<br />that historically, those hurricanes do not make<br />landfall in Georgia first and weaken by the time<br />they reach the coast.","Manuv Datta (60%): No, Congress will not release<br />information on the Epstein files before November<br />25th. As Speaker Mike Johnson has recently gone<br />to the lengths of even shutting down and putting<br />the House in Recess until September, I believe<br />any further investigative information on Epstein<br />would incriminate far too many powerful and<br />wealthy individuals, who are likely going to great<br />lengths to protect themselves. If any information<br />is released, it will likely be highly doctored<br />and redacted, however I see this as also very<br />unlikely.","Manuv Datta (5%): I make this prediction rooted<br />in data depicting the very rare occurrences of<br />category 4 or above hurricanes hitting Georgia.<br />The path of how air flows in the Atlantic<br />naturally shifts almost all tropical storms<br />either towards Florida or further northeast. While<br />there is increasing unpredictably due to climate<br />change, the reality is that hurricanes dissipate<br />upon landfall fairly quickly. And as a strong<br />category 4 or stronger hurricane is almost sure<br />to hit Florida first, there is an extremely high<br />probability that if a hurricane does hit this<br />year, it will likely weaken below a category 4<br />before it reaches Georgia.","Mateo Ceron (33%): Because this has been a very<br />pressing issue since even the campaigns for the<br />2024 election, I believe that the release of<br />ANY file relating to the Epstein investigation<br />will happen before November 25th. However, the<br />more interesting part of the question, and the<br />part that has caused me the most indecision, is<br />whether Congress will pass legislation or not. I<br />think it is very likely that the administration<br />will release at least some less incriminating<br />documents to appease some of the president's more<br />loyal followers, which bypasses the need for any<br />legislation. However, there is the off-chance that<br />a couple of House Republicans decide to change<br />their minds, which could lead to a proposal making<br />it's way to the floor. But, I believe that the<br />off-chance is a very small one, so for that reason<br />I am giving the probability for Congress passing<br />legislation to release the \"Epstein files\" a 33%<br />chance.","Mateo Ceron (4%): I gave this weeks question a<br />4% chance of coming true. Georgia has not had<br />a Category IV hurricane make landfall since<br />1898. Although this hurricane season is expected<br />to be more active than the past couple of<br />years, meteorologists (and a couple of head of<br />departments here at UGA) are confident that even<br />if a hurricane does make landfall here in Georgia,<br />it will not be a Cat. 4.","Nic Curtis (35%): While I think that it is<br />possible for some part of the files to be<br />released, I think it is more likely to not for a<br />few reasons. Trump and Republicans did campaign<br />on the promise to release the files, but have<br />since switched their response, especially Trump.<br />I believe that Trump has too much hold over<br />congressional Republicans to where they will<br />not do something he does not want done. This is<br />evident with speaker Mike Johnson calling for<br />an early recess to stop a vote. Even if a vote<br />does occur, it may take months for congressional<br />committees to look over the files.","Nic Curtis (3%): While many of the briefings<br />suggest that this year could be a more active<br />hurricane season, a Category IV hurricane has<br />not made impact with the state since the 1890s.<br />This, combined with the fact that the shape of<br />Georgia's coastline usually deters Hurricanes from<br />hitting the state head on means that a category<br />V hurricane would need to make landfall in the<br />Florida panhandle in order for it to impact<br />Georgia at a cat IV.","Owen Johnston (20%): Based upon the time<br />constraints it would take for a law to make its<br />way through Congress by November 25th and the lack<br />of support from Republican leadership, including<br />the House Speaker and President Trump, I predict<br />it is unlikely that Congress passes legislation to<br />publicly release the Epstein files before November<br />25th. However, if public pressure continues to<br />be placed on Congress and they can fast track a<br />narrow bill to release some of the files, there<br />is a possibility that Congress could do so before<br />November 25th, however, I believe this is less<br />likely than Congress failing to pass a bill.<br />Because of this, I give a probability of 20% that<br />Congress will pass legislation to publicly release<br />the Epstein files before November 25th.","Owen Johnston (1%): Given the rare historical<br />instances (only two times since the 1890s) and<br />Georgia's geographical advantages which keep<br />it from receiving strong hurricanes, I give a<br />1% probability that a Category IV (or higher)<br />hurricane hits Georgia before November 25.","Paul Frilingos (52%): I'm very unsure about<br />whether this will happen. I can't find anything<br />about congress forcing action by the Justice<br />Department in the past. However, the political<br />pressure to release the Epstein files is very<br />great. Surveys show that 82% of Americans want<br />them to be released. All democrats need is six<br />republicans to join them and I think the pressure<br />might be there. The discharge petition can allow<br />them to get around the House Rules Committee,<br />which the democratic minority has done several<br />times in the past few years against the very slim<br />republican majority. However, there's definitely a<br />question of whether that pressure will still exist<br />when congress returns in september, and whether<br />the files might be released separately from<br />congress.","Paul Frilingos (0%): I don't believe it's<br />possible. Georgia's location, with Florida in the<br />way and the convex coastline, make a hurricane as<br />strong as a category four effectively impossible.<br />It apparently happened once in 1898, which seems<br />to be a fluke. In recent times, when weather data<br />is presumably more reliable, it hasn't come close<br />to occurring. Ultimately, if a category four storm<br />does hit Georgia we may have more things to worry<br />about.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (25%): I think<br />there is a 25% chance that Congress will pass<br />legislation to publicly release the Epstein files<br />before November 25. There is clear bipartisan<br />interest and several active proposals (H.Res.577,<br />H.R.4405, S.2557), but leadership signals are<br />mixed. Other factors working against this are the<br />limited time frame and the complex legal issues<br />involved in document release. Privacy/redaction<br />issues also slow things down.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (3%): I am<br />about 3% confident that a Category IV or higher<br />hurricane could hit Georgia before November 25<br />because history shows it is extremely rare. The<br />last Category IV hurricane to hit Georgia was on<br />1898, almost 127 years ago. A Category 4 hurricane<br />has winds of 130 to 156 mph. The peak of hurricane<br />season combined with very warm Atlantic waters<br />makes powerful storms likely this year, but most<br />major hurricanes usually curve into Florida,<br />the Carolinas, or out to sea instead of striking<br />Georgia. So, when the hurricanes hit Georgia, they<br />are usually a lower category.","Reese Fabritius (17%): Like some of the briefing<br />already covered, this has become an increasingly<br />politicized issue. Because of President Trump's<br />alleged ties to Epstein, I do not think that a<br />Republican controlled House and Senate would vote<br />to release potentially incriminating documents<br />about their party leader. However, public outcries<br />for information may contribute to the release of<br />some, but not all, documents, given that some are<br />under legal protection from release.","Reese Fabritius (4%): Although warmer ocean<br />temperatures and predictions for an active<br />weather season have been made, I do not think<br />that there is any significant chance of a Category<br />4 hurricane hitting Georgia. The last Cat 4<br />to hit Georgia was almost 130 years ago, and I<br />believe our curved coast and strategic geographic<br />positioning behind Florida will continue to<br />protect us.","Ruhi Doddamani (25%): Congress, as an institution,<br />and with the ideological spread that sits its isle<br />now, won't get anything done. We're lucky if any<br />bill gets passed without significant gridlock and<br />legislative tangles. A hot topic like the Epstein<br />Files especially, what with Trump's tie to them,<br />won't get the Republicans to vote with any kind<br />of commitment of support. I didn't forecast a<br />complete 0%, however, because the public is pretty<br />ramped up about this and it's pretty bipartisan,<br />so with adequate pressure, Congress could squeeze<br />something through. Getting it by before November,<br />though?","Ruhi Doddamani (5%): 5%. One, because the last one<br />that has ever managed to maintain that strength<br />all the way to Georgia's coast was back in 1898.<br />Two, if there was a case to be made around global<br />warming and climate conditions changing to make<br />it more likely, the phase of El Niño currents that<br />we're in lowers the chances anyway. A hurricane<br />wouldn't be able to keep up from hitting landfall<br />at Cat V or IV and still being in that range by<br />the time it gets to GA, so the only consideration<br />would be if it strikes on GA's already very<br />limited coastline, and that concave shape<br />already discourages touchdown that isn't past the<br />Florida/S Carolina borders.","Ryan Marx (10%): I believe that there is only a 10<br />percent chance of Congress releasing the Epstein<br />files before November 25th. The first reason for<br />me believing this is because of the stagnation of<br />current legislation to secure the files release.<br />Both the house of representatives(H.res 577) and<br />senate bill 2557 have both requested the immediate<br />release of all documents related to Jeffery<br />Epstein and Ghislane maxwell. However both have<br />stalled in their respective chambers, and with<br />october being the earliest that a new session can<br />be called to push them further the less likely it<br />is that the files will be released in the small<br />window. The other issue effecting this probability<br />is the current political climate within congress,<br />with the upcoming midterm elections in 2026 as<br />well as the political donors and some of the<br />politicians themselves having some connections<br />to Epstein, neither side wishes to give their<br />opposing parties any ammunition to use against<br />them. It is these facts that lead me to believe<br />that there is only around a 10% chance of congress<br />releasing the Epstein files before november 25th.","Ryan Marx (3%): I believe that there is only<br />around a 3 percent chance of a hurricane making<br />landfall in Georgia as a category four. One of<br />the Biggest Reasons for this is that the last<br />time a category 4 or higher hurricane hit Georgia<br />was back in 1896, all subsequent Hurricanes that<br />have made landfall were category 2s and 3s. The<br />closest that any hurricane has came since then<br />is Hurricane Helen in 2024 which hit Florida as<br />a category 4 but died down to a category 2 by the<br />time it Hit Georgia. Furthermore, the reason that<br />so many category 4 hurricanes die down before<br />making landfall in Georgia is because of the<br />states Geography, the trajectory of most of the<br />hurricanes moving up from the Caribbean curve to<br />the north, hitting Florida and losing momentum<br />before making landfall in Georgia, furthermore<br />its coastline bending inwards means that even if<br />the weakened hurricanes make it past Florida, they<br />are most likely to only pass through Georgia's<br />coastal waters. It is with this information that I<br />believe that there is only a 3 percent chance of a<br />category 4 hurricane making landfall in Georgia.","Sade Ezekiel (35%): There is a 35% chance that<br />Congress will pass legislation to publicly<br />release the “Epstein files” before November 25th.<br />Jeffrey Epstein was said to have hung himself<br />while he was in Federal holding. There are many<br />sources that say that Epstein did commit suicide;<br />however, I believe that Jeffrey Epstein did not<br />commit suicide and that he was murdered while<br />in holding. I believe that in the Epstein files,<br />there are high amounts of incriminating evidence<br />against our current president, Donald J Trump. I<br />am very confident that congress will not release<br />these files due to the fact that most of the<br />representatives in congress are Republicans and<br />act in Donald J. Trump's best interest.","Sade Ezekiel (3%): I believe that there is a<br />3% chance that a category IV hurricane will hit<br />Georgia. Many meteorologists say that we will<br />have an above average rain weather season. There<br />hasn't been a category IV hurricane that has hit<br />Georgia in almost 127 years. All of our hurricanes<br />in the past have come from beneath us in Florida,<br />and when the hurricane collected in Georgia the<br />category decreased due to the land and hills. We<br />also have a curved coastline, so the probability<br />of a category IV hurricane hitting Georgia is very<br />low.","Sarah Kate Maher (25%): Congress is out of session<br />until September. And the House Oversight Committee<br />still needs to go through thousands of pages<br />of the files and then reach a vote on releasing<br />the files. Even then, the DOJ hasn't given the<br />Oversight Committee all of the documents yet.<br />If the committee somehow got through all of the<br />files, and it was up to Congress to vote, it would<br />probably not pass, as some members of Congress<br />have hinted at opposition to releasing the files.","Sarah Kate Maher (15%): The last time a Category<br />4 hurricane hit Georgia was in 1898. In order for<br />a Category 4 hurricane to hit Georgia, it would<br />have to defy the historical pattern of hurricanes<br />first hitting Florida or another close area and<br />then moving up to Georgia. And with that pattern,<br />hurricanes lose a lot of their power after making<br />landfall in a neighboring state, lessening them to<br />a tropical storm or a lower category hurricane. By<br />the time one of these storms would hit Georgia (if<br />they even did due to the curve of the coastline),<br />they would not be at the strength of a Category 4<br />storm.","Sasha Mahtani (16%): Based on the parameters of<br />the question specifying whether Congress pass the<br />legislation, I gave a relatively low probability<br />that the process of releasing the Epstein files<br />will happen so soon. As we discussed in class, the<br />House or Representatives and Senate remain largely<br />republican. If we look at this as a party issue,<br />one can argue that the files have a low chance<br />of being released by Congress, as republicans<br />voted against the motion of releasing the files.<br />November 25th is only three months away, which<br />is a notably short period of time in terms of<br />Congress passing legislation.","Sasha Mahtani (40%): Hurricane Ferdinand is<br />currently being tracked for moving eastward,<br />so away from Georgia which leads me to believe<br />there is a lower chance that a hurricane will hit<br />us before November 25th. According to CBS news,<br />Ferdinand is expected to move across open waters<br />of the subtropical Atlantic ocean. While Georgia<br />may have a higher probability of having tropical<br />storms or even lower category hurricanes, I think<br />its safe to say that there is a less than 50<br />percent probability of a category IV (or higher)<br />hurricane will hit Georgia.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (12%): A vote already took place<br />in July 2025 in Congress on whether the Trump<br />administration should be ordered to release the<br />\"Epstein files\". 211 votes against the release,<br />all Republican, against the 210 for it, made it<br />crystal clear this is a party issue. As long as<br />Republicans are in the majority for the House of<br />Representatives and the Senate, and likely no one<br />stands to lose more from a release of the Epstein<br />files than Donald Trump, we may not see a release<br />of the Epstein files as long as Trump is president<br />and the Republican party controls Congress.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (1%): There is virtually no<br />chance that this is the year a Category IV or<br />higher hurricane will make landfall in Georgia.<br />The last time this happened was over 120 years<br />ago, and no significant changes have occurred to<br />make this year any different. Hurricanes rarely<br />make landfall in Georgia at all, and the ones<br />that do weaken to Category 2 or 3. This is due<br />to the curvature of Georgia’s coast, its smaller<br />coastline, and the transition to land that<br />naturally weakens hurricanes as the warm water is<br />key to the storm’s strength.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (3%): I selected 3% to<br />reflect the extreme rarity of a Category 4<br />or higher hurricane making direct landfall in<br />Georgia, a fact supported by a limited historical<br />record. While the 2025 season is predicted<br />to be \"above normal\" due to factors like very<br />warm Atlantic waters and an active West African<br />Monsoon, this does not translate to a higher<br />probability of a specific Georgia landfall. The<br />season's ENSO-neutral state means neither El<br />Niño's suppressing nor La Niña's enhancing effects<br />are a factor. The state's barrier islands also<br />provide a natural buffer, and the overall track of<br />storms is highly unpredictable. Therefore, while<br />the Atlantic basin may be active, I anticipate<br />Georgia's coast will remain a low-probability<br />target.","Zafar Ali (15%): Based on the current Trump<br />administration, there is a very low chance that<br />there will much action when it comes to releasing<br />anything regarding the Epstein files. Currently,<br />Congress is in recess and even if anything were<br />to come out now, there is already enough suspicion<br />that proves as evidence for those who believe<br />Donald Trump is guilty of wrongdoing in relation<br />to his long relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.<br />There are also Trump's longtime supporters who<br />will stand by him regardless of the information<br />brought out. Because of this, there probably is<br />not much of a reason for many to want to have<br />these files released to the public. Some in the<br />Republican party have called for action to be made<br />for transparency, but it is likely that nothing<br />much if anything at all will happen from now to<br />November 25th since that seems to be too short<br />of a time frame. I also put 15% for the reason<br />that it is not relying on everything to come out<br />but at least something so that pushes the chances<br />slightly further to more possible than not.","Zafar Ali (1%): For this forecast, it is very<br />unlikely to see a major hurricane in Georgia. The<br />last category 4 hurricane that made landfall in<br />Georgia occurred in 1898 which shows that there<br />is a small probability of any major threats. Many<br />hurricanes also tend to curve in a way that forces<br />them to move through Florida or other areas first<br />so by the time they reach Georgia, there is little<br />to no impact."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.25,0.040000000000000001],"y":[1.9818765400676057,1.0224715343210846],"text":["Crowd (25%)","Crowd (4%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.080000000000000002,0.050000000000000003],"y":[2.0272750765783711,1.0162081830902026],"text":["Joe Ornstein (8%): As first approximation, if the<br />question is \"will Congress pass X legislation?\"<br />the answer is almost always no.

Out of 134 discharge petitions filed<br />this century, only *two* have led to a bill being<br />passed without the Speaker's support. That's a<br />base rate of 1.5% for this sort of thing. Given<br />the ongoing salience of the issue, I'm going to<br />generously multiply that base rate by a factor of<br />five.","Joe Ornstein (5%): Over the past 20 hurricane<br />seasons, there have been six years when a<br />Cat IV storm hit the mainland US. In two<br />of those cases--Helene (2024) & Michael<br />(2018)---the hurricane crossed into Georgia<br />as a significantly-dissipated Cat II. We are<br />geographically-blessed with a short, convex<br />coastline buffered by a much longer state to the<br />south.

Not only<br />has the war been going on for a long time now, but<br />neither side has shown signs of 'backing down'.<br />Putin continues to wage a war on Ukraine, despite<br />the tariffs on oil and other products being placed<br />on the country. Furthermore, I think neither state<br />sees a gain/benefit in a ceasefire and pushing<br />for peace, and consider the continuous fighting<br />to be more beneficial or impactful for their<br />individual countries. After switching from placing<br />embargos to now embracing Putin's plan, Trump's<br />added support only fuels the fire that keeps<br />the war going. Other than the past and recent<br />current events that've occurred surrounding the<br />Russia-Ukraine conflict, predicting a potential<br />solution to happen by November for something that<br />has been going on for years just seems highly<br />improbable.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (75%): Based on the criteria<br />for a television series to win awards for<br />outstanding drama series along with the popularity<br />of the series within in media, severence presents<br />a significantly good chance of winning the<br />Outstanding series. Additionally the series has<br />a impressive amount of nominations for various<br />aspects of the series, typically series that have<br />had the same amount of nomincations for various<br />categories tend to win the main awards such<br />as outstanding series such as Game of Thrones.<br />Although the series has good competition such as<br />The Pitt, Severence has served to be an academy<br />favorite which poses a great chance for the series<br />to win the Outstanding series award.","Alizah Mudaliar (17%): It is unlikely that Russia<br />and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire. There have<br />been previous talks for a ceasefire that have not<br />been successful. Given that Ukraine demands Russia<br />fully withdraw their troops and Russia wants<br />more territory, neither country will come to an<br />agreement in the next 3 months for a long-lasting<br />ceasefire. If there is a ceasefire, it will likely<br />be broken soon after due to conflicting interests.","Alizah Mudaliar (68%): I believe there is a<br />68% chance of Severance winning the Emmy for<br />Outstanding Drama Series for three reasons:<br />historical trends, industry momentum, and<br />competition. The show has 27 total Emmy<br />nominations and 10 major nominations. Typically,<br />shows that earn the most Emmy nominations are<br />awarded Outstanding Drama Series including Game<br />of Thrones, Succession, The Crown, and Shōgun.<br />Television Academy also views Severance as one<br />of the most significant dramas streaming today.<br />There is competition for the award from shows<br />like The Pitt, The Last of Us, and Andor; however,<br />Severance has support across the board for its<br />cinematography, character acting, and technical<br />areas. There is unpredictability in the voting<br />process for the Emmy awards, creating uncertainty<br />of who will win, which lowers the odds of<br />Severance winning the award.","Amanda Neighbour (15%): Ceasefires take both sides<br />to work, and unfortunately neither sides have<br />shown any signs of compromise. Battlefields are<br />not slowing down, which indicate no ceasefire in<br />the near future. With only a few months left of<br />the year, it appears to be unlikely a ceasefire<br />will occur. The most pressure was applied after<br />Trump's election, claiming he would end the war<br />in 100 days, however, this movement did not occur.<br />Russia's reasons for invading Ukraine are still<br />the same--wanting to return land back to the<br />homeland--and Ukraine is not willing. Th leaders<br />have not met since 2019, and the President of<br />Turkey claimed they are not near a sit down point.<br />Just four days ago, Russia attacked Ukraine’s<br />Zaporizhia and Kyiv hits Russian oil refineries.","Amanda Neighbour (70%): Sitting at 27 nominations,<br />Severance stands a pretty solid chance of winning<br />the Outstanding Drama Emmy. Historically, the<br />highest amount of nominations usually correlates<br />with winning the Emmy. The other plausible<br />competition predicted by experts is The Pitt,<br />however, this show has half as many nominations<br />and is only one season. Severance has been<br />nominated before, but as the show has evolved<br />through more seasons, it has a higher chance of<br />winning. Severance has a lot of buzz surrounding<br />the shows, and this is something I observed as I<br />has not heard any raving reviews or talks about<br />its competitions. However, it is an Apple TV<br />series, which may make it as popular as series<br />from Netflix or other platforms. The show itself,<br />being a sci-fi/thriller series is culturally<br />relevant and unique through its demonstration of<br />becoming intertwined with technology. This may<br />stick out to the voters more than a show such<br />as The Pitt would, since there are many hospital<br />drama series in existence.","Ana Valencia (8%): It is highly improbable that<br />Russia and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire<br />before November 25, 2025. Russia insists on<br />maximalist demands, such as Ukraine ceding the<br />Donbas and abandoning NATO ambitions, while<br />Ukraine refuses any concessions that undermine<br />sovereignty or security. Forecasting models like<br />RAND place the probability of a 2025 ceasefire at<br />only 11%, especially considering on a ceasefire<br />that may only satisfy one side over the other,<br />which means the probability will also decrease<br />based on those scenarios.","Anna Barton-Caucci (20%): I think it is unlikely<br />that there will be a ceasefire between Russia and<br />Ukraine before the end of November because Ukraine<br />and Russia have completely different wants and<br />they have consistently been at odds for a while.<br />They are both resistant to even having a civil<br />conversation at the moment which makes it unlikely<br />that they could formally agree upon a ceasefire<br />agreement. There are also not a lot of domestic<br />incentives or pushes to end the war right now on<br />both sides.","Anna Barton-Caucci (70%): I think because<br />severance has 27 nominations it has a high chance<br />of winning. The main runner up, The Pitt, only<br />has 13 nominations and in general when series<br />are nominated more, they have a higher chance<br />of winning in their categories. I didn't put<br />the probability any higher because Ben Stiller,<br />the director has not had a strong history of<br />award-winning, but I do believe this series in<br />general is doing well and better than his others.","Anna Kneser (15%): Ultimately, Russia's demands<br />remain \"unchanged\" and there is no foreseeable<br />change in their stance. There are still active<br />operations and pressure on multiple fronts, so<br />I highly doubt that the violence will slow down<br />before November 25th because there has been too<br />much bad blood between the two countries for too<br />long of a time. Additionally, Trump's position has<br />changed after a meeting with Putin, now advocating<br />for an end to the war instead of just a ceasefire.<br />Ending the war will ultimately take longer if<br />this is the main focus now. If anything, I can<br />potentially see a temporary ceasefire during the<br />holidays in December, but that is outside of the<br />scope that we are predicting.","Anna Kneser (70%): Severance has 27 nominations,<br />which shows how widespread its recognition<br />is. Historically, any drama series that have<br />been nominated that much has never lost. More<br />specifically, the show with the highest number<br />of nominations has won Best Drama Series 9 years<br />out of 10. In contrast, Severence's competition,<br />The Pitt, has only received 13 nominations. The<br />website GoldDerby says that The Pitt only has a<br />30% chance of winning as well. However, The Pitt<br />was very emotional, so some voters may have an<br />emotional resonance with this series. That is<br />where this 30% comes from. Ultimately, though, I<br />think Severance has a high chance of winning due<br />to its growing buzz, originality, and amount of<br />nominations it has received.","Arshia Charkhian (8%): Russia and Ukraine are<br />unlikely to agree on a ceasefire agreement if<br />it seems like a short-term solution, and both<br />countries' interests are still completely at odds.<br />The odds are higher with Trump in office, as he<br />ran his campaign on creating peace swiftly and<br />would be more inclined to give Ukraine a losing<br />hand to achieve that. But given the November 25<br />date, it is unlikely for agreements to happen this<br />quickly.","Arshia Charkhian (90%): Given Severence’s high<br />cultural relevance and 27 nominations, I give<br />it a 90% chance that it will win an Emmy for<br />Outstanding Drama Series. The high number of<br />nominations indicates wide-scale support amongst<br />voters, and the lack of a super high-profile<br />competitor makes it very likely to win.","Blake Martin (25%): I said there was a 25% chance<br />that there will be an agreed upon ceasefire<br />because both sides remain deeply divided on core<br />demands, with little trust and no framework that's<br />credible for a resolution. Past ceasefires have<br />fallen apart and neither side feels much pressure<br />to stop fighting right now. Talks have happened,<br />but nothing serious or concrete has happened<br />from them yet. So while it is not impossible,<br />especially because of recent talks world leaders<br />have had, a deal in the next few months is highly<br />unlikely.","Blake Martin (68%): I say there is a 68% chance<br />of Severance winning because it has wide success<br />across its two seasons and there was a lot of<br />praise for the new season from critics. The<br />biggest competitor is known to be The Pit but<br />shows that are one season usually have a harder<br />time winning any awards. It also has only had<br />half as many nominations as the Severance. The<br />White Lotus was also possibly a competitor but<br />the momentum of the show and its viewership have<br />declines. However, I am not completely confident<br />because I wouldn't be surprised if things come<br />out and shock us because the awards are subject to<br />academy members and what they vote for.","Breanne Talley (15%): The core reason I don’t<br />think we’ll get that by late November is that<br />the politics, battlefield behavior, and mediation<br />signals all point away from a deal on this short<br />timeline. Publicly, the Kremlin still couples any<br />halt in fighting to outcomes Kyiv can’t accept,<br />withdrawal from regions Russia claims, and limits<br />on Ukraine’s future security alignment. Reuters’<br />mid-August coverage flatly said Moscow’s demands<br />were “unchanged,” and subsequent reporting<br />described a package that includes renouncing NATO<br />and keeping Western troops out, conditions that<br />Kyiv has repeatedly rejected. That’s not a “split<br />the difference in a few weeks” gap; it’s two<br />incompatible stories about how the war should end.","Breanne Talley (70%): Based on historical data,<br />shows with the most nominations typically win the<br />award for Outstanding Drama Series; Severance has<br />27 Emmy Nominations. There is one notable outlier<br />in this data when The Handmaid's Tale won. Other<br />prediction markets are putting it around 65%. So<br />I feel like with trend analysis and the way others<br />are thinking that it is probable that it will win<br />the Emmy award.","Caleb Lux (15%): There is no real incentive for<br />either Russia or Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire<br />in the next three months. Ukraine is not pressed<br />for resources, even as US support wanes, due to<br />the commitment of other G7 nations. Russia has<br />not achieved its goals, falling short on its<br />territorial expansion. Without any indication<br />of further peacemaking, it is only reasonable<br />to assume the status quo: the raging war for the<br />past 3.5 years will continue on. It is possible<br />a temporary ceasefire could occur, but I find it<br />unlikely.","Caleb Lux (71%): Based entirely outside of my<br />prior knowledge, there seems to be a pretty<br />good chance that Severance will win this Emmy.<br />Averaging the probabilities that the discussion<br />leaders gave in their briefings, I got 71%,<br />and this seems pretty reasonable. I want to be<br />fairly cautious due to this question being well<br />outside my expertise, so I will rely on other's<br />assessments.","Caroline Mattox (25%): There is a lot of pressure<br />from outside parties to end the war but I'm not<br />sure that either of these countries are truly<br />working towards a ceasefire. Negotiations between<br />these countries are not even close to complete<br />or at a point where a ceasefire could even be<br />possible. These two countries have just shown no<br />desire to truly work together to make a ceasefire<br />happen so I do not see a ceasefire happening<br />before November 25th.","Caroline Mattox (80%): Severance has some strong<br />competition like The Pitt for example but I think<br />there is a very high chance that Severance will<br />win the Emmy for this category. This show has<br />received a lot of recognition since releasing the<br />latest season. Severance is a very origianl show<br />that definitely fits under this category well and<br />i could definitely see it taking home the Emmy for<br />this category.","Chris Haswell (10%): Neither Ukraine nor Russia<br />appears to want a ceasefire, as both sides see<br />the other's demands as unacceptable. Ukraine<br />is not yet broken, and they appear to be able<br />to withstand another three months of war.<br />Russia seems content to continue making meager<br />territorial gains, and they have no reason to<br />demand anything less than Donbas, which Ukraine<br />is simply unwilling to give up. I don't think that<br />President Trump has the power to force both sides<br />to the table, and his recent summits with both<br />Putin and Europe indicate a continuation of the<br />status quo.","Chris Haswell (65%): I am fairly confident that<br />Severance will win the emmy, but I do not think<br />its a shoe in. I am encouraged by the statistic<br />that historically the show with the most<br />nominations wins Outstanding Drama, but I do think<br />Andor is a more culturally relevant show. The fact<br />that Andor ended this year while Severance will<br />continue also increases its chances of winning the<br />emmy this year. While Severance has better odds of<br />winning than the other contenders, I would not be<br />shocked if it does not win.","Cierra Green (15%): It is unlikely that Russia<br />and Ukraine will reach an agreement by November<br />25th. Although Ukraine is willing to make an<br />agreement, there is little incentive for Russia<br />to ceasefire. Ukraine and Russia must also agree<br />on the terms of the ceasefire itself. This takes<br />communication, time, and negotiation to come to a<br />conclusion: a goal which is difficult to achieve<br />in such little time. Additionally, looking at<br />Polymarket (as of 9/2), the prediction is 19% that<br />Ukraine and Russia will ceasefire by the end of<br />2025. Meaning a ceasefire is unlikely. Since this<br />question puts the deadline about a month earlier,<br />the likelihood for November 25th will be lower.<br />Using another political forecasting website, RAND<br />(as of 9/2), 90% of voters believe there will<br />not be a ceasefire agreement before 2026. Using<br />this reasoning and a middle ground between both<br />forecasting websites, I believe there is a 15%<br />chance there will be a ceasefire agreement.","Cierra Green (75%): When viewing the history<br />of winners for Outstanding Drama Series, these<br />titles typically had the most nominations. With<br />27 nominations, Severance is more likely than<br />not to win this award. Additionally, the second<br />most likely title to win is The Pitt with 13<br />nominations. Having more than double the amount,<br />Severance is more likely to win based on the<br />Emmy's track record. However, this does not<br />guarantee that Severance will win. In 2017, the<br />title with the most nominations did not win.<br />Therefore, it is not impossible for Severance to<br />lose. Since the Emmy's are based on the views of<br />some judges, there is more room for subjectivity<br />and inconsistency. This may be the year they<br />deviate from the norm again; or they may continue<br />giving the award to the title with the most<br />nominations.","Elizabeth Nelson (15%): I believe because of the<br />short time-line and because it seems that the war<br />is not cooling down any time soon, I believe it is<br />pretty unlikely that Russia and Ukraine will agree<br />to a ceasefire before November 25th. I think it<br />is especially insightful to note that the mediator<br />is not ready to make a comment yet. I don't think<br />that the chances are quite zero just because there<br />are obviously certain circumstances that could<br />make a ceasefire the only option, but I don't<br />think the odds are in a ceasefires' favor.","Elizabeth Nelson (80%): Considering how many<br />nominations Severance has, acting, writing, and<br />directing (10 Major Nominations) which is tied<br />with White Lotus, since 2019, nine out of ten<br />times, shows with the most nominations tend to win<br />most outstanding. The Handmaid's Tale was the only<br />outlier within the last ten years. I think because<br />Severance has more nominations and because they<br />are not just from \"supporting actors\" like white<br />lotus' majority of nominations. In the context<br />of the competition and the history of the Emmy's,<br />I think Severance has a pretty good chance at<br />winning the Emmy Award.","Ellie Null (15%): I am very skeptical that there<br />will be a ceasefire before November 25th 2025. For<br />one, after reading these briefs and doing my own<br />outside research I find that there is less than<br />a 20% chance of a ceasefire. Considering the fact<br />they are not slowing down or showing any signs of<br />compromise. They both want different things and<br />have been consistent on their views and on the<br />battlefield. Furthermore, there might be a little<br />input from Donald Trump meaning that he could<br />put pressure on both sides but I don't know how<br />helpful that truly will be. I think overall that<br />there is not a high chance at all to a ceasefire<br />because there are so many moving parts and demands<br />from each side. These two leaders have not met in<br />person in a while so i dont think they are ready<br />to broker a deal.","Francesca Mariano (70%): One of the strongest<br />pieces of evidence to me is the fact that shows<br />with the most Emmy Nominations win the Emmy<br />for outstanding dramas (Handmaid's Tales is<br />the only exception). With Severance having 27<br />overall nominations, this places them as the most<br />nominated. One brief writer brought up the fact<br />that none of the nominations are for acting, and<br />other nominees have a wider range of nominations,<br />raising possible doubts about Severance winning.<br />Many brought up The Pitt as a primary contender,<br />and despite knowing that I shouldn't be basing<br />my forecasts solely on my perception, I have<br />personally not heard any buzz about this show, and<br />I would consider myself very online and tuned in<br />to new media. Probabilities in the briefs range<br />from 68%-88%. Given that Severance is so highly<br />rated, receives a lot of public buzz, and is the<br />most Emmy-nominated, I am confident saying that<br />it is the likely winner. With there being fierce<br />competition and no way to truly gauge what the<br />Television Academy is thinking, there is always a<br />chance for a different show to be selected winner,<br />which leads me to believe the probability of<br />Severance winning is 70%.","Ellie Null (69%): I predict that there is a 69%<br />chance that Severance will win the Emmy Award<br />for Outstanding Drama Series. I have come to<br />the conclusion because severance has 10 major<br />nominations and 4 minor or arts nominations. Those<br />with a lot of nominations or the most nominations<br />have notoriously won Best Drama. However, the<br />runner up in this competition is The Pitts. I<br />have lowered my prediction because of this film,<br />it has a strong subject matter, social relevance<br />and a strong ensemble. It is considered a major<br />contender for this Award. News outlets are<br />placing this series in the “should” or “could” win<br />category. These two shows have individually stood<br />above the rest. They have generated much more<br />critical acclaim and audience engagement too. But<br />again The Pitts has half the nominations compared<br />to Severance. Other contenders like Andor and The<br />White Lotus bring strong cinematic techniques and<br />have emotional plotlines, however their momentum<br />is weaker compared to Severance and The Pitt. In<br />the end, I am fairly confident that there is a<br />strong chane of it winning, but I would not be too<br />surprised if The Pitts ends up being the winner.","Hunter Murray (13%): The only reason I have this<br />over 10% is because I believe the \"Trump\" factor<br />could increase the likelihood of a ceasefire<br />(possibly over 15%). But his current workload<br />(distractions from foreign policy) and questions<br />about his health lower my prediction to a slim<br />13%.","Hunter Murray (79%): While some of my classmates<br />were more confident, I took a more cautious route.<br />I think that the there is a level of volitivity<br />that is being ignored (while history of voting and<br />numbers of nominations are being over-emphasized).<br />I also got some help from my film major friends<br />who are out in California, and the overall<br />consensus was that Severance was \"very likely\"<br />(8/10 with the marbles test) to win.","Jack Lutz (18%): The fighting within Ukraine still<br />continues, with Russian missiles still striking<br />Ukrainian civilians, and Ukranian drones still<br />blowing the tops off of Russian tanks. Neither<br />side is currently willing to even sit down to<br />talk, let alone talk about any form of ceasefire.<br />However, President Trump is still trying to find<br />a solution to get both sides to back off and<br />accept peace, so it remains possible. However, the<br />disadvantage a ceasefire would currently give both<br />sides, along with neither side being happy with<br />potential peace resolutions makes this an unlikely<br />occurrence.","Jackson Bost (17%): The only point in the war<br />where a ceasefire was attempted was Easter, a<br />move that was widely viewed as a stunt meant to<br />shift blame onto Ukraine. That move, though, came<br />near the beginning of Trump's second term, making<br />it an opportune moment for Putin to test Trump's<br />response. At this point in the war, however,<br />there is no reason for Putin to test or entertain<br />a ceasefire. The war is supported by 75% of<br />the population, US sanctions and aid constantly<br />flipflop, and while not ideal, the humanitarian<br />situation hasn't drawn attention like Gaza, making<br />a ceasefire unlikely.","Jackson Bost (68%): Severance has a strong<br />chance of winning given some of the historical<br />indicators we have discussed. It currently holds<br />the highest number of nominations across a broad<br />array of categories, making it hard to compete<br />with according to the Emmy's voting guidelines.<br />Its two main sources of competition, The Pitt and<br />The White Lotus, make fair cases but ultimately<br />fall short. In the history of this award, a one<br />season show has only won 15 times, six of those<br />being from 2000 on, giving The Pitt poorer odds.<br />The White Lotus also makes a strong case, but the<br />last time it lost was to Succession, a show that<br />mirrors Severance in its number of nominations and<br />acclaim.","James Hunter Darke (70%): I believe that severance<br />will win the emmy for outstanding drama series.<br />Now this might be a little biased as I have seen<br />the show and it's awesome, but a lot of factors<br />point towards the win. It has the most nominations<br />of any show, and most of the time that show<br />wins. Secondly, while the competition is good,<br />Severance blows these shows out of the water.<br />For a long time the \"innie\" \"outtie\" component of<br />severance was a large social media topic with many<br />discussing their own innies and outties. I fully<br />believe that this show will win the emmy.","Jhaycee Barnes (20%): Russia has ruled out a<br />stand-alone ceasefire, and Ukraine has rejected<br />proposals like buffer zones, showing both sides<br />remain firm in their positions. The continued<br />strikes show neither side sees value in stopping<br />the war, and both know the other would use any<br />pause to regroup their military.","Jhaycee Barnes (60%): Severance has become one<br />of the most talked-about shows heading into the<br />Emmys. Critics talk about its creativity and<br />originality compared to other nominees, and the<br />momentum it’s carried since its first season<br />hasn’t slowed down. All of this makes it a strong<br />favorite in the drama category.","Kira Fleischer (13%): Neither country has shown<br />any promising mediation signals, especially<br />considering the lack of communication and<br />willingness to communicate from both presidents.<br />There is also no meaningful pressure in Ukraine<br />or Russia from their citizens for a ceasefire,<br />considering the fact that it would allow the<br />other side to regroup and strengthen. The war<br />has been going on for so long, and I do not see<br />any convincing hints of it ending in the next 3<br />months.","Kira Fleischer (84%): Emmy history reveals<br />a direct correlation between the number of<br />nominations received and chances of winning<br />an award. \"Severance\" received a whopping 27<br />nominations, earning its place as the nominations<br />leader by a significant amount. Its greatest<br />competition, \"The Pitt,\" is not predicted as<br />a winner by many journalists, and voters have<br />incentive to reward \"Severance\" considering the<br />defeat its first season faced during the last<br />award ceremony.","Kristoffer Fields (10%): I find it highly unlikely<br />that they will come to a ceasefire given the<br />current sociopolitical climate of that region.<br />This has also been ongoing conflict and despite<br />peace talks nothing has come to play. Furthermore,<br />they are several other humanitarian crisis going<br />on around the world and the United Nations has not<br />done much about. The only possible reason a cease<br />fire make come would be due to external interest<br />in the region from a foreign authority, in<br />essence, Ukraine does not stand a chance to Russia<br />unfortuanetly.","Kristoffer Fields (82%): Severance is a critically<br />acclaimed show and has several nominations.<br />Furthermore most of our briefings point towards<br />high probability of it winning something,<br />it has a creative and unique plot line which<br />attracts people from all genres. It also has 27<br />nominations.","Liz Yancey (15%): Based on what was said in class<br />today and in the briefings, the consensus was<br />that there would not be a ceasefire between these<br />two states. I agree with this assertion primarily<br />because neither state has any interest in ending<br />the war. There is too much to lose/gain for either<br />side if fighting stopped, even for a limited<br />time. During the ceasefire period, both sides<br />would most likely build up their arms and resume<br />fighting, making the conflict even worse than<br />before. Ukraine also has immense support from the<br />international community, which further fuels its<br />fighting and incentivizes it to continue.","Liz Yancey (65%): I thought everyone's points from<br />class today were interesting. I already thought<br />Severance would win because I heard so much buzz<br />about it. Honestly, the only show I've seen that's<br />nominated is White Lotus, and I wasn't even that<br />interested in finishing the newest season. I only<br />watched because I enjoyed the prior seasons, and<br />was interested to see how southern families were<br />represented in modern media. I think Severance<br />is interesting, and I thought the point about<br />how many Emmys they're nominated for and what<br />categories those nominations are in could be a<br />great indicator of whether they win this major<br />category. There's still unpredictability, but<br />overall, I think they have a good chance of<br />winning.","Mateo Ceron (15%): As of right now, I believe that<br />a ceasefire is unlikely. Neither party is wanting<br />a ceasefire (which is kind of the main part of<br />a successful ceasefire) and neither Ukraine nor<br />Russia is wanting to cede without adding their<br />own special requests to an agreement. Putin wants<br />to limit Ukraine's military and obviously Ukraine<br />is not going to agree to terms that leave them<br />worse off than they were when the war started.<br />We also have the Trump administration to think<br />about however, because they do have the ability<br />to attempt to strong arm the states into an<br />agreement. However, we've seen his meeting with<br />Putin at the Alaska summit, which sort of pushed<br />the ball towards no ceasefire or treaty (due to<br />the terms Putin presented).","Mateo Ceron (70%): In considering the Emmy<br />process, its criteria, and the competition,<br />Severance appears to have a stronger-than-usual<br />chance of taking home the award for “Outstanding<br />Drama Series.” Its 27 nominations demonstrate<br />broad recognition across nearly every branch of<br />the Television Academy, signaling both artistic<br />and technical respect. Combined with its cultural<br />relevance, timely themes, and critical acclaim,<br />the show has the momentum it lacked in its<br />first season. While contenders like The Pitt<br />and The White Lotus offer real competition, the<br />combination of industry support, originality,<br />and growing buzz makes me believe that Severance<br />has a 70% chance of winning the Emmy award for<br />“Outstanding Drama Series”.","Nic Curtis (15%): I find the likelihood of Russia<br />and Ukraine agreeing to a ceasefire before the<br />end of the semester very unlikely for multiple<br />reasons. For one, Putin and Zelenskyy's terms for<br />a ceasefire are completely different. Putin wants<br />more land than they have control of right now in<br />Ukraine while Zelenskyy is unwilling to succeed<br />any territory. Outside actors have also expressed<br />that the two leaders are still unwilling to sit<br />down with each other a talk. Zelenskyy has no<br />incentive to trust Putin as well. President Trump<br />has also favored a peace deal over a ceasefire,<br />expressing his belief that ceasefires do not<br />work. Other forecasters and markets predict the<br />likelihood of a ceasefire before the end of the<br />year as being slim. There is some precedent of<br />fighting stopping, like the 30 hour fighting hold,<br />but this is not enough to convince me.","Nic Curtis (65%): I think severance has a very<br />decent chance at winning the Emmy award for<br />Outstanding Drama series for a few reasons. For<br />one, over the past decade, the tv show with the<br />most Emmy nominations won. the Outstanding Drama<br />series 9 out 10 of the years. Furthermore, those<br />who are in writers in the field, such as Gold<br />Derby Surveying, give the chance of Severance<br />earning the award between a 60-70% chance. Stiff<br />competition from the Pitt and Andor may split the<br />vote, but these series lack other nominations in<br />acting which is part of the criteria in nomination<br />for this specific award.","Owen Johnston (10%): Based upon the lack of<br />geopolitical indictors that historically indicate<br />a ceasefire will be reached, combined with<br />polymarket's all-time low probability of 20%, and<br />the RAND forecast being at 11% for a ceasefire<br />being reached before the end of the year, I give<br />a 10% chance accounting for the earlier date of<br />November 25th.","Paul Frilingos (74%): This was the conclusion<br />I reached in my briefing, and I’m sticking with<br />it. I’m a little more confident than the experts<br />at GoldDerby who are at 70% because I think<br />the history just shows that severance’s many<br />nominations make it strong favorite. I’m not going<br />to go higher because there is always the chance of<br />an upset, as occurred in 2017 with the handmaid’s<br />tale, but I’m fairly confident.","Paul Frilingos (20%): This isn't the most precise<br />prediction. This war has been going on for some<br />time now, and the only major change recently<br />has been Donald Trump becoming president of the<br />united states again. Trump's most recent position<br />on the war has been against a ceasefire in favor<br />of a peace deal, however a peace deal seem very<br />unlikely given what both sides want. However, the<br />war of attrition could always let up, which is why<br />I can't bring myself to go lower than 20%.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (15%): With talks<br />stalled, Russia’s hardline demands, Trump leaning<br />toward Moscow, and Ukraine insisting on security<br />guarantees, a ceasefire before November 25 looks<br />unlikely. War fatigue is growing, but heavy<br />fighting and deep mistrust make progress slim. In<br />light of these dynamics, my forecast is that there<br />is only about a 15% probability of a ceasefire<br />being reached before November 25.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (73%): Severance<br />leads all shows with 27 total nominations, tying<br />for the second most total nominations for a drama<br />series of all time. The show’s themes of identity<br />and corporate power also feel timely and resonate<br />with voters. The Pitt and The White Lotus poses<br />a threat to Severance’s chances. But, combined<br />with its cultural relevance, timely themes, and<br />critical acclaim, the Severance has the momentum<br />it lacked in its first season. Therefore, I would<br />say Severance has about a 73% chance of winning<br />Outstanding Drama Series.","Reese Fabritius (16%): As I mentioned in my<br />briefing, I just think that these two countries<br />want such different outcomes that there is just<br />not enough time before this deadline for their<br />objectives to change. However, with American<br />pressure, it may be slightly more possible that<br />they will be pushed from external factors.","Reese Fabritius (80%): After reading some of<br />the briefings, I think severance has a very good<br />chance of winning the Emmy. It has generated a<br />lot of buzz and I just don’t think that there is<br />another series that would take its spot. Severance<br />has done better in the media and I believe will<br />continue on its run as the most highly regarded<br />drama.","Ruhi Doddamani (10%): Considering the opposing<br />motives of both Russia and Ukraine, what<br />historically signals a ceasefire, what Europe is<br />doing, as well as recent presidential actions,<br />steps have only taken us backwards in reaching<br />greater security for Ukraine. In international<br />affairs, ceasefires are frequently observed to<br />follow conditions seeming like a mutual military<br />stalemate, followed by significant humanitarian<br />crises and intense diplomatic pressure.<br />Additionally, it is common for negotiating parties<br />to escalate military actions immediately before or<br />during talks, strategically vying for a stronger<br />position, a dynamic often termed \"fighting to the<br />finish.\" While civilian casualties still run high<br />in Ukraine, interviews before and after any of<br />President Zelensky’s summits with citizens in Kyiv<br />show them supportive and patriotic, rallied behind<br />much of what their administration is doing. Russia<br />remains relatively unperturbed by American tariffs<br />on oil and other products.","Ruhi Doddamani (67%): The uncertainty comes from<br />the Academy's proclivity to snub really good<br />shows. Most variables point in Severance's favor,<br />but I just met a few people who had never heard of<br />the show, when I'd previously though it was like<br />the Game of Thrones of the year, so I'll temper<br />the prediction.","Ryan Marx (10%): I believe there to be only a<br />10% chance of Russia and Ukraine agreeing to<br />a ceasefire by November 25th. My first bit of<br />reasoning is that with over 300,000 soldiers<br />killed in Ukraine, Putin is very unlikely<br />to commit to any sort ceasefire in Ukraine<br />without any sort of territorial or political<br />concessions, despite the fact that Ukrainian<br />president Volodymyr Zelensky has made a point of<br />stating that Ukraine will concede no territory<br />or political power as conditions for a ceasefire.<br />Furthermore, Russia has continued to Launch<br />offensives into new Regions and has continued<br />its ongoing aerial assaults, not only does the<br />logistics behind such an operation make it so<br />that the first days of said offensives will run<br />dangerously close to the november deadline, but<br />with these operations comes a bolstered opinion<br />of Moscow's perception of military advantage and<br />only serves to further reduce any motivation for<br />compromise. Therefore it is safe to assume there<br />is only a 10 percent chance of a ceasefire by<br />november 25th.","Ryan Marx (65%): I believe that there is<br />approximately a 65% chance that Severance will<br />win the Emmy Award for outstanding drama series<br />for a number of reasons. The first reason is<br />that Severance alone is leading the award show<br />with 27 nominations across both major and minor<br />categories, the most out of any show this year<br />including Outstanding drama series, outstanding<br />Lead actor/Actress, and outstanding Supporting<br />actor/actress. While the second most nominated<br />show the Pitt, has only received 13 nominations.<br />The sheer volume of other awards alongside<br />outstanding drama suggests a high probability<br />in winning the award. Furthermore, the second<br />season of the show which was released just this<br />year received overwhelming praise for its final<br />episode, \"cold harbor\" which currently sits at<br />a 9.4 on IMDB, one of the highest rated episodes<br />of the series, compared to its closest competitor<br />in the category \"The Pitt\" who's season finale<br />\"9:00\" sits at only a 9.1. Lastly, looking at<br />current bets placed on the Emmy's, Severance has<br />a 2 in 3 chance of taking the award according to<br />DraftKings, which roughly translates to around<br />65%. All of these factors combined is why I<br />believe that Severance has around a 65% chance of<br />winning the Emmey for outstanding drama series.","Sade Ezekiel (22%): I believe that Russia and<br />Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire before November<br />25. This is because Trump has started the<br />negotiations between both parties and has met<br />with both individually. A ceasefire will also<br />be beneficial to Russia because of the sanctions<br />that the US and allies have imposed on them.<br />I think that the ceasefire might not last due<br />to both parties disagreeing on land lines and<br />negotiations.","Sade Ezekiel (68%): I believe that that severance<br />will win the Emmy award for outstanding drama<br />series. This is because Severance has gained of<br />publicity in the 3 years that it has been aired.<br />In the history of Severance it has won 2 Emmys in<br />season 1 under outstanding main title design and<br />outstanding music composition for a series. It<br />is really predictive that a show will win based<br />on how many Emmy nominations they have. Severance<br />has 27 total Emmy nominations and 10 major Emmy<br />nominations.","Sarah Kate Maher (25%): The leaders of Russia and<br />Ukraine won't even meet to discuss any diplomatic<br />matters right now, so I doubt that they would<br />get together to negotiate a ceasefire in the near<br />future. Even if they did in the next few weeks,<br />negotiations after that initial meeting may still<br />take longer. There is not a clear path to decide<br />on a ceasefire or to later enfore it","Sarah Kate Maher (60%): Severance has the most<br />nominations out of any of the other Emmy-nominated<br />works. It has a wider viewership and greater<br />overall engagement than The White Lotus, the<br />Last of Us, and Andor. Just based on the public<br />sentiments online after the release of the most<br />recent season, I'm confident that Severance will<br />win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.","Sasha Mahtani (13%): The reason for the<br />probability being so low is because of the<br />parameters we discussed in class. Considering<br />that Velensky and Putin haven't met face to face<br />since 2019 and this conflict has been going on<br />for over 3 years, it leads me to believe there<br />is a very small chance that a ceasefire will be<br />agreed upon by November 25th. There could be a<br />chance, however, when we consider Donald Trump's<br />support for a ceasefire, and how he has threatened<br />Putin with massive sanctions and tariffs. Since<br />this has been going on for so long it is unlikely<br />a ceasefire will happen within the next three<br />months.","Sasha Mahtani (74%): The reason I believe<br />Severance has a more than probable chance of<br />winning the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama<br />Series as they hold the higher number of<br />nominations compared to its main competitor, \"The<br />Pit\". Severance holds 27 nominations while The<br />Pit holds 13 total nominations. In the past, tv<br />shows with more nominations have a higher success<br />rate in winning the overall award. The themes of<br />the t.v. show are socially relevant and critically<br />acclaimed which leads me to believe there is a 74%<br />probability they will win.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (75%): It's no secret that<br />American entertainment awards, particularly<br />the \"Big 4\", have sometimes given priority to<br />what's most popular, not what's best. That works<br />in Severance's favor, as it is by far the most<br />popular show nominated for Outstanding Drama<br />Series. Popularity aside, Severance Season 2 has<br />received 27 nominations across various categories,<br />the most of any show and not far from the world<br />record, and these factors combined prove it more<br />than likely Severance will take home the award for<br />Outstanding Drama Series.","Zafar Ali (15%): This question seems to be a<br />reoccurring topic as this war has been going on<br />for the last three years. In the past there have<br />been pauses so it is not completely impossible<br />to see something happening in the near future.<br />However, I feel that there are many more factors<br />leaning toward a lower probability of a ceasefire<br />agreement. For instance, this war has been<br />going on for several years and it does not seem<br />advantageous for either side to come to a halt<br />now. From what I have gathered, both Russia and<br />Ukraine find it better to prolong the war as a<br />means of forcing the opposition into a weaker<br />position. Along with this, a ceasefire usually is<br />not strategic since it allows for both sides to<br />restock on resources, ammunition, weaponry, and<br />generally speaking prepare to go back to fighting.<br />A ceasefire does not seem very likely for the<br />reason that Russia and Ukraine have opposing<br />demands, most notably, they can't seem to agree<br />on territorial disputes. Russia essentially wants<br />Ukraine to concede certain territories to Russia<br />which Ukraine will not agree on as the main<br />reason this war has gone on so long is because<br />Ukraine is very staunch on fighting to protect<br />their sovereignty. When we also take into account<br />the parameters of the timeframe between now<br />and November 25th, this lowers the chances even<br />further because why would we see any form of a<br />ceasefire take place so soon after these past 3<br />years of the war? My prediction is that there is a<br />15% chance because I first considered the possible<br />reasons of seeing an agreement and weighed them<br />against the likelihood of not getting any deal. As<br />low as I believe the odds are, there aren't strict<br />parameters on whether or not a pause remains<br />throughout the original peace agreement.","Zafar Ali (65%): The first thing I think of when<br />it comes to this prediction is the popularity<br />and marketing of the show. When Severence season<br />two was about to release, I remember seeing it<br />everywhere online. I had not watched season 1<br />but after seeing all of the advertisement, I was<br />interested in catching up to see the new season.<br />I feel like that is an important factor because<br />it brings more attention to the show and with<br />that, garners a larger audience who will be more<br />invested. Severence is also leading with the most<br />nominations, 27 to be exact. I also understand the<br />Pitt is a big contender for the Outstanding Drama<br />Series category. Because of this, I do not rate<br />the probability too high. Looking at Polymarket,<br />I found that most people see Severance winning at<br />68% versus the Pitt at 32%. I found it important<br />to see what memebers in the Academy have to say<br />as they will be the ones voting. Critics on Vanity<br />Fair have shown sentiment that Severence will be<br />the frontrunner for this category. Critical Press<br />on the LA Times see it as a close call, leaning<br />toward the Pitt. There seems to be a bit of mixed<br />opinions, generally seeing this as a close call<br />between Severence and the Pitt. From other data<br />I found, there is roughly a 52-55% chance that a<br />most-nominated drama would win the award for drama<br />series. Based on the challenge of the Pitt as well<br />as the mixed seniment, I will put my prediction at<br />a 65% chance that Severence will win the Emmy for<br />Outstanding Drama Series."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.14999999999999999,0.69999999999999996],"y":[1.0052801532438025,1.9916337072616443],"text":["Crowd (15%)","Crowd (70%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.050000000000000003,0.84999999999999998],"y":[0.95193290016613896,1.9874236210482195],"text":["Joe Ornstein (5%): I was significantly more<br />optimistic about this earlier in the year, because<br />I felt that Putin would see an opportunity to<br />end the war on favorable terms.

I don't think<br />the Supreme Court will rule directly in opposition<br />of Trump and the tariffs he has set in place,<br />especially since the ideological disposition<br />of the court makes it so the majority does<br />lean right and in alliance with the president.<br />However, they could to some capacity address the<br />president's authority to impose such tariffs, as<br />many, including the Court of Appeals have argued<br />that he is exceeding his presidential capacities<br />by enacting such taxes. They could address the<br />wording of the International Emergency Economic<br />Powers Act in order to defend their argument and<br />refute the claim Trump made regarding his IEEPA<br />authority. But since the case has been expedited<br />and does hold some significance due to its impact<br />on not just the economy but also regarding just<br />how much power the president has when it comes to<br />imposing such restrictions, the case will surely<br />be reviewed and resolved at some point, just not<br />as soon as November 25th. Furthermore, despite<br />how important the case is, it is not nearly as<br />high stakes as a national crisis or constitutional<br />emergency, which is why it won't be addressed as<br />soon as possible.","Akshara Singh (20%): I think specifically because<br />of the amount of time left until November 25,<br />it is unlikely for the ruling on tariffs to be<br />appealed in time. As we discussed in class and<br />was mentioned in the briefings, despite the<br />case being expedited it doesn't hold as much<br />weightage/importance as other cases do. While it<br />is a high stakes case, it does not constitute as a<br />national security or constitutional emergency and<br />therefore could still take anywhere from 2-3 weeks<br />for a decision to be made. However, the Supreme<br />Court does have a history of overturning Court<br />of Appeals cases, and the majority of the current<br />court does fall within the same party and ideals<br />as the president, making me think they could vote<br />in favor of overturning a ruling that currently<br />goes against the tariffs Trump has imposed.<br />Despite everything that could happen, there is<br />still not enough time for the reversal to occur,<br />which is why my probability is so low.","Akshara Singh (55%): Few people benefit from a<br />full government shutdown. Taxpayers suffer and<br />the economy is negatively impacted, despite the<br />political leverage a party may gain from such<br />an event. Oftentimes, just the prospect of a<br />shutdown is enough of a sway to get political<br />players moving and coming towards a consensus. But<br />after the discussion in class it is also slightly<br />likely that a shutdown could happen because it<br />is possible there won't be as much backlash.<br />So overall, it's a very close call on whether a<br />shutdown could happen or not, and my probability<br />reflects that.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (65%): Since Congress needs<br />to approve the next budget by September 30th and<br />it doesn't look like they're close to reaching<br />an agreement, I estimate that there is a 65%<br />likelihood of a government shutdown in 2025. The<br />deadline is quickly approaching, but rather than<br />cooperating, both parties appear more interested<br />in squabbling about spending priorities and using<br />the circumstance for their own political ends. I<br />believe that a shutdown is more likely than not<br />given the level of division in Congress, even<br />though other analysts suggest the probabilities<br />are closer to 50/50. Federal agencies would be<br />forced to begin laying off employees, critical<br />services would stop or slow down, and the economy<br />might suffer from the uncertainty if legislators<br />are unable to agree a budget or at least a<br />temporary extension. A 65% chance, in my opinion,<br />indicates that a last-minute compromise is still<br />possible, but given the lack of collaboration<br />and the history of threatening to shut down the<br />government, I believe that a shutdown is the more<br />likely course of action.","Alizah Mudaliar (63%): There are three reasons<br />SCOTUS may reverse the Court of Appeal’s ruling.<br />First, SCOTUS decided to fast track the case could<br />lead to quicker ruling. Second, the IEEPA has<br />expanded the Trading with the Enemy Act, giving<br />Trump’s tariffs some merit. Third, conservatives<br />have the majority in the court, so they will<br />likely defer to the president. I believe it is<br />more probable to occur in several months.","Alizah Mudaliar (37%): There are three reasons<br />SCOTUS may reverse the Court of Appeal’s ruling.<br />First, SCOTUS decided to fast track the case could<br />lead to quicker ruling. Second, the IEEPA has<br />expanded the Trading with the Enemy Act, giving<br />Trump’s tariffs some merit. Third, conservatives<br />have the majority in the court, so they will<br />likely defer to the president. Despite this, it is<br />not very probable that the Court will overturn the<br />ruling in 2 ½ months. The amount of time remaining<br />for briefs and oral arguments leaves room for more<br />developments in the case and may lead to pushback<br />in the date they reverse the ruling.","Alizah Mudaliar (45%): 19 continuing resolutions<br />have been enacted in the past 6 fiscal years to<br />avoid government shutdowns. The last government<br />shutdown was from December 22, 2018 to January<br />25, 2019 due to disagreements over funding for a<br />border wall. It is more likely that there will be<br />another CR passed to avoid a government shutdown.<br />However, there have been 21 government shutdowns,<br />with three being during Trump’s presidency. But,<br />it is unlikely that all groups in Congress will<br />agree on the appropriations bill and the lack of<br />bipartisan support to avoid a shutdown makes the<br />likelihood of a shutdown more credible.","Amanda Neighbour (35%): Every year, the<br />lesgislature cannot agreed on a budget, but<br />time and time again, a last minute consinuing<br />resolution comes about. Hyperpartisanship<br />continues to cause issues in agreeing on a budget,<br />yet 12 appropriations must make it though House<br />and Senate committees to avoid being shut down.<br />There has been at least one continuing resoltuion<br />46 out of the last 49 fiscal years. With a<br />republican majority in every branch, I believe<br />this lessens the chance for a shutdown. Although<br />democrats seem like they are not budging, it is<br />important to note that almost every year this<br />same event occurs, and last minute continuing<br />resolutions end up extending the timeline.","Ana Valencia (35%): The Trump administration<br />argues that broad tariff powers are essential<br />to respond to economic emergencies, while<br />the Federal Circuit held that IEEPA does not<br />authorize sweeping tariff regimes without explicit<br />congressional approval. Conservative justices<br />like Alito and Thomas may be inclined to favor<br />reversal in the Supreme Court as well. However,<br />the Supreme Court could also affirm Congress'<br />power to oversee the IEEPA and Treasury. I give<br />35% that the Supreme Court will affirm the Court<br />of Appeals ruling anf give Congress the power for<br />trade meausres/tarriffs.","Ana Valencia (20%): While the Supreme Court<br />might ultimately reverse the Court of Appeals’<br />ruling on tariffs, the probability of doing so<br />before November 25 is fairly low. SCOTUS’s high<br />rate of overturning appellate rulings and the<br />broad language of the IEEPA as reasons to expect<br />reversal but within this short time frame it is<br />unlikely. Given the Court’s procedural pace as<br />well as its reluctance to expand executive power<br />into tariff-making without explicit congressional<br />approval, there is also a precedent of expedited<br />cases that we can take into account. I give<br />a 20% chance because, although the Court has<br />occasionally issued rulings within days or weeks<br />in urgent constitutional crises, tariffs do not<br />rise to the same level of immediacy as the topics<br />of the other expedited cases. The justices still<br />need to review briefs, hear oral arguments,<br />deliberate, and draft opinions which can take<br />several weeks. Unless the Court treats this case<br />as a matter of national security on par with its<br />most expedited decisions, the odds of a final<br />ruling before late November remain slim.","Ana Valencia (56%): I estimate that a shut down<br />will happen at 56% because of the time frame,<br />partisan politics, ahd historical track record<br />for shutdowns in the current administration. With<br />the Republicans controlling both the Senate and<br />House, it would seem feasible to avoid a shutdown<br />but if it does happen then the signing of a CR<br />will happen after funding expires. Even then,<br />partisan politics mean an obstacle for Republicans<br />in the Senate, where they need the support of 7<br />democrats to pass a funding bill in that chamber,<br />which seems unlikely. The longest shutdown was<br />also during a Trump Administration with 35 days to<br />reach conclusion.","Anna Barton-Caucci (30%): I think there is around<br />a 30% chance but It’s hard to say what the Supreme<br />Court will do because the justices often disagree<br />on cases about executive power. Some justices<br />might agree with the Appeals Court because the<br />law doesn’t clearly allow these tariffs. Other<br />justices could reverse it since presidents usually<br />have more freedom in emergencies or foreign<br />policy. Even though the Court is treating the case<br />as urgent, there still is no telling what will<br />actually end up happening.","Anna Barton-Caucci (53%): I believe there is a<br />50% chance that the government will shut down this<br />semester. Because there is only a 4 week deadline<br />for the Congress to agree on a plan, and there<br />does not seem to be an obvious, productive plan<br />for both parties right now I think it is very<br />possible the government could shut down. There<br />are several reasons lawmakers could work hard to<br />prevent a shutdown or find a temporary solution,<br />but I think it is still very possible. I am not<br />confident either way, but I think a shutdown is<br />very possible, despite it not being ideal.","Anna Kneser (22%): I believe that the Supreme<br />Court will reverse this case, but the question is<br />will they do that before November 25th? Trump v.<br />Hawaii is a very similar case, and it was decided<br />in just over five months. Therefore, I doubt that<br />the case will be reversed in 3 months time due to<br />the amount of briefs due and oral arguments that<br />need to occur. Even though the expedited procedure<br />was enacted under the Trump administration, many<br />other cases that have had this same procedure took<br />more than three months. However, because there<br />is more aggression and public upheaval toward<br />this reversal, there is always the possibility<br />that the timeline of this case will speed up, so<br />my prediction increased to 22%. However, I still<br />don't think it is likely.","Anna Kneser (55%): With the end of the fiscal<br />year on September 30th, there is a possibility<br />that the government will shut down due to the<br />lack of money. Even though a shut down is not<br />ideal, the past 3 shutdowns have been under the<br />Trump Administration. Because Trump is president<br />currently, this sways my prediction to higher<br />than 50% because he has shown he is not afraid<br />to enable a shut down. There is not much time to<br />reach a compromise, and democrats and republics<br />are having a difficult time making a deal. I find<br />it hard to believe that any party will budge.<br />However, I'm cautious to make my prediction<br />higher than 55% because this shutdown would have<br />a very negative effect on the Republican Party and<br />Trump's reputation, especially when there is so<br />much political turmoil tied to his name right now.<br />Nobody wins in a shutdown, and it is practically<br />irrational for both parties.","Arshia Charkhian (15%): I am predicting a 15%<br />chance, since the Supreme Court still holds favor<br />toward the Trump administration, while Congress<br />clearly holds tariff authority and the Major<br />Questions Doctrine limits executive overreach.<br />However, there is a possibility the Supreme<br />Court may reinterpret IEEPA broadly and back<br />presidential tariff authority.","Arshia Charkhian (55%): I am uncertain about<br />a government shutdown due to its unpredictable<br />nature, but I lean towards it happening due to how<br />divided both parties are. The Trump administration<br />is not adverse to shutdowns, with it happening<br />twice before, so it is unlikely that he will<br />intervene to make a deal.","Blake Martin (42%): i gave this probability a 45%<br />because since we are under a unified government<br />it will be hard for there to be a government<br />\"shut down\" without major pushback. On top of<br />this nobody wants a government shutdown. Voters<br />are not in favor of it and lawmakers as well.<br />The democratic party is just going to comply<br />because that seems as if it is already happening.<br />I am not extremely confident however because<br />democratic leaders now are more likely to push for<br />confrontation on the possible budget proposals and<br />might contest the budget more leading to a \"shut<br />down.\" However, recent news outlets are saying<br />now that Trump is proposing a possible continuing<br />resolution which would prevent the government from<br />have a \"shut down.\"","Breanne Talley (35%): The Supreme Court has agreed<br />to hear the tariff case, showing it wants to<br />clarify how much power the president has under<br />the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.<br />Still, a full reversal of the Court of Appeals’<br />7–4 ruling is unlikely. The lower court stressed<br />constitutional concerns about giving the president<br />too much unchecked authority, and the Supreme<br />Court has recently limited broad executive powers<br />through the “major questions” doctrine. While<br />the fast-track schedule shows urgency, it is more<br />likely the Court will affirm or slightly adjust<br />the ruling. Overall, the chance of reversal is<br />modest—about 35%.","Breanne Talley (25%): There is a possibility of<br />this happening since the case is expedited. Even<br />with these decisions, it can take days or even<br />weeks to come out. They are still not even going<br />to hear the case till the beginning of November,<br />so it would have to be a quick turnaround. With<br />this being a more intricate case, I don't think it<br />will be a quick decision.","Breanne Talley (45%): I would say there is a<br />roughly 45% chance the U.S. federal government<br />will shut down before November 25, 2025. Congress<br />hasn’t passed any of the FY 2026 appropriations<br />bills, and the October 1 deadline makes an early<br />shutdown possible. However, prediction markets<br />(Polymarket ~43–49%) and historical patterns<br />suggest lawmakers usually pass a short-term<br />continuing resolution at the last minute to avoid<br />blame. The fight over ACA subsidies adds risk, but<br />political incentives point toward a stopgap deal<br />that keeps the government open.","Caleb Lux (40%): This prediction is more likely<br />than the time-limited counterpart, but I still<br />find it more likely than not that the court<br />will uphold the lower level ruling. The legal<br />argument seems to greatly benefit the current<br />standing on IEEPA, although it is far from certain<br />that this court will not blindly support this<br />administration's position.","Caleb Lux (25%): I find it unlikely that the court<br />at all will rule before this question resolves.<br />It will hear oral arguments on the case in early<br />November, but it could take up to 8 weeks before<br />a decision is released. Moreover, the legal<br />case surrounding Trump's tariffs is favorable to<br />upholding the Appellate Court's opinion. However,<br />the current high court has consistently found ways<br />to benefit the current administration regardless<br />of precedent or sound legal reasoning.","Caleb Lux (60%): It is more likely than not that<br />the government will shutdown at the end of this<br />month. Democrats are not in a position to strike<br />a deal, and Republicans need to tow a careful line<br />to keep a compromise that the Freedom Caucus would<br />agree to. There were two shutdowns in Trump 1, and<br />he isn't positioning himself as the dealmaker this<br />time around. The politics of the moment may be too<br />difficult to avoid a shutdown.","Caroline Mattox (30%): I think there is chance<br />that they reverse the ruling before November 25th<br />but because of the large amount of briefings and<br />arguments that they have to go through I just<br />don’t see a high chance of the decision being made<br />before that deadline which is why I chose the 30%.","Caroline Mattox (58%): I believe there is a 58%<br />chance that we see a government shutdown at some<br />point before the end of the semester. I believe<br />there is such a high chance of this happening<br />because the two parties have such a hard time<br />coming to an agreement on anything. I think there<br />is small chance that they reach an agreement<br />but I’m not sure that it will happen before the<br />deadline.","Chris Haswell (52%): If the Supreme Court releases<br />a ruling before November 25, I am unsure if it<br />will be in President Trump's favor. To me, the<br />language is clear: a president cannot unilaterally<br />enact tariffs without Congressional approval.<br />However, I also didn't think presidents would be<br />immune from any action they committed in office,<br />so I'm not sure how the Court will rule. Usually<br />the court reverses appelate decisions, however<br />this one seems to have bipartisan support. I think<br />this decision is as close to 50-50 as it gets, and<br />I am only leaning towards an overturning of the<br />ruling because of the pro-Trump precedent that the<br />Court has established.","Chris Haswell (35%): I don't think we will see<br />a decision before November 25 because this case<br />does not appear to be an emergency, and the<br />Supreme Court usually takes longer than two weeks<br />to release a decision. If we do see a decision,<br />I think there is a good chance that the Supreme<br />Court rules in favor of Trump and overturns<br />the ruling given their history of backing his<br />executive actions. However, this case seems<br />especially legally dubious, given the wide backing<br />of conservative scholars against the President.<br />This makes me think that the Court will take a<br />while to deliberate, ultimately postponing the<br />decision until after November 25.","Chris Haswell (65%): I think it is more likely<br />than not that Democrats will vote to shut down the<br />government. Democrat voters and thought leaders<br />are more ideologically opposed to the Trump<br />administration than ever, and many influential<br />democratic pundits like Ezra Klein went as far<br />as to call for a change in democratic leadership<br />if they move to keep the government open.<br />Personally, I don't see how the Democrats could<br />strategically vote for a CR when a shutdown would<br />hurt Republicans worse. They are being pressured<br />to put up more of a fight, and I think it is<br />likely that they will take this opportunity to<br />win over disillusioned moderates and democrats<br />who are tired of their complicity with unpopular<br />Republican policies.","Cierra Green (40%): The court has historically<br />shown to be reluctant in expanding the president's<br />powers in these types of situations. Specifically,<br />the Supreme Court would be less inclined to grant<br />powers for tariffs. These powers better align<br />with Congress. However, 6 of the justices lean<br />conservative, 3 of which were appointed by Trump.<br />Therefore, they may be more inclined to support<br />him. My score is less confident because there<br />is not a time limit on it. If given more time<br />(other than a November 25 deadline), the court is<br />technically more likely to reverse the appeal.","Cierra Green (25%): Due to the timeline of typical<br />Supreme Court rulings, it is unlikely that the<br />decision would be made by the deadline of November<br />25th. Although the court has granted the right to<br />expedite, they still must go through briefings,<br />oral arguments, and discussions to the final<br />decision. This process can take months. Also, the<br />Supreme Court has historically been reluctant to<br />grant powers such as this to the president since<br />that is more so the power of Congress.","Cierra Green (55%): As of right now, Democrats nor<br />Republicans seem to want to make a compromise or<br />cave into the other party's demands. Specifically<br />for the Democrats, Chuck Schumer faced backlash<br />for backing the CR in March 2025. His party and<br />supporters are upset his his March decision and<br />are pushing him to unite the Senate Democrats.<br />As mentioned in class, Democrat supporters would<br />also be upset with their representatives if they<br />folded to the Republican's wishes. This would<br />lead to a shutdown. As seen in the past, the<br />Trump administration is not afraid of a government<br />shutdown to get what they want either. However,<br />it is possible that Congress members will make<br />a last minute agreement that both Democrats<br />and Republicans are willing to pass. While<br />researching this question, there were no official<br />statements about Congressmen voting in accordance<br />with the opposing party. This is because it is<br />very unlikely someone would make that a public<br />statement. If any Congress members were to switch<br />sides on voting, we would not know at this time.<br />Therefore, I am not very confident that a shutdown<br />will happen, but I believe it is more likely to<br />happen than to not happen.","Elizabeth Nelson (12%): I think because of<br />the complexity of the cases and arguments and<br />briefings that it will likely take months for<br />this to be settled/resolved, and even though<br />it has been scheduled to begin the first week<br />of November, I think with so many other factors<br />playing into the presentation and execution of<br />this case it will not happen before November 25th.","Elizabeth Nelson (35%): The fiscal year begins<br />October 1st, and a lot of briefings and even<br />Polymarket suggests that it is very close to a<br />50/50 shot. President Trump has indicated that he<br />will make the budget catered toward republicans,<br />so democrats are at the point where they are fed<br />up since they are supposed to be creating this<br />\"bipartisan\" budget, but it could be vetoed at any<br />point. I think that the CR will be passed through,<br />and a government shut-down will be avoided. I<br />think it is a lot more rare to have a shutdown<br />when one party has control over three branches,<br />and the last shutdown was as a result of democrats<br />not wanting \"The Wall\" to be government funded. I<br />think that there is a chance the government could<br />shut down, but I think more likely a different<br />agreement willo be reached.","Francesca Mariano (60%): The current SCOTUS is<br />known for not respecting precedent and overturning<br />decisions from the Court of Appeals. It is also<br />majority conservative, with six of the nine<br />Justices being conservative, three of these having<br />been appointed by Trump. SCOTUS recently reached<br />a decision that immigration status could lawfully<br />be inquired about based on race, displaying<br />the extent to which they will simply not follow<br />precedent, and arguably the Constitution itself.<br />The IEEPA, the legislation under which Trump<br />enacted the tariffs, potentially has vague<br />language that could allow for Trump's actions, but<br />the Court of Appeals ruled that enacting tariffs<br />of this nature is expressly a Congressional issue.<br />Yet, predicting how some of the less originalist<br />Justices will sway is a challenge. Given the<br />unpredictability of the SCOTUS and its recent<br />history of not upholding previous rulings and<br />aligning with Trump, I predict a probability of<br />60% that SCOTUS will reverse the Court of Appeal's<br />ruling on tariffs.","Francesca Mariano (23%): Given that the oral<br />arguments for this case are not set to begin<br />until the first week of November, I do not think<br />the court will reach a decision by November 25th.<br />Consolidated cases such as this one already take<br />longer, and even when consolidated cases are<br />expedited, they take longer than non-consolidated<br />cases. A similar case SCOTUS saw under the first<br />Trump administration took about two months, so I<br />find it safe to assume that they will not reach a<br />decision in less than a month. I also think that<br />because this case is so controversial, SCOTUS may<br />intentionally take its time. I also acknowledge<br />the unpredictability of the current administration<br />and SCOTUS. Combining these factors and the<br />probability provided by my peers, I think there<br />is a 23% chance SCOTUS will reverse the Court of<br />Appeal's ruling on tariffs before November 25.","Francesca Mariano (54%): Government shutdowns are<br />extremely unpopular amongst voters and politicians<br />alike. They hurt the economy anf they leave<br />millions out of work for however long the shutdown<br />is. Oftentimes, Congress passes a continuing<br />resolutions (CRs) to stave off government shutdown<br />and extend time to amend and debate the budget.<br />The last three government shutdowns were under<br />the Trump Administration, including the longest<br />in history of 35 days. With increased polarization<br />and previous deals made by minority leader<br />Schumer, many of the briefs thought it unlikely<br />for many, if any, compromises or deals to be<br />made before the next possible shutdown period<br />without another CR. Trump has also been reportedly<br />making it harder for Congress to come to an<br />agreement, causing his party to also be unwilling<br />to comprise. Given the seemingly legislative<br />stalemate on the budget and the unpopularity<br />of government shutdown, I place my probability<br />similar to those my of classmates at 54%.","Ellie Null (25%): I predict that there will be<br />a 25% chance of the US Supreme Court reversing<br />the Court of Appeal's ruling on tariffs before<br />November 25. I think there are a lot of high<br />stakes cases that have been expedited and cases<br />like this that have been and still took longer.<br />Furthermore, getting an oral argument to the point<br />of full decision in less than three weeks would<br />be a fast timeline for the supreme court. They<br />have also not indicated that they are on track or<br />gunning for this fast-paced decision making even<br />though it's been expedited. They normally take<br />about 6-8 weeks unless it is a state of emergency<br />decision. In conclusion I predict that there is<br />around a 25% chance of reversal by the Supreme<br />Court. There is so much polarization around this<br />decision so I presume that there will be a lot<br />of debate and time dedicated to this decision.<br />However there is always room for developments.<br />so it's not to say it won't happen, it just might<br />take longer due to the fact that there is a lot of<br />pushback.","Ellie Null (55%): I predicted that there is a 55<br />percent chance of a government shutdown. Every<br />year it's an argument about how much to spend and<br />what areas should be prioritized over others. Over<br />a dozen governments shut down over this budget<br />issue every year. Don't last long but do happen.<br />The budget needs three points of agreement to<br />get this budget passed and due to this political<br />climate i dont sense that there will be an easy<br />agreement about this budget in the future. However<br />no one really benefits from a shutdown, so there<br />is a 50/50 chance of an agreement for the benefit<br />of everyone. 3 democrats who voted for cloture<br />would need to switch their vote out of the nine.<br />I also think public and media outcry will effect<br />this decision as well. It is going to be hard to<br />tell, so I stand at 55 percent.","Jack Lutz (63%): The Supreme Court is set to hear<br />oral arguments starting on the first of November.<br />A turnaround involving arguments, deliberation,<br />and putting out an official statement will likely<br />take more than the 3 weeks that stand between the<br />opening and this question's deadline. I do not<br />see this question as being seen as a 'necessary'<br />expedited case, which are often wrapped up in<br />2-3 weeks, so it will likely extend into December<br />before a ruling is given.","Jack Lutz (37%): The Supreme Court is set to hear<br />oral arguments starting on the first of November.<br />A turnaround involving arguments, deliberation,<br />and putting out an official statement will likely<br />take more than the 3 weeks that stand between the<br />opening and this question's deadline. I do not<br />see this question as being seen as a 'necessary'<br />expedited case, which are often wrapped up in<br />2-3 weeks, so it will likely extend into December<br />before a ruling is given.","Jack Lutz (45%): While many of those serving in<br />the house and the senate on both sides of the<br />aisle would like to avoid a shutdown, leadership<br />on both sides and the Trump administration keeps<br />making the passing of a continuing resolution less<br />and less likely. Due to recent pressure, Chuck<br />Schumer is less likely to fold and compromise<br />with the Republicans, and will likely be seen<br />as the example of which way to vote/act for many<br />of his own party. Other key democrat leaders<br />are hardlining that they are willing to accept a<br />shutdown rather than the terms proposed to them.<br />Finally, Trump has continued to demand additions<br />to the budget that do not appeal across the aisle<br />and has caused discourse within his own party.","Jackson Bost (55%): The current Roberts Court<br />relies heavily upon originalist interpretations of<br />the Constitution, meaning that they seek to rule<br />based on what they think the Founders intended.<br />This has been reflected in cases like West<br />Virginia v. EPA, where Justice Gorsuch issued a<br />concurring opinion that heavily based its decision<br />upon the separation of powers. This, though, does<br />not mean that SCOTUS is in the habit of upholding<br />cases. In Trump v. US, Chief Justice Roberts<br />upheld Youngstown's idea in the majority opinion<br />that Congress and presidents can have concurring<br />authority if it comes from an authorization<br />by Congress. The IEEPA gives the President<br />emergency powers over transactions, which could<br />give SCOTUS a path to rule against the Appeals<br />decision--especially considering that the Court<br />has undone injunctions and upheld spending freezes<br />in the un-originalist name of efficiency.","Jackson Bost (35%): While a ruling overturning<br />the Court of Appeals' decision would have a<br />number of implications for international trade<br />and the President's policy agenda, SCOTUS is not<br />particularly concerned with our timeline, and<br />there seems to be little reason to issue a ruling<br />on this case as soon as possible. Of the major<br />expedited cases, three related to wars, two with<br />government accountability, and one election, and<br />all of them were sudden events requiring sudden<br />decisions. Only one had a background that started<br />more than two months prior and was decided quickly<br />enough to fit our timeframe: Dames & Moore v.<br />Regan. That case, though, was decided under one of<br />the most activist courts in history on the ground<br />of Congress's \"acquiescence,\" a fairly subjective<br />ruling. This case, which has been in the news for<br />some time without jumping directly to SCOTUS, now<br />comes in front of an originalist court that will<br />need more time to consider the full depth of the<br />Constitution.","Jackson Bost (52%): Democrats in Congress are<br />growing increasingly restless with the Trump<br />administration's attacks on their power of the<br />purse, with that likely to worsen in the wake of<br />Chief Justice Roberts's decision to permit the<br />freeze of foreign aid funding while a legally<br />untested pocket recission works its way through<br />Congress. While certain senators like Shaheen<br />and King (voted for the CR in March), Schumer and<br />Durbin (senate minority leaders), and Cortez Masto<br />(swing state voter against filibusters) could be<br />expected to vote for cloture, Senators Gillibrand,<br />Hassan, and Peters could very well vote against it<br />with mounting pressure from the party. Given that<br />Senator Ossoff, someone up for reelection in the<br />next cycle in the most contested seat in the US,<br />staved off constituents' calls on the last vote,<br />senators who aren't up again until 2030, 2028,<br />and are retiring lack the same sort of pressure to<br />give in to a CR.","James Hunter Darke (58%): I would say that they<br />will reverse the decision due to the makeup of<br />the court. However, I am still very uncertain<br />when this may happen. It all depends on how much<br />weight they give the major questions doctrine,<br />and whether they believe Congress gave implicit<br />authority etc.","James Hunter Darke (40%): I would have to say no<br />for the November 25th deadline. I do not think<br />that this is enough time for the court to fully<br />evaluate and make a decsision to reverse it in<br />such a short time period. We all know how long<br />court precodures take, and with a conservative<br />court, they will likely try to push this off. With<br />a longer time frame my answer will be different,<br />but in such a short time frame, I do not think it<br />happens.","Jhaycee Barnes (55%): The Court fast-tracked the<br />case, which shows they’re at least open to the<br />government’s side. Plus, SCOTUS has a history<br />of siding with presidents in cases dealing with<br />economic issues and foreign affairs like Dames<br />& Moore v. Regan, Regan v. Wald, and Trump v.<br />Hawaii. Still, the Appeals Court leaned on the<br />Court’s own major questions doctrine, and since<br />Congress didn't spell out that IEEPA covers<br />tariffs, some justices may hesitate to hand the<br />president unlimited tariff power.","Jhaycee Barnes (25%): Arguments for the case<br />are set for early November, and that gives 2<br />weeks for everything to happen by November 25th.<br />After looking at Amanda's research on previously<br />expedited cases, it doesn't seem likely that the<br />court will issue an opinion in that short amount<br />of time. But they have moved at high speeds in<br />rare situations, and with billions at stake, all<br />that market uncertainty could push them to act<br />quicker this time.","Jhaycee Barnes (46%): In the past few decades,<br />shutdowns have been rare. In most years, one<br />side of Congress fights until the very end and<br />eventually \"folds\" with a last minute CR. However,<br />the current political context raises the odds of a<br />shutdown. Congress is super divided, and President<br />Trump has an interesting style of negotiating<br />and has shown before (during the longest shutdown<br />in history) that he is not afraid to allow a<br />shutdown to occur. At the same time, with midterms<br />approaching, both parties have strong reasons to<br />avoid the public backlash that would come from an<br />extended shutdown.","Kira Fleischer (28%): The conservative legal<br />establishment argues against this use of IEPA, so<br />looking at the specific facts of this case, I do<br />not think it is likely. I think even it if were<br />to be overturned, that happening before November<br />25th is unlikely. Courts take a while to make<br />decisions, and with no time limit on this one,<br />I think the court will takes it s time to decide<br />(and eventually decide to uphold the decision).","Kira Fleischer (51%): It seems that a the<br />likelihood of a government shutdown could really<br />go either way. Partisanship within the legislative<br />and executive branches has been making budgeting<br />extremely difficult, which could spiral into<br />a shutdown. Also, strong democrat voices are<br />less willing to negotiate, and may influence a<br />shutdown.","Kristoffer Fields (38%): While this is much harder<br />question to answer because it does not set a dated<br />timeline on the lift. While the SUPREME court has<br />taken the request on an expedited schedule I still<br />find it unlikely to occur due to various legal<br />issues at play such as the supreme courts idea of<br />what a tariff and the seperation and delegation of<br />powers in the US government","Kristoffer Fields (20%): While I think this is<br />a very big economic issue at the moment I have<br />a deep lack of faith in how fast the American<br />legal process works plus our current head of state<br />is very against the topic. So I would place it<br />unlikely but not certainly unlikely, 20 percent.","Kristoffer Fields (35%): I would place the<br />probability of a shutdown occurring to be about 35<br />percent because while I do think it is plausible<br />and could happen for various reasons like money<br />mismanagement I still think that it is more<br />likely to not shutdown, because despite political<br />partisanship within the government I do not think<br />it is enough to swing into a nationwide shut down.","Liz Yancey (57%): Considering this is more of a<br />conservative court, I think they will rule with<br />the President. I think it depends on how they will<br />go forward, defining \"emergencies\" as well. I'm<br />iffy on whether they will consider the reactionary<br />tariffs constitutional because, on their face,<br />they seem based on other concerns not rooted in<br />national security measures. The fentanyl argument<br />seems fine and could be justifiable.","Liz Yancey (45%): SCOTUS won't issue a decision by<br />Nov. 25, but if they do, I bet they will overturn<br />the appellate court decision. Even if they<br />expedite it, they still have to deliberate, and<br />that can take days or weeks. The court being more<br />conservative signals to me that they are likely to<br />eventually overturn the decision.","Liz Yancey (45%): I think that if this CR is<br />anything like the one in March, Republicans<br />will fight to pass it. If they already have the<br />majority in all three branches, any opposition<br />the Democrats can muster up will be seemingly<br />inconsequential. Public opposition was widespread<br />and intense in March, yet that did not deter<br />Republicans from opposing the CR. It will come<br />down to whether the CR is 'clean.' If it's not, it<br />will lose Democratic support and possibly even the<br />support of Republican moderates as well. There is<br />still a decent chance it will shut down, but based<br />on last time, I doubt it will.","Manuv Datta (70%): There is a 75 percent chance<br />of no ruling by November 25 because the Court<br />granted review on September 9, set briefing<br />through October 30, and scheduled argument in<br />early November, leaving little time for a signed<br />opinion. The en banc Federal Circuit ruling, the<br />major questions doctrine, and competing readings<br />tied to Curtiss Wright and Dames and Moore create<br />cross pressures that slow consensus. The justices<br />can manage uncertainty with interim orders, which<br />do not resolve the merits.","Manuv Datta (70%): There is a 70 percent chance<br />of a ruling by November 25 that rejects Trump’s<br />position because the expedited schedule signals<br />urgency, and the path of least resistance is<br />to affirm that IEEPA does not clearly authorize<br />tariffs. Tariffs look like taxes that belong to<br />Congress, and the Court has recently demanded<br />clear authorization for sweeping economic actions.<br />The Federal Circuit’s reasoning provides a ready<br />blueprint. A short judgment could issue quickly<br />after argument, with opinions to follow, limiting<br />uncertainty while preserving separation of powers.","Manuv Datta (75%): No, the federal government<br />will not be shut down at any point during the<br />remainder of the semester. I make this estimate<br />based mainly on the fact that while under<br />President Trump, the federal government has shut<br />down on 5 separate occasions. This amount is<br />more than double than that of the next President,<br />which is 2, under President Bill Clinton.<br />Although the federal government is currently very<br />contentious and partisan, a 6th shutdown would be<br />unprecedented, and is further away on the spectrum<br />of probability. Therefore, I am taking the bet<br />that Congress manages to pass a budget bill<br />successfully.","Mateo Ceron (85%): I think that the Supreme Court<br />will reverse the decision made by the Court of<br />Appeals. While it all relies on how they intend<br />to use IEEPA and what sections of it apply to<br />the tariffs, I think the Supreme Court has sided<br />with the Trump administration in a couple of<br />controversial decisions. Therefore, I am more<br />confident that the Supreme Court will rule in<br />favor of a reversal of the decision made by the<br />Court of Appeals.","Mateo Ceron (28%): I don't think that the Supreme<br />Court will reverse the decision before November<br />25th. Although there has been an appeal for<br />an expedited process, the oral arguments don't<br />happen until November 1st. That leaves a very slim<br />timeline for the Court to reach its decision. The<br />only time that anything has had that quick of a<br />turnaround has been the Tik Tok case, but I'm not<br />sure it would happen again","Nic Curtis (70%): With no time limit set on this<br />question, I feel much more confident answering<br />\"yes\" to this question. I think that the Supreme<br />Court will end up reversing the lower courts<br />decision on tariffs. One of the briefings<br />mentioned that nearly 75% of appealed cases are<br />over turned by the court. While this may be less<br />with cases regarding tariffs or taxes, it seems<br />to me that the Court has recently struck down<br />other federal judges orders regarding the Trump<br />administrations actions. This is common as the<br />Court usually \"grants\" the president authority<br />when they attempt to push the limit of their<br />powers.","Nic Curtis (45%): I think that the Supreme Court<br />will end up reversing the lower courts decision<br />on tariffs. One of the briefings mentioned that<br />nearly 75% of appealed cases are over turned<br />by the court. While this may be less with cases<br />regarding tariffs or taxes, it seems to me that<br />the Court has recently struck down other federal<br />judges orders regarding the Trump administrations<br />actions. This is common as the Court usually<br />\"grants\" the president authority when they attempt<br />to push the limit. The only reason my probability<br />is lower is that I think that it is less likely<br />that the court release their decision prior to<br />November 25. I do not think that the case is a<br />big enough emergency to warrant a quick decision<br />following oral arguments.","Nic Curtis (65%): There are many obstacles<br />that are in the way of preventing a government<br />shutdown. Democrat leadership faced immense<br />backlash from their constituents this past<br />March when they caved into Republican demands,<br />but prevented a shutdown. Democrats have little<br />incentive to keep the government running as it<br />would express their continued displeasure with the<br />current administrations use of the government's<br />resources. Republicans, on the other hand, have<br />a majority in both chambers of congress to, in<br />theory, pass what ever budget plan they want.<br />Despite their majority, some in their own party,<br />such as the Freedom Caucus in the House and Rand<br />Paul in the Senate, may oppose a plan if it does<br />not align with their goals of cutting spending.<br />On top of all of this, Trump would need to approve<br />the budget plan which, if not up to his liking,<br />he can deny. There is precedent for this as two<br />government shutdowns, including the longest one<br />in US history, occurred during his first term.<br />The only reason I think a shutdown may not happen<br />is due to the possible passage of a CR, which has<br />happened multiple times now and at the very last<br />minute, but it is hard to say as we do not know<br />the details of the CR. Even if a CR is approved<br />before the end of the month, the issue may crop up<br />again before the end of the semester depending on<br />the details.","Owen Johnston (40%): I give a probability of 40%.<br />The main reasons the Court would reverse would be<br />its tendency to side with Trump. However, I think<br />the more textualist Justices such as Gorsuch and<br />Coney Barrett would actually agree with the COA<br />decision, because the IEEPA due to the lack of<br />explicit language authorizing this Presidential<br />power. I then think the three \"liberal\" Justices<br />would vote to keep the COA ruling. This alone<br />gives 5 votes in agreement with the Circuit<br />Court. However, it is still likely that this<br />\"conservative\" court, the same one that ruled<br />presidential immunity exists, would reverse and<br />give Trump this power to execute one of his key<br />policy goals.","Owen Johnston (25%): I give the probability of<br />25% mainly just due to the timeline constraints.<br />Regardless of what decision the court will make,<br />I find it more likely than not that the Court<br />will release their decision regarding tariffs by<br />November 25th. For example, Trump v. Hawaii took<br />two months to decide.","Owen Johnston (40%): Given that little progress<br />has been made in Congress on a CR or budget,<br />I give it 40%. I believe it is more likely,<br />however, that the government narrowly avoids a<br />shutdown because Republicans hold majorities in<br />the House and Senate, and hold the Presidency. The<br />Republicans will desire to avoid a shutdown to not<br />appear as being unable to govern.","Paul Frilingos (59%): We got very close to a<br />government shutdown earlier this year, with the<br />senate cloture vote being by a margin of 3. Since<br />it's unlikely for the House to agree on a new<br />budget, a continuing resolution is the far more<br />likely method of preventing a shutdown. However,<br />the Democrats who chose to vote for cloture on<br />the CR earlier this year faced a lot of pushback<br />from supporters, so they could be more willing to<br />prevent a CR from passing this time. On the other<br />hand, the concern is high for Democrats that a<br />shutdown would be blamed on them and hurt their<br />reelection chances. Senate majority leader Chuck<br />Schumer now seems to be against any partisan CR,<br />but we'll see if that stays true come September<br />30. Ultimately, I think a shutdown is more likely<br />than not, but I'm not too confident.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (75%): I would<br />put the chance at about 75% that the Supreme Court<br />will eventually reverse the Court of Appeals’<br />ruling on tariffs. The Court’s conservative<br />majority has often leaned toward giving presidents<br />broad authority in national security and foreign<br />affairs, and it tends to overturn a lot of<br />appellate decisions. So I think reversal is more<br />likely than not.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (30%): I would<br />put the chance at about 30% that the Supreme<br />Court will reverse the Court of Appeals’ ruling<br />on tariffs before November 25. The case is on<br />a fast track with arguments scheduled for early<br />November. I think the Court usually takes longer<br />to work through this kind of case that deals<br />with separation-of-powers. On one hand, precedent<br />points to caution about expanding presidential<br />authority under the IEEPA, but on the other<br />hand, the conservative majority and the Court’s<br />pattern of overturning lower court rulings open<br />the possibility for a reversal. I think a ruling<br />reversing the case is possible but within that<br />time frame is kind of unlikely.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (40%): I put<br />the chance of a shutdown at 40%. Things are<br />looking tense, but Congress usually finds a way<br />to avoid letting the government actually run out<br />of money. A shutdown would be costly, disruptive,<br />and politically damaging. I also think that<br />most lawmakers, especially those worried about<br />re-election, have many reasons to strike some<br />kind of deal. A shutdown is still possible, in my<br />opinion, but it is not the most likely scenario.","Reese Fabritius (65%): With the hostility and<br />polarization happening right now, I think it<br />is more likely than not that there will be a<br />government shutdown. I think with midterms coming<br />up, both sides will want to show strength as I<br />believe has already been proven by the recent<br />budget proposals.","Ruhi Doddamani (30%): SCOTUS is not going to be<br />able to get that reversal through in time, even<br />withTrump granted them that expedited procedure.<br />Also, he's dragging their attention elsewhere with<br />all these deportations being declared unlawful by<br />the state courts. Decisions are published mid-next<br />year, which is past our timeline.","Ruhi Doddamani (78%): I think my personal politics<br />are definitely seeping into my prediction, but<br />I'm relying on how the atmosphere has shifted<br />since six months ago in the aftermath of Schumer's<br />ill-received compromise. I've heard on ABC and<br />NBC that have had Democratic thought leaders<br />and actual respresentatives who voted last times<br />around that are displaying a change of heart,<br />because it's obvious the GOP is sheparding their<br />current agenda primarily through federal funding.<br />A shutdown would be the best way to confront<br />everything and check some reckless actions.","Ryan Marx (25%): I believe that there is only a<br />25% chance of the supreme court reverse the court<br />of appeals ruling on tariffs because historically<br />speaking the supreme court has been reluctant<br />to allow the executive branch to make greater<br />decisions on tariffs and other economic decisions<br />that might strip power from the legislative<br />branch. Also, with the oral arguments scheduled<br />for early November and the time it takes for<br />deliberation and a decision to be written, I<br />believe that there is only a 25% chance of the<br />decision being reversed before nov.25.","Ryan Marx (50%): I believe there is approximately<br />a 50% probability that the US Federal government<br />will be shut down by the End of the Fall<br />Semester. My first bit of reasoning is that<br />while historically many government shutdowns have<br />been avoided last minute, but with the trend of<br />Brinkmanship and an increase of partisan conflict<br />over the past few years this makes this specific<br />outcome seem less and less likely. Furthermore<br />Republican lawmakers in both the house and senate<br />hold the majority by a slim margin, with Democrats<br />declining to support a funding resolution due<br />to exclusion from negotiations meaning that<br />republicans are quite unlikely to come to the<br />table less they run the risk of losing the<br />majority.","Sade Ezekiel (57%): I believe there is a great<br />chance that the Supreme Court will reverse<br />the court of appeals ruling on taxes in the<br />near future. Most of the court is made up of<br />conservatives which gives President Trump an<br />advantage. I think that the court will grant<br />access to the president allowing him to impose the<br />taxes under IEEPA legally.","Sade Ezekiel (34%): I believe that there will be a<br />low chance that the US Supreme Court will reverse<br />the court of Appeals on tariffs before November<br />25th because it is stated in the constitution that<br />taxes rely solely on the legislative branch. This<br />means that the President does not have the right<br />to impose taxes on IEEPA because it is not under<br />his jurisdiction. While there is a chance that the<br />Supreme Court will reverse the ruling due to most<br />of the court being conservative; I believe that<br />this will not happen before November 25th.","Sade Ezekiel (35%): With the current threat of<br />a potential government shutdown, I believe that<br />there is a very low chance that the government<br />will shut down before the end of the semester.<br />Considering that we have not even completed<br />one year with Trump and the Republicans back in<br />office, it is in their best interest to reach an<br />agreement without major disruption and another<br />shutdown occurring under his lead. Moreover, if<br />the government did shutdown this would have a<br />very negative effect on Trump and the Republican<br />party’s reputation, after a very turbulent and<br />aggressive entry when resuming control. Although,<br />there are just a few short weeks before the end of<br />the fiscal year, where Congress must agree to the<br />presented spending or pass a short-term solution<br />approach. I would say 35% because there is also<br />pressure on the democratic party to not cave into<br />the Republicans negotiations.","Sarah Kate Maher (30%): I put 30 mostly so as to<br />not seem so confident, but I really don't think<br />it will happen. As someone said in their brief,<br />the Supreme Court always defers to the current<br />president and I think a lot of the Court's recent<br />decisions really follow that. I think that the<br />Court will see the tarriffs as within presidential<br />power, though some justices may oppose the<br />tarriffs ideologically or on a constitutional<br />level.","Sarah Kate Maher (20%): The briefings alone in<br />this case may take us right up to the deadline for<br />this question to resolve as yes. Though this is<br />an expedited case, it is not high stakes enough<br />to be decided by the end of the semester. So I<br />think purely for timeline reasons, it's not going<br />to happen. I also think that with everything else<br />going on, public pressure will decline immensely<br />and tarriffs will not be at the forefront of<br />peoples' minds, allowing the Supreme Court to push<br />the decision back even further.","Sarah Kate Maher (55%): In order for the<br />government not to shut down by the start of the<br />fiscal year on October 1st, Trump has to sign<br />all 12 appropriations or Congress has to pass a<br />continuing resolution. A continuing resolution was<br />enacted in March of 2025, which makes it likely<br />that another one might be enacted now. Therefore,<br />I'm kind of 50/50 on it will happen, but leaning<br />a little more towards yes because of the political<br />climate in Congress right now where neither side<br />wants to back down and \"lose\".","Sasha Mahtani (20%): I do not think that the US<br />Supreme Court will reverse the Court of Appeals<br />ruling on tariffs before November 25th as that<br />leaves a very short window to make the ruling. As<br />we discussed in class, the Supreme Court takes the<br />shortest amount of time in rulings when the cases<br />are more high stakes. Based on the timeline of<br />these previous cases, it is highly likely that it<br />will get pushed back and will not be reversed by<br />November 25th.","Sasha Mahtani (40%): It fairly likely that the<br />government will shut down before the end of the<br />semester. Considering the high party tensions,<br />and Trump's correlation between his presidency<br />and government shutdowns it is completely possible<br />that a shutdown is enacted. The reason why there<br />is doubt, is because no single party wants to take<br />any blame for a shutdown, as they prepare for the<br />2026 midterm election cycle. I gave a 40 percent<br />probability considering how neither parties want<br />this to be enacted.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (20%): While the Supreme Court<br />reversing the Court of Appeal's decision before<br />November 25 is a near impossibility, a reversal<br />by the end of this semester is a more difficult<br />question. Although there is time now to find out,<br />I still find it unlikely the Supreme Court will<br />rule against the Court of Appeal's very strong<br />case that Trump's tariffs violate constitutional<br />authority. I don't believe the Supreme Court<br />currently has sufficient reason to disagree with<br />the ruling.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (10%): Before the question of<br />the Supreme Court reversing the Court of Appeal's<br />ruling at all should even be considered, the fact<br />that it must happen before November 25 renders<br />this highly unlikely. The Supreme Court is slow<br />to action already and a certiorari does not fall<br />too high on national priority. Reversing this<br />ruling would take months of deliberation and<br />argumentation before we could see a reversal,<br />making November 25 too soon of a deadline.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (30%): Government shutdowns are<br />quite rare in American history, although I can't<br />put them behind Donald Trump given that the last<br />two were under his administration- and in the<br />same year. While that and the budget disagreement<br />persisting as we approach this deadline might<br />make a shutdown inevitable, headlines 10 hours ago<br />revealed the White House has requested Congress<br />to extend the deadline to January 31st- making a<br />shutdown unlikely. Given everything else going on,<br />Trump’s only concern might be not looking worse.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (90%): I predict that the<br />Supreme Court will overturn the court of appeals<br />ruling. Despite the legal arguments that exist, I<br />find that institutional erosion is too prevalent<br />in all chambers of the United States government.<br />The current trend of MAGA party loyalty will<br />outweigh any legal argument that can be made.<br />Party dissidents, like Thoms, were threatened<br />to get primaried and Trump even attempted to<br />convert career jobs to those that report to the<br />administration (schedule G). Trump appointed 3<br />of the 9 justices, and 6 of the 9 currently on<br />the Court are considered conservative. Given<br />this ideological makeup and partisan pressures, I<br />think the case will be overturned to preserve the<br />tariffs and allow later ones to be levied. Had it<br />been another president in a different political<br />climate, they would not have been in effect this<br />long.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (90%): I predict that the<br />Supreme Court will overturn the court of appeals<br />ruling.

Given the<br />ideological makeup and partisan pressures, I think<br />the case will be overturned before November 25th<br />in order to preserve the tariffs.","Zafar Ali (40%): This connects to the main<br />prediction, but now there is no time restriction.<br />With that, it is a bit more plausible to see the<br />US Supreme Court reversing the ruling from the<br />Court of Appeals. Based on statistical data I<br />found, the US Supreme Court has a 60-70% reversal<br />rate when it comes to Court of Appeal decisions.<br />There is also a 6-3 conservative majority, which<br />could help to rule in favor of Trump’s tariffs and<br />use of IEEPA. With that being said, I believe it<br />is more likely to see this happen than the last<br />prediction, but I still don’t think it will 100%<br />occur. Also, when it comes to the conservative<br />majority, that doesn’t always do much because<br />most issues deal with upholding the law and<br />constitution over individual political beliefs or<br />affiliations. I am sitting at a 40% chance that<br />there will be a reversal of the Court of Appeal’s<br />ruling.","Zafar Ali (18%): Based on my own research in<br />combination with the briefings, it seems as<br />though the likelihood for this prediction are<br />fairly low. There are many factors to account<br />for, however, the main thing that makes me think<br />this is unlikely is the timeframe having to be<br />before November 25th. In the past, rulings dealing<br />with IEEPA have tended to be deemed more urgent<br />for the reason that they were viewed within the<br />realm of national security. Trump’s use of IEEPA<br />was broad and not necessarily in this group of<br />urgency. Because of that, I believe that the US<br />Supreme Court will take their time with this case.<br />They have said that they will start hearings in<br />November, however, that does not necessarily mean<br />they will have a decision within a few weeks. It<br />is likely to take a few months which exceeds the<br />time range given.

And<br />the legislative history clearly suggests that it<br />was intended to *reduce* the president's power<br />to unilaterally impose tariffs.

Even with<br />its expedited schedule, it would be highly unusual<br />for the Court to take less than three weeks to<br />write a full merits opinion on such an important<br />case. Amanda identified just a handful of cases<br />over the past century that were decided a matter<br />of days after oral argument, and these were cases<br />where there was a compelling need for speed (e.g.<br />Bush v. Gore, United States v. Nixon). I don't<br />see anything compelling the justices to work so<br />quickly in this case; it is much more likely we'll<br />see a decision in 6-8 weeks.
