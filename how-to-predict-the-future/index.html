ESPN<br />gives UGA a 91.5% chance of winning. Yes; I am<br />copying ESPN for my homework.","Patrick Egan (90%): Using data from the<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration<br />(NOAA), which is apparently part of the Chamber<br />of Commerce, I was able to pull up the low<br />temperatures for every September day for the<br />previous 10 years. In those 10 years, 9/10<br />Septembers had a day where the low was below 62,<br />which the only exception being 2018. There is<br />currently a 3 year streak of having at least one<br />low in the high 50s, and I anticipate that to<br />continue.","Patrick Egan (10%): The chances of breaking a bone<br />are low, especially for people in their 18s-20s.<br />The class is also small so there's a really small<br />chance of this happening. However, I'm not sure<br />if Ornstein counts as being \"in the class\" or<br />not, but with age comes a higher risk of breaking<br />a bone, so I put 10% on the off chance he slips<br />while roller skating or something.","Joseph Kennedy (95%): Georgia football is better<br />than Oregon football. Also the game is in Atlanta<br />and even tho it is a neutral field more UGA fans<br />will most likely come.","Joseph Kennedy (35%): In Athens from the months of<br />August to September, the average low during these<br />months is 67 degrees Fahrenheit. On average, this<br />makes it unlikely that the temperature will drop<br />below 62, but there is a slight chance since it is<br />only a 5 degree difference.","Joseph Kennedy (5%): I think it is very hard to<br />break a bone as most people have never broken a<br />bone in 18 years. I find this very unlikely that<br />someone will break a bone in this class beofre the<br />end of the semester.","Meredith Stevens (90%): 1) 2022 National Champs 2)<br />Have beat Oregon past several years","Meredith Stevens (75%): 1) Georgia weather is very<br />bipolar it has a high chance to hit that at least<br />once 2) We transition into fall making the weather<br />colder","Meredith Stevens (10%): 1) Not a high chance<br />unless it’s some freak accident 2) Bone breaks<br />don’t occur as commonly as they did when we were<br />kids because we are more cautious.","Noah Herndon (90%): Georgia is coming off a<br />National Championship winning season, and I don't<br />see them struggling with any SEC teams in the<br />regular season much less a PAC-12 team. Oregon<br />is the same team that lost to Utah twice in the<br />same season last year. Oregon is also coached by<br />Dan Lanning, the former defensive coordinator of<br />the dawgs. I think it would be a lie to say that<br />Kirby doesn't have him figured out. And finally,<br />while our QB just won a national championship and<br />decided to come back for even more, their QB has<br />lost to the dawgs 3 years in a row at Auburn. I<br />give Oregon a 10% chance to win because any team<br />in college football can win at any time, so it<br />would be unreasonable to give the dawgs a 100% to<br />win.","Noah Herndon (80%): I give it an 80% chance to<br />happen because if we look at past trends, such<br />as last years weather, the temperature dropped<br />below 62 degrees Fahrenheit multiple times before<br />October.","Noah Herndon (25%): I give this question a pretty<br />low probability of happening. Breaking bones<br />aren't really often occurrences. Bones are usually<br />broken through sports, and I highly doubt anyone<br />in this class will be playing sports for UGA which<br />is why I give it a low probability of occurring.","Edward Cox (85%): Uga is a much more talented<br />team through recruitment, their new head coach<br />is our past defensive coordinator. They have lost<br />valuable players due to the transfer portal due to<br />their past coach leaving.","Edward Cox (15%): Geographically, Athens is in a<br />place where the temperature doesn’t drop below 70<br />degrees Fahrenheit until later October. Being in<br />the south of the US, the weather is all over the<br />place but due to the humidity and the sunlight<br />exposure every day, it is very unlikely.","Edward Cox (35%): It is unlikely that someone will<br />break a bone because annually, about 2.8 out of<br />100 people break a bone. since this is half of a<br />year, I took that in half and based it off of how<br />many people are in the class. Then, I considered<br />the possibility that people are going to be drunk<br />which raises your chances to break a bone by 2<br />times. lastly, this is the first time people are<br />living by themselves so they are more likely to do<br />stuff without thinking as much.","Andrew Decker (80%): Although the game is not<br />a home game, the game is still in the state of<br />Georgia so UGA will still have a \"home\" field<br />advantage. UGA also has had better recruiting<br />classes than UofO so I think they have better odds<br />a winning.","Andrew Decker (90%): According to recent data,<br />Athens temperature have reached into the 50's<br />towards the end of September. In the past 10<br />Septembers, 9 out of 10 have reached under 62.","Andrew Decker (10%): Statistics show that 7.7% of<br />people between 15-24 break a bone every year. With<br />that stat in mind I believe the odds are low of<br />someone breaking a bone from now until Nov.","Joe Ornstein (89%): The Vegas moneyline (https://<br />www.vegasinsider.com/college-football/matchups/<br />georgia-vs-oregon/) is currently -909 for a bet on<br />UGA. You can win $100 if you risk $909. That only<br />makes sense for bettors if they think there's at<br />least a 90% chance that UGA will win ( 909 divided<br />by 100 + 909 ). This is consistent with ESPN's<br />model (https://www.si.com/fannation/college/cfb-<br />hq/ncaa-football/georgia-oregon-week-1-college-<br />football-picks-predictions-odds-line-spread)<br />called the \"Power Index\", which predicts a 91.5%<br />chance that UGA will win.","Joe Ornstein (98%): Looking back through<br />the Weather Underground archives (https://<br />www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ga/athens/<br />KAHN/date/2021-9), the temperature at the Ben<br />Epps weather station has dropped below 62 F before<br />September 30 every year this century. But the<br />*number* of days with temperatures below 62 F has<br />been decreasing. It seems extremely unlikely, but<br />not impossible, that we'd break the streak this<br />year.","Joe Ornstein (15.7%): There are roughly seven<br />million broken bones each year in the United<br />States, or an incidence of about 2% of the<br />population per year. A study from England<br />(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2008-01-annual-<br />bone-fracture-percent-previous.html) suggests that<br />the rate of fracture is twice as high for people<br />in the age group we're considering, so let's<br />say 4% per year. That's about 1% per 3 months<br />(September - November). If each member of the 17-<br />person class (including me, but assuming that at<br />least one person never shows up) has a 1% chance<br />of breaking a bone, then the chance that *no one*<br />breaks a bone is 0.99^17, or about 84.3%. The<br />chance that at least one person breaks a bone is<br />100 minus that.","Jeremy Lee (85%): 1. UGA is coming off of a<br />dominant championship season 2. UGA football is<br />the best in the nation","Jeremy Lee (15%): 1. It’s been very hot in GA<br />recently 2. Each year, it’s been getting hotter","Jeremy Lee (30%): 1. A lot of people play sports<br />so there is a good chance someone could break a<br />bone 2. I think that breaking bones isn’t that<br />common as an injury","David Barrero (85%): UGA is the reigning National<br />Champion and only lost one game last year while<br />Oregon lost three of their last five games the<br />previous season. UGA was also ranked #3 in best<br />recruiting classes of 2022 while Oregon was ranked<br />#13.","David Barrero (70%): In 2021, the temperature<br />in Athens fell below 62 degrees Fahrenheit<br />about 5 times during the month of September. The<br />probability is lower this year because of global<br />warming and the rise in the average temperatures<br />every year.","David Barrero (35%): As people reach their young<br />adult stage they are less likely to break a bone<br />because their bone mass is denser. The probability<br />is higher because a lot of students in our class<br />do play sports which increases the chance that<br />someone in the class will break a bone.","Arianna Ycaza (90%): The game is in Atlanta, there<br />will be many more UGA fans than Oregon fans there<br />which will rally up the dawgs.","Arianna Ycaza (40%): I think it will happen early<br />morning or at overnight between now and the end of<br />September, but not soon and not during the day.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): We have a lot of recreational<br />athletes in this class, but I don't believe we<br />have any UGA athletes. Because of this, it is safe<br />to say that we do not have too many people with<br />time to do activities such as sports to risk a<br />bone break.","Hannah Jones (90%): The University of Georgia<br />athletic teams are part of the south-eastern<br />conference (SEC) which is the strongest conference<br />in the nation compared to any other. The<br />University of Georgia also has signed more 5-star<br />recruits than any other football team in the past<br />five years, making them overall stronger than any<br />other team. This leads me to believe UGA will win<br />against Oregon.","Hannah Jones (55%): Georgia weather is highly non-<br />reliable and constantly changing from one end of<br />the spectrum to another. Some days are 85 with<br />others going all the way down to 60. Because of<br />this i believe there is a fair chance that at<br />least one day will fall under 62. Georgia weather<br />also sees a lot of rain, with rainy skies comes<br />lower temperatures. Leading me to believe there is<br />a slight but very possible chance that the weather<br />could fall under 62.","Hannah Jones (20%): It is very rare to see someone<br />on campus with a cast on because they broke a<br />bone. With all the classes at UGA, I find it very<br />unlikely that one of the smallest classes such as<br />ours (around 15-20 people) would have someone with<br />a broken bone. I also think that there may be some<br />sort of injury but not to the extent of breaking.<br />Breaking a bone would mean a serious hit was<br />taken. Leading me to believe there is a very low<br />chance of someone in our class breaking a bone.","Mac Kinnebrew (85%): The spread of this game is<br />-17 in Georgia's favor so they are highly favored.<br />This game is also in Atlanta which is much closer<br />to Athens than Eugene, Oregon, giving Georgia<br />heavy home field advantage.","Mac Kinnebrew (90%): I think this because over<br />this history of weather being recorded here the<br />average low is around 60 in the last week of<br />September. Last year there were around 10 days<br />that the temp dipped below 62 so it is highly<br />likely to happen this year.","Mac Kinnebrew (20%): We have 17 people in our<br />class so I think there is a low chance someone<br />breaks something. I do think there is a chance<br />though because a lot goes on in college and freak<br />accidents do happen.","Ian Driggers (75%): I think that UGA is a better<br />football team that Oregon but I am not 100%<br />confident. Football is a sport and like any sport,<br />anything can happen on any given day.","Ian Driggers (60%): I haven’t lived in athens<br />very long but I think that it will drop below 62°<br />Fahrenheit by September 31st.

But if I were to guess, I do know the<br />publicity might be the motive.","Joe Kennedy (41%): ESPN gives uga on average, a<br />93% to win each game. However, since there is a<br />93% change to win each game 12 different times,<br />we must raise .93 to the 12th power to get our<br />probability which is 41%","Joe Kennedy (65%): Georgia is one of the cheapest<br />states for gasoline, as as the supply for gas<br />has began to increase again, I would say a drop<br />in twenty cents in 8 and a half weeks is pretty<br />likely. This considers how gas prices have dropped<br />25 cents in two weeks in Athens, GA. However,<br />something like Russia v Ukraine could happen again<br />and limit supply of gasoline.","Joe Kennedy (100%): Yes it abs already happened as<br />of August 30, 2022, his approval rating hit 44%,<br />the highest of the year.","Joe Kennedy (5%): This is very unlikely due<br />to Kanye’s song “heartless”, where in the song<br />he says “you run and tell you friends that you<br />leaving me / they say that they don’t see what<br />you see in me / you wait a couple months then you<br />goin’ see / you’ll never find nobody better than<br />me” and these lines reflect what just happened<br />with Kim and Kanye after Kim broke up with Pete.<br />I think Kanye’s ego is to big to take Kim back,<br />especially due to these lyrics he wrote and<br />released over 10 years ago.","Patrick Egan (34%): I found a website where some<br />guy simulated the 2022 CFB season 1,000 times.<br />In the 1,000 simulations he ran, UGA won 12/12<br />games in 340 of the 1000 simulations. Here's<br />the website: https://phenrickson.github.io/cfb/<br />team_profiles/preseason/2022/Georgia.html","Patrick Egan (1%): In the past week, the gas<br />price has dropped 4 cents. In 13 weeks, it will<br />be November 30th. It is unlikely the gas price<br />will be a constant 4 cents per week, but it is<br />definitely likely to keep dropping and now balance<br />out yet. However, it's like the drop will be<br />between 30-52 cents. Meaning I'm expecting the<br />price to be below $3.00 on November 30th, and<br />especially below $3.10. However I didn't put 0%<br />because I'd look very dumb if it ended up being<br />above $3.10.","Patrick Egan (50%): I wasn't sure what to answer,<br />so I decided to determine his approval rating<br />using the worst possible prediction method<br />possible: Asking strangers on Reddit. Only 6<br />responded, very helpful, internet. The responses<br />split 3-3.","Patrick Egan (0%): Kanye West will be too busy<br />planning his 2024 Presidential Election campaign<br />to even consider lending even a short moment<br />of his attention span over to Kim Kardashian.<br />Kim Kardashian will start October by dating a<br />multitude of men, including Drake, James Harden,<br />Pete Davidson again, Joe Ornstein, and Glen<br />Quagmire. However, on November 29th, Kim will run<br />up to Kanye and beg Kanye to get back together<br />with him, but before he can accept, he gets a call<br />from the Republican Party informing him that he<br />has already won the nomination for the Republican<br />ticket in the 2024 election, and decides that he<br />doesn't have time to date Kim and also win the<br />presidential election. They end up not getting<br />back together, and Kanye West ends up becoming<br />president, and he marries Pete Davidson instead.","Noah Herndon (90%): I give the dawgs a 95% chance<br />to go undefeated because we just beat the number<br />11 team in the nation 49-3 and they were supposed<br />to be our toughest opponent on the schedule.<br />After the ducks, the only teams that may give us<br />a problem in the first quarter are probably just<br />Tennessee, Kentucky, and Florida, but none of<br />those teams have a chance at beating us. We may<br />be a better team this year than last and that's<br />saying something. That was some of the best<br />offense I've ever seen out of the dawgs and our<br />defense just reloaded.","Noah Herndon (60%): I'm not too confident on the<br />probability of this one happening either, but I am<br />going to lean towards gas being higher than $3.10<br />because there is no telling what could happen in<br />the war in Ukraine and how that could affect gas<br />prices.","Noah Herndon (60%): I have no clue, so I'm going<br />to play it safe. I'll give it a 60% chance of it<br />being over 42% because he is currently over 42%<br />and the approval ratings don't drastically change<br />that much.","Noah Herndon (10%): Kanye can post on Instagram<br />and dog on Pete Davidson all he wants, but that<br />doesn't mean he is going to get back with Kim. I<br />think Kanye could've had a chance to get back, but<br />he's done too much damage to be able to win Kim<br />back over. I don't think the way you win your ex-<br />wife back over is posting private messages all<br />over social media.","Joe Ornstein (32%): Outside View: Since 2000,<br />there have been 5 out of 22 seasons where an SEC<br />team went undefeated (none of them UGA). This<br />suggests an \"optimism ceiling\" of about 23%. The<br />chance that Georgia goes undefeated should be less<br />than the chance that any SEC team goes undefeated.<br />Alternatively, if I thought that UGA had a 90%<br />of defeating Oregon, and has the same chance of<br />defeating each of the remaining 11 teams in its<br />regular season (optimistic), then its chance<br />of going undefeated is 90% x 90% x 90% .... 11<br />times, which is about 31%. Inside View: Georgia<br />is facing a pretty favorable set of teams in<br />the regular season this year. Arguably our most<br />challenging opponent is Tennessee. Consequently,<br />ESPN's statistical model gives UGA a 21% chance of<br />going undefeated (including the SEC champsionship,<br />presumably against Alabama), which suggests<br />roughly a 40% chance of going undefeated in the<br />regular season alone. I'll split the difference<br />between these two perspectives.","Joe Ornstein (15%): The 2022 rise in gas prices<br />was driven by a reduction in supply related to the<br />pandemic and Russian sanctions, plus resurgence<br />in demand since lows in early 2020. Oil production<br />is a long term investment, so it takes years to<br />bring new capacity online, but the trends are<br />towards increasing production plus decreasing<br />demand (owing to increasing fuel efficiency /<br />electric vehicles). It is most likely that gas<br />prices will decrease the rest of the year. But<br />will they decrease by 20 cents per gallon in 3<br />months? The national average price for regular gas<br />has decreased $1/gallon over the past 2 months,<br />so that's not an implausible rate of change.<br />Futures markets (a type of market where you can<br />buy, say, a barrel of crude oil for a certain<br />price a certain number of months from now) suggest<br />that regular gas will decrease by 51 cents during<br />the final quarter of 2022 (https://www.eia.gov/<br />outlooks/steo/report/prices.php) Of course,<br />there may be further supply disruptions: there<br />could be another pandemic, or an escalation in<br />the Ukraine-Russia War, or some other Black Swan<br />event that drives up oil prices again. Also, maybe<br />the Marathon outside of Russell Hall goes out of<br />business, and I'm not sure how we'll resolve the<br />question if that happens.","Joe Ornstein (75%): Outside View: There are 87<br />days between now and November 30. Between days<br />591 and 678, most presidents over the past 50<br />years have slightly improved their approval<br />numbers. (The exception is Bush 2, whose numbers<br />were artificially high post 9/11). Since Biden's<br />approval rating is currently above 42%, this<br />suggests a greater than even chance that it will<br />still be above 42% in three months. Generally,<br />presidential approval has become more stable<br />over time, as the electorate has polarized and<br />people tend to make up their minds about the<br />president early on. Large three month swings are<br />unlikely without a significant external event.<br />Inside View: Biden's approval rating lows over<br />the summer seemed pretty closely tied to concerns<br />about inflation, particularly gas prices. (There's<br />a weak, but significant relationship between<br />the price of gas and presidential job approval:<br />https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/<br />articles/gas-prices-and-presidential-approval/).<br />If I think there's an 85% chance of gas prices<br />going down significantly, then I should think<br />there's a similar chance of Biden's approval<br />rating staying where it is or inching higher.","Joe Ornstein (1%): Outside View: According to some<br />research, 10-15% of divorced couples eventually<br />reconcile. There is some evidence that celebrity<br />marriages are twice as likely to dissolve as<br />normies (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/<br />better-divorce/202206/why-many-divorced-partners-<br />remarry-each-other), and 3 months is a short time<br />window, so 10% seems like an upper bound. Inside<br />View: To help me with this question, I consulted<br />with an expert in the field of Kardashianism, my<br />wife Carly. She is a person who, let's say, keeps<br />up with the Kardashians. From this conversation,<br />I gather that Kimye's differences are<br />irreconcilable, and there is very little chance<br />that this will be one of those 10% of divorces<br />that get back together. At some point over the<br />next three months, Kim will do *something* to<br />get back on the public's radar, but it's unlikely<br />to be getting back with Kanye. I'll tack on one<br />percent because things happen.","Adam Szczupak (84%): The only games I think they<br />have a change to lose are Tennessee, Kentucky, and<br />Florida. Each of these games according to ESPN are<br />about 90% chance of Georgia winning. So all three<br />together (parlayed) imply a lower probability than<br />90, but still high.","Adam Szczupak (38%): Gasoline prices have<br />consistently been lowered over the last few<br />months, and I expect this trend to continue. The<br />uncertainty lies in to what extent.","Adam Szczupak (69%): Due to midterm elections in<br />early November, Biden will likely not say or pass<br />anything that would lower his party’s electability<br />or popularity.","Adam Szczupak (5%): Kim has never gotten back<br />together with an ex and Kanye has publicly been<br />shaming her for her actions with their children.<br />Although they were once married and would announce<br />it publicly rather soon.","Jeremy Lee (75%): After watching the Oregon game,<br />I can tell that UGA is a very dominant team - UGA<br />was undefeated in the regular season last year","Jeremy Lee (60%): - I honestly don't know because<br />the gas prices have been dropping, but they can<br />rise again - I think it will have to be above<br />$3.10 because of inflation","Jeremy Lee (75%): Biden's approval rating has been<br />increasing in the past 100 hundreds - The trend<br />from the other presidents has been increasing in<br />approval rating as they approach the 2nd year","Jeremy Lee (10%): - They seem to have a strong<br />disliking against each other now - They don't seem<br />to match each other's personalities","audrey vaughan (95%): all the teams they play in<br />the regular season they beat last year they had an<br />undefeated regular season last year","audrey vaughan (75%): although gas prices have<br />been dropping, its not very likely for it to drop<br />20 cents in 3 months inflation will probably not<br />get much better within the next 3 months.","audrey vaughan (85%): the previous presidents<br />stay pretty constant with their rating after the<br />2nd year, and he's at 42% right now, and it wont<br />be very likely for it to drop much lower based on<br />previous ratings. the population of republicans<br />and democrats are both around 40% and dont seem to<br />drop much lower than that.","audrey vaughan (5%): Kanye has brought their<br />relationship very public and bashed Kim several<br />times online, so because they've made everything<br />so public it would be harder for them to get back<br />together without Kim embarrassing herself. it's<br />been made very apparent that Kanye's relationship<br />with his children has gotten much worse and for<br />their sake I don't think Kim would get back with<br />him.","David Barrero (88%): If the SEC championship<br />does not count toward the regular season UGA will<br />go undefeated this regular season because their<br />schedule does not looks similar if not worse than<br />last year where they went undefeated. I give UGA<br />a 12% chance of not going undefeated because these<br />are young players which mean more mistakes can<br />take place and sports can be a very volatile when<br />trying to give predictions.","David Barrero (65%): Not much information to<br />gather and make a confident forecast, but usually<br />during the winter gas prices tend to drop which<br />is why the probability is low. I don't believe it<br />will fall as much as $3.10 because gas prices have<br />been very high this year and will continue to be<br />for the rest of the year","David Barrero (90%): Since January 2021 Biden's<br />approval rating fell under 42% in about three<br />or four of the months during that time span. The<br />November midterms could bring it under 42% by<br />making everything more divisive.","David Barrero (5%): I haven't seen any evidence<br />to show that either party are moving towards<br />reconciling with each other. Kanye continues to<br />post random stuff on his Instagram while having<br />internet \"beef\" with Pete Davidson who is Kim's ex<br />now.","Hannah Jones (85%): UGA will play teams ranked<br />much lower than them in the SEC. These teams<br />include: Missouri, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt. Even<br />the teams ranked a little higher do not stand a<br />chance against UGA's defense. UGA also has much<br />more 5 stars and returning strong players from<br />years before. Many of these players obtain a<br />major part in the offensive side of the team. The<br />only thing I can say to pose the opposite opinion<br />is that sports is very dependant on the actions<br />within the game. UGA could lose to any of these<br />teams solely because of a bad game, which is why<br />i put 85% of winning instead of 100%. But, UGA has<br />the potential to go undefeated this season.","Hannah Jones (70%): Gas will only continue to<br />increase due to competitors having to constantly<br />raise their prices. Not only that but it will be<br />football season in Athens which means gas will<br />be particularly high for a while to gain as much<br />money as possible. I think the price will stay<br />around $3.49 or definitely above $3.10. Football<br />season is prime time to make as much profit as<br />possible especially for home games when so many<br />fans travel.","Hannah Jones (55%): Currently (two months before),<br />it is 42.8% approve. I believe this means he<br />has rather a very good chance of that increasing<br />above 42% very easily by November 30th. I believe<br />this will also have a lot to do with the current<br />elections upcoming. Not only that, but looking at<br />the graph is shows that Biden's approval has only<br />increasingly gone up since July, which gives a<br />strong hint that it will continue to grow.","Hannah Jones (50%): Kanye will most likely<br />come out with an album before he gets back<br />together with Kim. This would be the perfect<br />publicity stunt. I believe after the album has<br />been successful, him and Kim will then publicly<br />announce that they are back together. Yet, knowing<br />how dramatic KIm and Kanye are, the chance of them<br />announcing they are back together before November<br />30th is still majorly possible. This makes my<br />prediction an even 50/50 because with these two A-<br />list celebrities, you really cannot say.","Andrew Decker (50%): I think UGA looked very<br />strong in its first game against Oregon. I would<br />say that the only challenge to UGA this season are<br />is UTK.
