ESPN<br />gives UGA a 91.5% chance of winning. Yes; I am<br />copying ESPN for my homework.","Patrick Egan (90%): Using data from the<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration<br />(NOAA), which is apparently part of the Chamber<br />of Commerce, I was able to pull up the low<br />temperatures for every September day for the<br />previous 10 years. In those 10 years, 9/10<br />Septembers had a day where the low was below 62,<br />which the only exception being 2018. There is<br />currently a 3 year streak of having at least one<br />low in the high 50s, and I anticipate that to<br />continue.","Patrick Egan (10%): The chances of breaking a bone<br />are low, especially for people in their 18s-20s.<br />The class is also small so there's a really small<br />chance of this happening. However, I'm not sure<br />if Ornstein counts as being \"in the class\" or<br />not, but with age comes a higher risk of breaking<br />a bone, so I put 10% on the off chance he slips<br />while roller skating or something.","Joseph Kennedy (95%): Georgia football is better<br />than Oregon football. Also the game is in Atlanta<br />and even tho it is a neutral field more UGA fans<br />will most likely come.","Joseph Kennedy (35%): In Athens from the months of<br />August to September, the average low during these<br />months is 67 degrees Fahrenheit. On average, this<br />makes it unlikely that the temperature will drop<br />below 62, but there is a slight chance since it is<br />only a 5 degree difference.","Joseph Kennedy (5%): I think it is very hard to<br />break a bone as most people have never broken a<br />bone in 18 years. I find this very unlikely that<br />someone will break a bone in this class beofre the<br />end of the semester.","Meredith Stevens (90%): 1) 2022 National Champs 2)<br />Have beat Oregon past several years","Meredith Stevens (75%): 1) Georgia weather is very<br />bipolar it has a high chance to hit that at least<br />once 2) We transition into fall making the weather<br />colder","Meredith Stevens (10%): 1) Not a high chance<br />unless it’s some freak accident 2) Bone breaks<br />don’t occur as commonly as they did when we were<br />kids because we are more cautious.","Noah Herndon (90%): Georgia is coming off a<br />National Championship winning season, and I don't<br />see them struggling with any SEC teams in the<br />regular season much less a PAC-12 team. Oregon<br />is the same team that lost to Utah twice in the<br />same season last year. Oregon is also coached by<br />Dan Lanning, the former defensive coordinator of<br />the dawgs. I think it would be a lie to say that<br />Kirby doesn't have him figured out. And finally,<br />while our QB just won a national championship and<br />decided to come back for even more, their QB has<br />lost to the dawgs 3 years in a row at Auburn. I<br />give Oregon a 10% chance to win because any team<br />in college football can win at any time, so it<br />would be unreasonable to give the dawgs a 100% to<br />win.","Noah Herndon (80%): I give it an 80% chance to<br />happen because if we look at past trends, such<br />as last years weather, the temperature dropped<br />below 62 degrees Fahrenheit multiple times before<br />October.","Noah Herndon (25%): I give this question a pretty<br />low probability of happening. Breaking bones<br />aren't really often occurrences. Bones are usually<br />broken through sports, and I highly doubt anyone<br />in this class will be playing sports for UGA which<br />is why I give it a low probability of occurring.","Edward Cox (85%): Uga is a much more talented<br />team through recruitment, their new head coach<br />is our past defensive coordinator. They have lost<br />valuable players due to the transfer portal due to<br />their past coach leaving.","Edward Cox (15%): Geographically, Athens is in a<br />place where the temperature doesn’t drop below 70<br />degrees Fahrenheit until later October. Being in<br />the south of the US, the weather is all over the<br />place but due to the humidity and the sunlight<br />exposure every day, it is very unlikely.","Edward Cox (35%): It is unlikely that someone will<br />break a bone because annually, about 2.8 out of<br />100 people break a bone. since this is half of a<br />year, I took that in half and based it off of how<br />many people are in the class. Then, I considered<br />the possibility that people are going to be drunk<br />which raises your chances to break a bone by 2<br />times. lastly, this is the first time people are<br />living by themselves so they are more likely to do<br />stuff without thinking as much.","Andrew Decker (80%): Although the game is not<br />a home game, the game is still in the state of<br />Georgia so UGA will still have a \"home\" field<br />advantage. UGA also has had better recruiting<br />classes than UofO so I think they have better odds<br />a winning.","Andrew Decker (90%): According to recent data,<br />Athens temperature have reached into the 50's<br />towards the end of September. In the past 10<br />Septembers, 9 out of 10 have reached under 62.","Andrew Decker (10%): Statistics show that 7.7% of<br />people between 15-24 break a bone every year. With<br />that stat in mind I believe the odds are low of<br />someone breaking a bone from now until Nov.","Joe Ornstein (89%): The Vegas moneyline (https://<br />www.vegasinsider.com/college-football/matchups/<br />georgia-vs-oregon/) is currently -909 for a bet on<br />UGA. You can win $100 if you risk $909. That only<br />makes sense for bettors if they think there's at<br />least a 90% chance that UGA will win ( 909 divided<br />by 100 + 909 ). This is consistent with ESPN's<br />model (https://www.si.com/fannation/college/cfb-<br />hq/ncaa-football/georgia-oregon-week-1-college-<br />football-picks-predictions-odds-line-spread)<br />called the \"Power Index\", which predicts a 91.5%<br />chance that UGA will win.","Joe Ornstein (98%): Looking back through<br />the Weather Underground archives (https://<br />www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ga/athens/<br />KAHN/date/2021-9), the temperature at the Ben<br />Epps weather station has dropped below 62 F before<br />September 30 every year this century. But the<br />*number* of days with temperatures below 62 F has<br />been decreasing. It seems extremely unlikely, but<br />not impossible, that we'd break the streak this<br />year.","Joe Ornstein (15.7%): There are roughly seven<br />million broken bones each year in the United<br />States, or an incidence of about 2% of the<br />population per year. A study from England<br />(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2008-01-annual-<br />bone-fracture-percent-previous.html) suggests that<br />the rate of fracture is twice as high for people<br />in the age group we're considering, so let's<br />say 4% per year. That's about 1% per 3 months<br />(September - November). If each member of the 17-<br />person class (including me, but assuming that at<br />least one person never shows up) has a 1% chance<br />of breaking a bone, then the chance that *no one*<br />breaks a bone is 0.99^17, or about 84.3%. The<br />chance that at least one person breaks a bone is<br />100 minus that.","Jeremy Lee (85%): 1. UGA is coming off of a<br />dominant championship season 2. UGA football is<br />the best in the nation","Jeremy Lee (15%): 1. It’s been very hot in GA<br />recently 2. Each year, it’s been getting hotter","Jeremy Lee (30%): 1. A lot of people play sports<br />so there is a good chance someone could break a<br />bone 2. I think that breaking bones isn’t that<br />common as an injury","David Barrero (85%): UGA is the reigning National<br />Champion and only lost one game last year while<br />Oregon lost three of their last five games the<br />previous season. UGA was also ranked #3 in best<br />recruiting classes of 2022 while Oregon was ranked<br />#13.","David Barrero (70%): In 2021, the temperature<br />in Athens fell below 62 degrees Fahrenheit<br />about 5 times during the month of September. The<br />probability is lower this year because of global<br />warming and the rise in the average temperatures<br />every year.","David Barrero (35%): As people reach their young<br />adult stage they are less likely to break a bone<br />because their bone mass is denser. The probability<br />is higher because a lot of students in our class<br />do play sports which increases the chance that<br />someone in the class will break a bone.","Arianna Ycaza (90%): The game is in Atlanta, there<br />will be many more UGA fans than Oregon fans there<br />which will rally up the dawgs.","Arianna Ycaza (40%): I think it will happen early<br />morning or at overnight between now and the end of<br />September, but not soon and not during the day.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): We have a lot of recreational<br />athletes in this class, but I don't believe we<br />have any UGA athletes. Because of this, it is safe<br />to say that we do not have too many people with<br />time to do activities such as sports to risk a<br />bone break.","Hannah Jones (90%): The University of Georgia<br />athletic teams are part of the south-eastern<br />conference (SEC) which is the strongest conference<br />in the nation compared to any other. The<br />University of Georgia also has signed more 5-star<br />recruits than any other football team in the past<br />five years, making them overall stronger than any<br />other team. This leads me to believe UGA will win<br />against Oregon.","Hannah Jones (55%): Georgia weather is highly non-<br />reliable and constantly changing from one end of<br />the spectrum to another. Some days are 85 with<br />others going all the way down to 60. Because of<br />this i believe there is a fair chance that at<br />least one day will fall under 62. Georgia weather<br />also sees a lot of rain, with rainy skies comes<br />lower temperatures. Leading me to believe there is<br />a slight but very possible chance that the weather<br />could fall under 62.","Hannah Jones (20%): It is very rare to see someone<br />on campus with a cast on because they broke a<br />bone. With all the classes at UGA, I find it very<br />unlikely that one of the smallest classes such as<br />ours (around 15-20 people) would have someone with<br />a broken bone. I also think that there may be some<br />sort of injury but not to the extent of breaking.<br />Breaking a bone would mean a serious hit was<br />taken. Leading me to believe there is a very low<br />chance of someone in our class breaking a bone.","Mac Kinnebrew (85%): The spread of this game is<br />-17 in Georgia's favor so they are highly favored.<br />This game is also in Atlanta which is much closer<br />to Athens than Eugene, Oregon, giving Georgia<br />heavy home field advantage.","Mac Kinnebrew (90%): I think this because over<br />this history of weather being recorded here the<br />average low is around 60 in the last week of<br />September. Last year there were around 10 days<br />that the temp dipped below 62 so it is highly<br />likely to happen this year.","Mac Kinnebrew (20%): We have 17 people in our<br />class so I think there is a low chance someone<br />breaks something. I do think there is a chance<br />though because a lot goes on in college and freak<br />accidents do happen.","Ian Driggers (75%): I think that UGA is a better<br />football team that Oregon but I am not 100%<br />confident. Football is a sport and like any sport,<br />anything can happen on any given day.","Ian Driggers (60%): I haven’t lived in athens<br />very long but I think that it will drop below 62°<br />Fahrenheit by September 31st.

But if I were to guess, I do know the<br />publicity might be the motive.","Joe Kennedy (41%): ESPN gives uga on average, a<br />93% to win each game. However, since there is a<br />93% change to win each game 12 different times,<br />we must raise .93 to the 12th power to get our<br />probability which is 41%","Joe Kennedy (65%): Georgia is one of the cheapest<br />states for gasoline, as as the supply for gas<br />has began to increase again, I would say a drop<br />in twenty cents in 8 and a half weeks is pretty<br />likely. This considers how gas prices have dropped<br />25 cents in two weeks in Athens, GA. However,<br />something like Russia v Ukraine could happen again<br />and limit supply of gasoline.","Joe Kennedy (100%): Yes it abs already happened as<br />of August 30, 2022, his approval rating hit 44%,<br />the highest of the year.","Joe Kennedy (5%): This is very unlikely due<br />to Kanye’s song “heartless”, where in the song<br />he says “you run and tell you friends that you<br />leaving me / they say that they don’t see what<br />you see in me / you wait a couple months then you<br />goin’ see / you’ll never find nobody better than<br />me” and these lines reflect what just happened<br />with Kim and Kanye after Kim broke up with Pete.<br />I think Kanye’s ego is to big to take Kim back,<br />especially due to these lyrics he wrote and<br />released over 10 years ago.","Patrick Egan (34%): I found a website where some<br />guy simulated the 2022 CFB season 1,000 times.<br />In the 1,000 simulations he ran, UGA won 12/12<br />games in 340 of the 1000 simulations. Here's<br />the website: https://phenrickson.github.io/cfb/<br />team_profiles/preseason/2022/Georgia.html","Patrick Egan (1%): In the past week, the gas<br />price has dropped 4 cents. In 13 weeks, it will<br />be November 30th. It is unlikely the gas price<br />will be a constant 4 cents per week, but it is<br />definitely likely to keep dropping and now balance<br />out yet. However, it's like the drop will be<br />between 30-52 cents. Meaning I'm expecting the<br />price to be below $3.00 on November 30th, and<br />especially below $3.10. However I didn't put 0%<br />because I'd look very dumb if it ended up being<br />above $3.10.","Patrick Egan (50%): I wasn't sure what to answer,<br />so I decided to determine his approval rating<br />using the worst possible prediction method<br />possible: Asking strangers on Reddit. Only 6<br />responded, very helpful, internet. The responses<br />split 3-3.","Patrick Egan (0%): Kanye West will be too busy<br />planning his 2024 Presidential Election campaign<br />to even consider lending even a short moment<br />of his attention span over to Kim Kardashian.<br />Kim Kardashian will start October by dating a<br />multitude of men, including Drake, James Harden,<br />Pete Davidson again, Joe Ornstein, and Glen<br />Quagmire. However, on November 29th, Kim will run<br />up to Kanye and beg Kanye to get back together<br />with him, but before he can accept, he gets a call<br />from the Republican Party informing him that he<br />has already won the nomination for the Republican<br />ticket in the 2024 election, and decides that he<br />doesn't have time to date Kim and also win the<br />presidential election. They end up not getting<br />back together, and Kanye West ends up becoming<br />president, and he marries Pete Davidson instead.","Noah Herndon (90%): I give the dawgs a 95% chance<br />to go undefeated because we just beat the number<br />11 team in the nation 49-3 and they were supposed<br />to be our toughest opponent on the schedule.<br />After the ducks, the only teams that may give us<br />a problem in the first quarter are probably just<br />Tennessee, Kentucky, and Florida, but none of<br />those teams have a chance at beating us. We may<br />be a better team this year than last and that's<br />saying something. That was some of the best<br />offense I've ever seen out of the dawgs and our<br />defense just reloaded.","Noah Herndon (60%): I'm not too confident on the<br />probability of this one happening either, but I am<br />going to lean towards gas being higher than $3.10<br />because there is no telling what could happen in<br />the war in Ukraine and how that could affect gas<br />prices.","Noah Herndon (60%): I have no clue, so I'm going<br />to play it safe. I'll give it a 60% chance of it<br />being over 42% because he is currently over 42%<br />and the approval ratings don't drastically change<br />that much.","Noah Herndon (10%): Kanye can post on Instagram<br />and dog on Pete Davidson all he wants, but that<br />doesn't mean he is going to get back with Kim. I<br />think Kanye could've had a chance to get back, but<br />he's done too much damage to be able to win Kim<br />back over. I don't think the way you win your ex-<br />wife back over is posting private messages all<br />over social media.","Joe Ornstein (32%): Outside View: Since 2000,<br />there have been 5 out of 22 seasons where an SEC<br />team went undefeated (none of them UGA). This<br />suggests an \"optimism ceiling\" of about 23%. The<br />chance that Georgia goes undefeated should be less<br />than the chance that any SEC team goes undefeated.<br />Alternatively, if I thought that UGA had a 90%<br />of defeating Oregon, and has the same chance of<br />defeating each of the remaining 11 teams in its<br />regular season (optimistic), then its chance<br />of going undefeated is 90% x 90% x 90% .... 11<br />times, which is about 31%. Inside View: Georgia<br />is facing a pretty favorable set of teams in<br />the regular season this year. Arguably our most<br />challenging opponent is Tennessee. Consequently,<br />ESPN's statistical model gives UGA a 21% chance of<br />going undefeated (including the SEC champsionship,<br />presumably against Alabama), which suggests<br />roughly a 40% chance of going undefeated in the<br />regular season alone. I'll split the difference<br />between these two perspectives.","Joe Ornstein (15%): The 2022 rise in gas prices<br />was driven by a reduction in supply related to the<br />pandemic and Russian sanctions, plus resurgence<br />in demand since lows in early 2020. Oil production<br />is a long term investment, so it takes years to<br />bring new capacity online, but the trends are<br />towards increasing production plus decreasing<br />demand (owing to increasing fuel efficiency /<br />electric vehicles). It is most likely that gas<br />prices will decrease the rest of the year. But<br />will they decrease by 20 cents per gallon in 3<br />months? The national average price for regular gas<br />has decreased $1/gallon over the past 2 months,<br />so that's not an implausible rate of change.<br />Futures markets (a type of market where you can<br />buy, say, a barrel of crude oil for a certain<br />price a certain number of months from now) suggest<br />that regular gas will decrease by 51 cents during<br />the final quarter of 2022 (https://www.eia.gov/<br />outlooks/steo/report/prices.php) Of course,<br />there may be further supply disruptions: there<br />could be another pandemic, or an escalation in<br />the Ukraine-Russia War, or some other Black Swan<br />event that drives up oil prices again. Also, maybe<br />the Marathon outside of Russell Hall goes out of<br />business, and I'm not sure how we'll resolve the<br />question if that happens.","Joe Ornstein (75%): Outside View: There are 87<br />days between now and November 30. Between days<br />591 and 678, most presidents over the past 50<br />years have slightly improved their approval<br />numbers. (The exception is Bush 2, whose numbers<br />were artificially high post 9/11). Since Biden's<br />approval rating is currently above 42%, this<br />suggests a greater than even chance that it will<br />still be above 42% in three months. Generally,<br />presidential approval has become more stable<br />over time, as the electorate has polarized and<br />people tend to make up their minds about the<br />president early on. Large three month swings are<br />unlikely without a significant external event.<br />Inside View: Biden's approval rating lows over<br />the summer seemed pretty closely tied to concerns<br />about inflation, particularly gas prices. (There's<br />a weak, but significant relationship between<br />the price of gas and presidential job approval:<br />https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/<br />articles/gas-prices-and-presidential-approval/).<br />If I think there's an 85% chance of gas prices<br />going down significantly, then I should think<br />there's a similar chance of Biden's approval<br />rating staying where it is or inching higher.","Joe Ornstein (1%): Outside View: According to some<br />research, 10-15% of divorced couples eventually<br />reconcile. There is some evidence that celebrity<br />marriages are twice as likely to dissolve as<br />normies (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/<br />better-divorce/202206/why-many-divorced-partners-<br />remarry-each-other), and 3 months is a short time<br />window, so 10% seems like an upper bound. Inside<br />View: To help me with this question, I consulted<br />with an expert in the field of Kardashianism, my<br />wife Carly. She is a person who, let's say, keeps<br />up with the Kardashians. From this conversation,<br />I gather that Kimye's differences are<br />irreconcilable, and there is very little chance<br />that this will be one of those 10% of divorces<br />that get back together. At some point over the<br />next three months, Kim will do *something* to<br />get back on the public's radar, but it's unlikely<br />to be getting back with Kanye. I'll tack on one<br />percent because things happen.","Adam Szczupak (84%): The only games I think they<br />have a change to lose are Tennessee, Kentucky, and<br />Florida. Each of these games according to ESPN are<br />about 90% chance of Georgia winning. So all three<br />together (parlayed) imply a lower probability than<br />90, but still high.","Adam Szczupak (38%): Gasoline prices have<br />consistently been lowered over the last few<br />months, and I expect this trend to continue. The<br />uncertainty lies in to what extent.","Adam Szczupak (69%): Due to midterm elections in<br />early November, Biden will likely not say or pass<br />anything that would lower his party’s electability<br />or popularity.","Adam Szczupak (5%): Kim has never gotten back<br />together with an ex and Kanye has publicly been<br />shaming her for her actions with their children.<br />Although they were once married and would announce<br />it publicly rather soon.","Jeremy Lee (75%): After watching the Oregon game,<br />I can tell that UGA is a very dominant team - UGA<br />was undefeated in the regular season last year","Jeremy Lee (60%): - I honestly don't know because<br />the gas prices have been dropping, but they can<br />rise again - I think it will have to be above<br />$3.10 because of inflation","Jeremy Lee (75%): Biden's approval rating has been<br />increasing in the past 100 hundreds - The trend<br />from the other presidents has been increasing in<br />approval rating as they approach the 2nd year","Jeremy Lee (10%): - They seem to have a strong<br />disliking against each other now - They don't seem<br />to match each other's personalities","audrey vaughan (95%): all the teams they play in<br />the regular season they beat last year they had an<br />undefeated regular season last year","audrey vaughan (75%): although gas prices have<br />been dropping, its not very likely for it to drop<br />20 cents in 3 months inflation will probably not<br />get much better within the next 3 months.","audrey vaughan (85%): the previous presidents<br />stay pretty constant with their rating after the<br />2nd year, and he's at 42% right now, and it wont<br />be very likely for it to drop much lower based on<br />previous ratings. the population of republicans<br />and democrats are both around 40% and dont seem to<br />drop much lower than that.","audrey vaughan (5%): Kanye has brought their<br />relationship very public and bashed Kim several<br />times online, so because they've made everything<br />so public it would be harder for them to get back<br />together without Kim embarrassing herself. it's<br />been made very apparent that Kanye's relationship<br />with his children has gotten much worse and for<br />their sake I don't think Kim would get back with<br />him.","David Barrero (88%): If the SEC championship<br />does not count toward the regular season UGA will<br />go undefeated this regular season because their<br />schedule does not looks similar if not worse than<br />last year where they went undefeated. I give UGA<br />a 12% chance of not going undefeated because these<br />are young players which mean more mistakes can<br />take place and sports can be a very volatile when<br />trying to give predictions.","David Barrero (65%): Not much information to<br />gather and make a confident forecast, but usually<br />during the winter gas prices tend to drop which<br />is why the probability is low. I don't believe it<br />will fall as much as $3.10 because gas prices have<br />been very high this year and will continue to be<br />for the rest of the year","David Barrero (90%): Since January 2021 Biden's<br />approval rating fell under 42% in about three<br />or four of the months during that time span. The<br />November midterms could bring it under 42% by<br />making everything more divisive.","David Barrero (5%): I haven't seen any evidence<br />to show that either party are moving towards<br />reconciling with each other. Kanye continues to<br />post random stuff on his Instagram while having<br />internet \"beef\" with Pete Davidson who is Kim's ex<br />now.","Hannah Jones (85%): UGA will play teams ranked<br />much lower than them in the SEC. These teams<br />include: Missouri, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt. Even<br />the teams ranked a little higher do not stand a<br />chance against UGA's defense. UGA also has much<br />more 5 stars and returning strong players from<br />years before. Many of these players obtain a<br />major part in the offensive side of the team. The<br />only thing I can say to pose the opposite opinion<br />is that sports is very dependant on the actions<br />within the game. UGA could lose to any of these<br />teams solely because of a bad game, which is why<br />i put 85% of winning instead of 100%. But, UGA has<br />the potential to go undefeated this season.","Hannah Jones (70%): Gas will only continue to<br />increase due to competitors having to constantly<br />raise their prices. Not only that but it will be<br />football season in Athens which means gas will<br />be particularly high for a while to gain as much<br />money as possible. I think the price will stay<br />around $3.49 or definitely above $3.10. Football<br />season is prime time to make as much profit as<br />possible especially for home games when so many<br />fans travel.","Hannah Jones (55%): Currently (two months before),<br />it is 42.8% approve. I believe this means he<br />has rather a very good chance of that increasing<br />above 42% very easily by November 30th. I believe<br />this will also have a lot to do with the current<br />elections upcoming. Not only that, but looking at<br />the graph is shows that Biden's approval has only<br />increasingly gone up since July, which gives a<br />strong hint that it will continue to grow.","Hannah Jones (50%): Kanye will most likely<br />come out with an album before he gets back<br />together with Kim. This would be the perfect<br />publicity stunt. I believe after the album has<br />been successful, him and Kim will then publicly<br />announce that they are back together. Yet, knowing<br />how dramatic KIm and Kanye are, the chance of them<br />announcing they are back together before November<br />30th is still majorly possible. This makes my<br />prediction an even 50/50 because with these two A-<br />list celebrities, you really cannot say.","Andrew Decker (50%): I think UGA looked very<br />strong in its first game against Oregon. I would<br />say that the only challenge to UGA this season are<br />is UTK.

However, as of September 13, 2022, the<br />Georgia senate polls has Herschel walker trending<br />down while Raphael Warnock trending up. Although<br />it is close, I will say Warnock will receive more<br />votes.","Joseph Kennedy (65%): I think don't worry darling<br />will most likely reach $500 million in box office<br />revenue by November 23rd for the reason that<br />Harry Styles is in it and due to other 2022 movies<br />trends in the box office. To start, it took \"Top<br />Gun: Maverick\" 1 month to reach $500 million<br />dollars in the box office, so if you give a movie<br />that has similar hype going into it twice as long<br />to reach the same box office total, I would think<br />that this could happen. This movie containing<br />Harry Styles makes it seem to have a large box<br />office with his insane amount of fans, so I think<br />that this is likely to happen.","Joseph Kennedy (35%): According to DraftKings, the<br />braves have a 27% chance to win the division, and<br />I think I agree with them. Even though I believe<br />the Braves are a better team, they started to<br />many games back of the Mets at the start of the<br />season and that made them play catch up towards<br />the end of the season. To add, the Mets have a<br />significantly easier remaining schedule as they<br />host the pirates and marlins, and take a trip to<br />Oakland. Although the braves play the nationals,<br />they also have two series' with the Phillies, a<br />team in the playoff hunt, and with the giants,<br />another team hoping to make the playoffs. I think<br />with the +2 games the Mets have and the easier<br />schedule, they will most likely win the division<br />over the braves.","Joseph Kennedy (25%): I think tensions will<br />continue to settle down in the coming weeks, but<br />I do not think that a ceasefire will be declared<br />before 2023. I think that the situation is to<br />large for Russia to think of peace so soon after<br />starting something so crazy.","Joseph Kennedy (85%): According to forbs magazine<br />titled \"New Artemis I Launch Dates: NASA Refines<br />Launch Dates For Moon Mission\" released on<br />September 1, 2022, and then tweaked on September<br />13, 2022, the intended launch date is September<br />27, 2022. I would be sure NASA would be accurate<br />on when they decide to launch their spacecraft<br />especially since they publicly announced the date<br />twice. To add, if things do go wrong and the date<br />needs to be postponed from September 27, 2022,<br />I'm, sure it will not take longer than a month<br />more for the spacecraft to launch. But we truly<br />don't know NASA's struggles, but as of now, I<br />think a launch date before the end of the semester<br />seems likely.","Arianna Ycaza (60%): As of late August, The Hill<br />found that Walker has a 2 point lead on Warnock<br />based on a poll given to the general Georgia<br />public, however, the same poll shows that 53% of<br />Georgia voters expect Warnock to win.","Arianna Ycaza (35%): The opening weekend for<br />the film is projected to make in the high-teens<br />millions, and this is typically the weekend that<br />movies make the most money. In 2 months with each<br />weekend likely declining in box office revenue, it<br />is very unlikely that the box office revenue will<br />surpass $500million by November 23. Even if the<br />movie makes $19million for 8 weeks straight, the<br />box office revenue will not even make $200million<br />in that time frame.","Arianna Ycaza (40%): The Mets have more wins<br />overall despite the Braves having won more games<br />since June 1st.","Arianna Ycaza (20%): According to the Brookings<br />Institute, a cease-fire is unlikely due to the<br />fact that even that agreement would leave parts<br />of southern and eastern Ukraine occupied with no<br />guarantee that Russian intervention would cease.","Arianna Ycaza (85%): According to Nasa, the<br />projected launch was scheduled for September<br />3rd but could change to the 5th due to weather.<br />Considering this, it should have launched or will<br />launch as a resechedule in the weeks to come.","Edward Cox (20%): While he is more experienced<br />within the governmental side, Herschel Walker has<br />much more support even in the primary election<br />for each party. Unless more people go out and vote<br />or actually happen to care about possible abuse<br />accusations, it is likely that Walker will receive<br />more votes during the election.","Edward Cox (1%): After seeing the initial reviews,<br />people are going to loose interest and not want to<br />see it.","Edward Cox (25%): While it is possible, it may not<br />be likely.","Edward Cox (20%): Seeing how unstable Putin is and<br />how far he has come, it is very unlikely that he<br />will call a ceasefire with Ukraine. He is going to<br />keep pushing until he cannot anymore.","Edward Cox (75%): While they seem to keep pushing<br />the launch date back, I think there is enough time<br />for them to figure out their problems and what<br />they need to do before the end of our semester.","Mac Kinnebrew (45%): I chose a near 50/50<br />probability because this race is currently<br />projected to be very close and it could change<br />before the election happens. I do not think<br />Warnock will receive more votes because according<br />to fivethirtyeight Herschel is a slight favorite.","Mac Kinnebrew (30%): The Elvis movie is not yet at<br />500 million and Elvis is a much bigger name movie.<br />This movie also has a small target range of young<br />women and not as many less men.","Mac Kinnebrew (40%): The Mets are 1.5 games up<br />on the Braves right now so the Braves are already<br />behind. The Mets remaining schedule is also much<br />easier.","Mac Kinnebrew (25%): There are still many ongoing<br />invasions in Ukraine right now. This war has also<br />been going on for much longer than people thought<br />it would so it may not come to an end soon.","Mac Kinnebrew (80%): The projected launch is now<br />sept. 27 so there is plenty of time to delay and<br />still launch it before the end. It has also been<br />postponed many times so I don't see it being<br />pushed back a lot longer.","Adam Szczupak (67%): Incumbency advantage and I<br />think Perdue was a much stronger candidate than<br />Walker. Moreover, the demographics of Georgia have<br />only gotten more democratic leaning since then.","Adam Szczupak (21%): I haven’t heard of this<br />movie and I consider myself to be active with pop<br />culture; however, the fact that Harry styles is<br />in it significantly increased it’s odds because of<br />his huge fan base. Also, it has been a while since<br />a big movie came out. Odd time to release though,<br />as summer blockbusters usually gross more.","Adam Szczupak (32%): Although they are 0.5 games<br />ahead and in my opinion have the superior team<br />to the Mets, the Mets have a much easier schedule<br />down the stretch and have Jacob degrom and max<br />Scherzer to catalyst their consistent win rate as<br />opposed to the braves who are more streaky. Vegas<br />has their implied probability at 34%.","Adam Szczupak (15%): Russia is starting to get out<br />of the news and thus foreign condemnation, so they<br />would probably rather have the Ukrainian resources<br />than attempt to alieviate any issues with the west","Adam Szczupak (84%): They are set to launch, they<br />are just looking for a good launch window, which<br />I think is extremely likely to open up before<br />November 30th. Mechanical issues is why i put it<br />as an 84% chance, because stuff like that always<br />can delay launches or things of that nature.","Patrick Egan (62%): The race is incredibly close,<br />however I'm giving Warnock the edge because both<br />Warnock and Walker have agreed to have a debate<br />in mid October, and I think a debate will greatly<br />benefit Warnock's chances of winning.","Patrick Egan (1%): In 2022, there have been 7<br />movies that have grossed more than $500 million.<br />One of those was only released in China so I'm<br />ignoring it. However, the 6 worldwide movies that<br />grossed over 500 Million were all part of pre-<br />existing franchises. Top Gun, Jurassic World,<br />Doctor Strange, Minions, The Batman, and Thor.<br />All pre-existing series. Two other movies that<br />fell just short were the new Fantastic Beasts and<br />Sonic 2. The point is that Movies that aren't part<br />of already established series don't seem to make<br />it close to the $500 million mark. If we were to<br />find the highest movies that stem from a previous<br />movie, we'd find Uncharted and Elvis, which<br />made a respectable 400M and 250M, respectively.<br />However, those still come from pre-existing<br />names, with Uncharted starting out as a massively<br />popular Video Game franchise and Elvis, which is<br />Elvis. The highest grossing, completely original<br />movie (which is a movie that's not based off of<br />something else, or by some company like Disney<br />or Marvel that just always gets a lot of people<br />to watch) was Bullet Train. Bullet Train did not<br />even make $200M. The same research holds true for<br />2021, where the highest grossing original film was<br />Free Guy with only 331M. In fact, you would have<br />to go all the way back to 2017 to find a movie<br />which grossed over 500M that wasn't based off of<br />some pre-existing property. That movie was The<br />Boss Baby it barely passed with 525M. In order for<br />Don't Worry Darling to gross more than $500M in<br />box office revenue, it would have to do something<br />that hasn't been done in over 5 years by the Boss<br />Baby. The only way I can see Don't Worry Darling<br />passing 500M is if they replace Harry Styles with<br />a baby in a suit.","Patrick Egan (49%): The race between the Braves<br />and the Mets is so neck and neck that I could<br />easily see it going either way. It's 49 instead of<br />50 because at the time of this prediction the Mets<br />hold a 1 game lead.","Patrick Egan (7%): UN Secretary-General António<br />Guterres said on 9/15 he feels a peace deal to<br />end the war in Ukraine isn't close. “We are far<br />away from the end of the war,\" he told reporters<br />following a call with Russian President Vladimir<br />Putin. \"A ceasefire is not in sight,” he said,<br />adding, \"I would be lying if I said it would<br />happen.”","Patrick Egan (75%): NASA now says the potential<br />launch dates for Artemis 1 are September 27, with<br />a backup of October 2 now under review. If they<br />can't launch it in these days then I will be very<br />concerned.","Ian Driggers (75%): Warnock is ahead in the polls<br />right now so I am going to stick with that.","Ian Driggers (50%): I have no idea either way.","Ian Driggers (60%): I think the braves have a good<br />chance of winning but I am not sure.","Ian Driggers (20%): Russia is not going to comply<br />with Ukraines wishes","Ian Driggers (95%): It is predicted to launch on<br />sept 27th so I think that if it doesn’t, there is<br />enough time to launch before Nov 30th","Nicholas Chao (60%): I think this will happen<br />because Georgia is on track to continuing on<br />becoming a swing state and lean towards the<br />democratic side. As of now even though Walker is<br />up in a very thin margin, I still believe these<br />swing states will all lean towards Warnock.","Nicholas Chao (0%): I do not thing this will<br />happen because the most recent reviews on the<br />movie are pretty negative in itself. This movie<br />also had a low budget, making it reaching 500<br />million very difficult.","Nicholas Chao (75%): I believe that coming off<br />a world series definitely makes the Braves a<br />contender for that title again. It will be still<br />tough to beat other teams such as the Astros and<br />Dodgers, but I think for our own division, we can<br />pull through.","Nicholas Chao (20%): Events along the war are<br />moving very slow and do not seem they are in the<br />direction of ending the war. Some sources say that<br />a ceasefire may just cause the war to be longer.<br />As of now, the war does not seem to be ending<br />soon.","Nicholas Chao (100%): It is launching September<br />27th. This would make it by the end of the<br />semester. The mission will take 38 days, even<br />ending the mission before the end of the semester.","Jeremy Lee (75%): - Because GA was a blue state<br />in 2020, I think there is a good chance that they<br />will vote for a democratic senator - Warnock's<br />popularity seems to be increasing while Walker's<br />is still below Walker's","Jeremy Lee (10%): - Many movies don't make more<br />than $500 million in box revenue within 1 month,<br />and those that do are extremely popular - The<br />movie is rated R, so the audience will be much<br />smaller than other movies that have been able to","Jeremy Lee (100%): - IM RISKING IT FOR THE BISCUIT<br />I LOVE THE BRAVES - The braves have been really<br />strong this season and only have the Mets as their<br />contender who they have beat multiple times","Jeremy Lee (30%): - It doesn't seem like the war<br />will be coming to an end any time soon - If the<br />war does reach to lasting for 1 year, on average<br />only 20% of those wars will end in a ceasefire","Jeremy Lee (100%): - NASA states that they will be<br />launching Artemis I on September 27 - No way NASA<br />doesn't launch Artemis on the date they stated","Noah Herndon (60%): This one is really hard to<br />predict because Walker is not very bright and fit<br />for the job but is also Trump-endorsed and the<br />greatest running back of all time which holds a<br />lot of weight around here. Ultimately, I think<br />Walker and Warnock's debate on October 14th will<br />sway a decent amount of votes towards Warnock<br />giving him the win.","Noah Herndon (10%): $500 million is a lot of<br />money for a movie that had a 20-30 million dollar<br />budget. I have a really hard time seeing this<br />movie make that much. It would have to be a<br />massive hit, and I think there is just too much<br />controversy surrounding it for it to make that<br />much money.","Noah Herndon (40%): I watch baseball occasionally,<br />but I'm not really informed; therefore, I played<br />it safe. I gave the Braves a less than 50% chance<br />of winning the division only because they are<br />currently down by two games, so not only do they<br />need to win the rest of their games, they also<br />need the Mets to lose at least two games.","Noah Herndon (20%): Ukraine has said that they<br />aren't going to accept a ceasefire if it means<br />giving themselves up to Russia, and Russia isn't<br />going to stop till they get back Ukraine, so I<br />don't really see a ceasefire happening, especially<br />before November 30th.","Noah Herndon (50%): There were two scrubs within<br />one week which doesn't bode well for Artemis.<br />Whenever they extend the window for a new launch,<br />they have to make sure their new launch lines up<br />with the lunar cycle. So it's kind of a 50/50; it<br />could go either way.","Hannah Jones (45%): Currently, Walker is taking<br />the lead by 1.6%. The poll standings tell us a<br />lot about the future votes. Walker is also a fan<br />favorite for a lot of the population in Georgia<br />giving him a little bit higher advantage.","Hannah Jones (30%): People are not raving about<br />the movie and the reviews for the movie are not<br />amazing. Not only that but it is a thriller which<br />does not typically pull a major audience whereas<br />action/superhero does. This movie will make a good<br />amount of gross revenue but because of its bad<br />publicity and the type of movie it is, it will not<br />make that money by november 23rd.","Hannah Jones (63%): They are currently ranked 2 in<br />their division which shows a good chance. The team<br />is also stacked with players that are doing really<br />good including Swanson and Acuna. The braves are<br />also known to be full of surprises. No one thought<br />they would win the world series this past season<br />and they did. They have a good chance of winning<br />their division.","Hannah Jones (14%): This conflict is long<br />simmering and has the tension that it will not be<br />over for quite a while. Not only that but more and<br />more attacks are happening every single day. This<br />will go on for a while.","Hannah Jones (85%): They have already announced<br />two possible dates including september 30th<br />and october 2nd. Both of these dates are before<br />november 30th. Nasa typically always sticks with<br />their original dates too. Forbes posted this and<br />said it is essentially scheduled.","David Barrero (93%): Raphael Warnock is the<br />incumbent senator which will result in him gaining<br />reelection and thus getting more votes than<br />Herschel Walker. In the 2020 election the average<br />winning percentage throughout the states for<br />incumbents was 93% and for Congress it was 96%.","David Barrero (5%): Only two movies in 2022 had<br />a total gross over 500 million in 2022 which<br />were Top Gun and Spiderman: Now Way Home which<br />were two blockbusters of the year and they both<br />almost didn't reach the mark. There have also been<br />critics that have had early access to the movie<br />and the reviews have not been the best which may<br />deter the public to go watch the movie.","David Barrero (85%): The Braves will win the<br />division as they have one of the best records<br />following the All-Star Game and have continued<br />their hot streak for months. Having beat the Mets<br />in the last","David Barrero (10%): Instead of looking for peace<br />now, the president of Ukraine now believes that<br />the war can be won and is looking to continue to<br />fight this war until it is won. Many Ukrainians<br />want a cease-fire but only if the land that was<br />taken from their country is liberated which means<br />that they will continue fighting and no ceasefire<br />will happen soon.","David Barrero (95%): This mission was supposed to<br />launch on August 29th but because of some issues<br />it has been delayed till the 27th of September<br />which still is far from November 30th if there<br />are more delays. NASA would want to launch this<br />mission as soon as possible because it will look<br />bad for them if they continue delaying the launch.","Audrey Vaughan (53%): yes- out of 6 polls, Walker<br />was ahead in 3 and Warnock was ahead in 3. So<br />based on that they are about 50-50. Another<br />article says that Warnock is leading by 1.5%<br />margin of error, so once again this isn't a<br />very large amount to be ahead by. 4 days ago, an<br />article said that 52% of Georgia voters support<br />Warnock.","Audrey Vaughan (20%): Although Harry styles<br />is very popular, the rotten tomato rating was<br />a 36% which is pretty bad. Many people really<br />rely on rotten tomato so I think that will make<br />many people not see it. The critic reviews that<br />have come out give bad reviews so that will also<br />prevent a lot of people from seeing it.","Audrey Vaughan (85%): In order for the braves to<br />win their division, the Mets have to loose their<br />next game. It's between those two teams so they<br />have a pretty good chance of winning. The braves<br />have also won 5 years in a row.","Audrey Vaughan (5%): one way a ceasefire could be<br />declared would be for other parties to enter the<br />war. This includes NATO/ china. The likelihood of<br />all parties of NATO joining is already very low,<br />and even if they did join it would take a while<br />for Russia to actually call an end to the war.<br />Along with this, the Russian government has a<br />very isolated leader who wont call for a ceasefire<br />unless he absolutely has too.","Audrey Vaughan (85%): NASA says that there are<br />37 launch opportunities between now and November<br />30. That being said, they will most likely launch<br />during that time. They have already started<br />the prelaunch tests so they should be ready to<br />actually launch soon.","Olivia West (50%): I think that there is a<br />50-50 chance that Warnock will receive more<br />votes than Walker, considering the results of a<br />\"voter likeliness\" poll. According to Quinnipiac<br />University, Warnock slightly leads Walker in the<br />poll, resulting in 52% - 46% likeliness of the<br />candidates. With this, it leads to a very close<br />call in who will win the election, considering the<br />results only ranged 6%.","Olivia West (60%): Considering the movie \"Don't<br />Worry Darling\" stars famous celebrities such as<br />Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde, I think it has a<br />fairly high chance that will gross $500 million in<br />box office revenue before November 23rd. According<br />to the New York Times, surveys were taken from<br />consumers in regards to their interest in seeing<br />the movie, and the results conducted that \"Don't<br />Worry Darling\" is expected to receive $20 million<br />in revenue on opening night. The only doubts I<br />would have are considering the movie received<br />only 35% on rotten tomatoes, making my probability<br />slightly lower.","Olivia West (50%): For this scenario, I think that<br />there is a 50-50 chance that the braves will win<br />their division. Considering that they're on a 4<br />game winning streak and their one game back of the<br />New York Mets, they show that they have a fairly<br />competitive team. Looking at the record of the New<br />York Mets, they also have a similar winning streak<br />and overall competitiveness, making it an even<br />game for the Braves to win their division.","Olivia West (10%): Considering that the Russia<br />- Ukraine war has been ongoing for the past 6<br />months, I don't think any side will ceasefire<br />anytime soon. Russia was generally believed to<br />be preparing to quickly remove Ukraine's pro-<br />Western government, but expectations quickly<br />escalated into a bloody conflict that resulted in<br />significant destruction and casualties, further<br />lowering the possibilities that Russia or Ukraine<br />will give up after going this far.","Olivia West (60%): According to NASA, Artemis I is<br />scheduled to launch on September 27, 2022, making<br />the possibility fairly high that it will remain on<br />this schedule. Considering there were a few delays<br />from the failed launch attempts in August and<br />early September, it makes the probability lower<br />that the launch will actually follow through this<br />time.","Andrew Decker (60%): As of the 20th, the rcp polls<br />have to race at a tie. I would say the Warnock<br />has an advantage as he is an incumbent but I could<br />see Herschel winning too. I think the way this<br />election comes out is going to reflect how the<br />national elections turn out too.","Andrew Decker (20%): I admittedly don't know about<br />the movie much or the movie industry. I think<br />grossing 500 million in 2 months is pretty tough<br />for a movie that I barely know about. I looked<br />at the recent Spiderman No Way Home movie which<br />grossed around 760 million in two months. For<br />a Spiderman movie to gross 760 in two months, I<br />think gives this movie a low chance to make 500<br />million.","Andrew Decker (30%): As of today the Braves are<br />back 2 games. As much as I want the braves to<br />win the division, I think the Mets have an easier<br />schedule remaining than the Braves. The Mets play<br />the Brewers(decent team), A's (horrible), Marlins<br />(bad), the Braves, and the Nats (bad). The Braves<br />play the Nats (bad), Phillies (good), Mets, and<br />the Marlins(bad). I think that if the Braves want<br />to win their division, they have to win both the<br />Mets and Phillies series. I think overall that the<br />Mets have a better chance at winning the division.","Andrew Decker (20%): I think the war in Ukraine<br />is not close to being over. I think the Russians<br />will keep occupying part of Ukraine. I see the<br />war being similar to the war in the middle east<br />where it is an ongoing conflict. Putin recently<br />said that there is no plans for him to stop the<br />invasion. They recently discovered a mass grave<br />site. In light of both recent revelations, I think<br />the war will still be going on in two months.","Andrew Decker (100%): According to Nasa, they are<br />planning to launch on Sept 27. Even if the launch<br />is delayed, I couldn't imagine them delaying<br />it for 2 months at this stage in the process.<br />Although the administrator of Nasa said that they<br />are in no rush, I believe that they will try to<br />get the rocket off by Nov 30.","Joe Ornstein (55%): The most recent polls of this<br />race are pretty mixed. About half show Warnock<br />with a substantial lead, and half show Walker with<br />a slight lead. Over the past six years, polls of<br />races like these have been slightly biased towards<br />Democrats, as Republicans have, for one reason<br />or another, become less willing to talk with<br />pollsters. The polling firms have made efforts<br />to deal with this, but between a possible bias<br />towards Democrats, and the high variance of state-<br />level polls, I'd say there's a lot of uncertainty<br />in this race. Both the 538 poll-based models and<br />prediction markets like Predictit and Metaculus<br />put Warnock at a 55% chance of winning right now,<br />so that's what I'm going with.","Joe Ornstein (5%): Pre-pandemic, there were plenty<br />of movies that topped a billion in worldwide box<br />office revenue each year. But in 2022, there have<br />so far been only 7 movies that have grossed over<br />$500 million. Each one of them is a big budget<br />(>$100 million) movie like Top Gun Maverick or<br />Jurassic World Dominion. (The sole exception is<br />Minions: Rise of Gru, which has grossed about<br />$900 million on a budget of $80 million.) For<br />comparison, Don't Worry Darling has a budget of<br />around $20-35 million, so exceeding $500 million<br />would be wildly successful. I suspect it will<br />gross less than $200 million - movies with a<br />comparable budget that were box office *successes*<br />this year include Where the Crawdads Sing ($130<br />million gross) and Scream ($140 million gross).","Joe Ornstein (35%): The Braves and the Mets are<br />two of the best teams in the MLB this year, and<br />right now the Braves are two games behind the<br />Mets to win NL East. There are 15 games left in<br />the regular season, and by my reckoning the Mets<br />have an weaker set of teams left to play in their<br />schedule than the Braves (Oakland and Milwaukee<br />compared to Philly and Washington). The Vegas<br />moneyline right now puts the Mets at roughly 2-<br />to-1 odds of winning NL East.","Joe Ornstein (10%): A lot changed since we posted<br />this question - the Ukrainian counteroffensive<br />in Kharkiv raised my estimation that Ukraine<br />could successfully retake its territory and force<br />a Russian withdrawal. That said, retaking the<br />Donbas region is likely to be more difficult, and<br />I don't expect Ukraine to outright win the war<br />over the next two months. In fact, Putin's losses<br />raise the probability of more dangerous forms of<br />escalation. Ultimately, the chance of a negotiated<br />settlement depends entirely on Putin, and I don't<br />expect him to come to the table unless he thought<br />he was in danger of losing power (or he did lose<br />power and his successor negotiated a ceasefire).<br />Such unexpected shifts are possible, but unlikely.<br />(For reasons we will discuss in a few weeks,<br />experts are nearly always surprised by major power<br />transitions in autocracies.)","Joe Ornstein (85%): Because Artemis I is going<br />to the moon, there are only a certain number of<br />\"launch windows\" when the moon's orbit will be<br />in the right place. They are being tremendously<br />cautious, having already scrubbed two missions due<br />to faulty sensors and leaky valves. But there are,<br />as best as I can tell, still three launch windows<br />remaining before the end of the semester. Even if<br />NASA scrubs 50% of its missions (a number of found<br />thrown out on some website), three launch windows<br />means a 87.5% chance that Artemis will launch<br />during one of those windows."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.66929133858268,"symbol":"circle","line":{"width":1.88976377952756,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.4,5.6],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.88976377952756,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.2283105022831,"r":7.30593607305936,"b":40.1826484018265,"l":157.077625570776},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.05,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.65296803652968,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.4,5.6],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will a ceasefire be<br />declared in the Russia-<br />Ukraine War between now<br />and November 30th?","Will Dont Worry Darling<br />gross more than $500<br />million in box office<br />revenue by November 23rd?","Will Raphael Warnock<br />receive more votes than<br />Herschel Walker in the<br />November 8 US Senate<br />election?","Will the Atlanta Braves<br />win their division?","Will the NASA Artemis<br />I mission launch before<br />the end of the semester<br />(November 30)?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3,4,5],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will a ceasefire be<br />declared in the Russia-<br />Ukraine War between now<br />and November 30th?","Will Dont Worry Darling<br />gross more than $500<br />million in box office<br />revenue by November 23rd?","Will Raphael Warnock<br />receive more votes than<br />Herschel Walker in the<br />November 8 US Senate<br />election?","Will the Atlanta Braves<br />win their division?","Will the NASA Artemis<br />I mission launch before<br />the end of the semester<br />(November 30)?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.65296803652968,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"384c2706239f":{"x":{},"y":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"384c1bf45a1b":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"384c2706239f","visdat":{"384c2706239f":["function (y) ","x"],"384c1bf45a1b":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.2,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Democrats have also<br />held the majority of the House of Representatives<br />since January 3rd 2019.","Meredith Stevens (75%): She has a long history of<br />dancing experience so this is not something new or<br />difficult for her. She also has a large fan base<br />that will be rooting for her when it comes down to<br />vote.","Meredith Stevens (60%): If has been steadily<br />decreasing. Right now it is at 8.26% down from<br />8.52% in July. So it decreased .26% in a few<br />months so it is moving very slowly. Therefore, it<br />may take a few months to be below 8%","Meredith Stevens (65%): If it is as good as<br />the last one yes but sequels are sometimes hard<br />to live up to the audiences expectations. The<br />original lead actor is not in this film due to his<br />passing so this causes for a different lead role.<br />The new lead actor may not be as large of a crowd<br />favorite as the original black panther was.","Meredith Stevens (25%): I think the US eventually<br />will re-join the Iran nuclear deal but it won’t<br />be by November 30. The process of re-joining the<br />steel is a very complicated and long process and<br />is continuing to be up for debate. Biden wants to<br />rejoin the deal but only if I ran comes back into<br />compliance.","Joseph kennedy (40%): Over the previous years,<br />the house has typically sided with the political<br />party of the president. Even tho the house of<br />representitives race has a large group of toss<br />up seats, I think that the house will likley sit<br />democratic.","Joseph kennedy (65%): I do not know much about<br />dancing with the stars, but I do know that charlie<br />damelio is significantly more famous than the<br />other people on the list. To add, she already can<br />dance a bit, which I think can help her in the<br />end.","Joseph kennedy (100%): If I read this question<br />correctly, the inflation rate of September 2022<br />according to multiple sources was 8.3%. As we are<br />in september 2022 currently, I think it's 100%<br />positive that this will happen.","Joseph kennedy (65%): There are 16/29 marvel<br />movies that have a minumum rotten tomatoes score<br />of 85%. It is a 50-50 shot that this movie will<br />be higher than 85% on rotton tomatoes. However,<br />what is leading me towards the \"yes\" side is that<br />fact that the marvel movie with the highest rottom<br />tomateos score is the og black panther, so I think<br />fans and critics will both like this movie too.","Joseph kennedy (25%): Accoridng to many news<br />articles on this topic, almost all of them agree<br />that the US will not join the nuclear deal.<br />Although I am basing this decesion off the publics<br />opinion, I think I can agree it's not very likley<br />the US will get in on this deal.","Jeremy Lee (90%): - Often during the midterm<br />elections, the opposite party of the president<br />takes over the House - Past trends have shown that<br />the opposite party usually control the House","Jeremy Lee (85%): - Charli D'Amelio is well known<br />on TikTok because of her dancing - She has a large<br />fan base so she will most likely be able to get a<br />lot of votes","Jeremy Lee (65%): - It's hard to say because the<br />past trends show that after a peak of inflation,<br />the inflation rate either drops drastically after<br />a couple months or very slowly - The inflation<br />rate has been dropping around 0.5 each month since<br />the peak of inflation in June","Jeremy Lee (80%): - Black Panther Wakanda Forever<br />has high anticipation and believe a lot of people<br />will like the movie especially since the first one<br />was so successful - The director of the movie, 5<br />out of 7 of his movies have been 85% or higher on<br />rotten tomato score, one of them being the first<br />Black Panther","Jeremy Lee (20%): - Since the midterm elections<br />are coming up, Biden won't do anything that could<br />change the course for the democratic party -<br />Although both countries want to rejoin the deal,<br />neither of them have been taking any actions to<br />make it happen","Patrick Egan (79%): FiveThirtyEight said there was<br />a 69% chance, and I added 10 because the current<br />president is Democratic and usually the opposite<br />party does better in these types of elections.","Patrick Egan (16%): I have never seen dancing with<br />the stars. Looking at the list of competitors and<br />what people have to say about them, it appears<br />only 6 dancers have a chance of winning, 1 of<br />which being Charli. So she gets a 1/6 chance I<br />guess.","Patrick Egan (30%): The 10 year yield rate<br />continues to rise, but relative to the historical<br />relationship with core consumer inflation, the<br />current 10 year yield rate still looks low, which<br />implies 1) inflation will fall, 2) the 10 year<br />yield will rise, or 3) a bit of both. I'm hoping<br />for both I guess.","Patrick Egan (85%): The new Doctor Strange<br />apparently got an 85% or Rotten Tomatoes, so I<br />guess anything is possible...","Patrick Egan (30%): Both the US and Iran claim to<br />be interested, but they have struggled to reach an<br />agreement. Due to recent protests and civil unrest<br />in Iran, I don't believe a plan will come to be by<br />the end of the semester.","David Barrero (65%): The President's party in most<br />midterms loses the most seats and it seems to be<br />projected the same this year, but there has been<br />a decrease separation in the polls making it a<br />bit more close. There also have been redistricting<br />which have taken democrats out of some seats.","David Barrero (70%): Charli D'Amelio seems to<br />be one of the favorites to win Dancing with the<br />Stars. Her dancing background along with her fame<br />on tiktok has her moved up in the power rankings<br />for either a top challenger or favorite to win it<br />all. Her partner is also very well liked and has a<br />lot of experience and skill.","David Barrero (40%): The US inflation rate has<br />been greater than 8% for the past 6 months but<br />in the previous 4 months the inflation rate has<br />started to fall with an average of about .35 %<br />and the inflation rate is usually under 8%. The<br />inflation rate for August was about 8.3-8.26%<br />which means if it drops around .35% the inflation<br />rate will be under 8%","David Barrero (85%): The new Black Panther<br />will get an audience score above 85% because it<br />has been in the works for a long time and the<br />anticipation for the movie has been very high.<br />The recent passing of Chadwick Boseman will have<br />a huge impact as this movie is going to honor<br />him and he was a huge inspiration for many people<br />as well as being well liked. Comparing it to big<br />action movies the audience scores have been high<br />this year and are usually higher than the rotten<br />tomato scores.","David Barrero (5%): There have been talks about<br />the Iran Nuclear Deal since April of last year<br />and yet no consensus has been agreed upon. During<br />this time for the rest of the semester there is an<br />increase in focus on the midterms which will most<br />likely slow down the already slow talks about the<br />US rejoining the deal. The President and his party<br />might also not want to have made a decision until<br />after the elections for there not to have any<br />consequences on the party of the President. This<br />leaves little time for the deal to be discussed<br />about and resolved.","Joe Ornstein (80%): The president's party has<br />lost House seats in every midterm except one since<br />WWII. The exception was after 9/11, when GWB's<br />approval ratings were in the mid-60s. (Biden is<br />in no such position.) Given Democrats' razor thin<br />margins in the House, they cannot afford to lose<br />more than a handful of seats without losing the<br />majority. I'm only moderating my near-certainty of<br />a GOP majority because poll aggregators like 538<br />and prediction markets like PredictIt are posting<br />odds between 70-78%. Perhaps the backlash to<br />SCOTUS decisions is enough to mobilize Democratic<br />voters and save all those seats, but I strongly<br />doubt it.","Joe Ornstein (56%): As an Elder Millennial, I'm<br />pretty baffled by TikTok influencers, but my<br />impression from watching some Charli videos is<br />that she can, in fact, dance. This puts her at<br />an advantage over many of the other stars cast on<br />DWTS. In the first two episodes, Charli and Mark<br />scored higher than any other pair, which turns out<br />to be a pretty predictive indicator of success!<br />Over the past 30 seasons of the show, the eventual<br />winner was the Weeks 1+2 leader 56% of the time.<br />Also, Charli's partner is Mark Ballas, a two-time<br />winner of the mirror ball. The only pro with more<br />1st place wins is Derek Hough, who is a judge this<br />season.","Joe Ornstein (35%): I suspect it will be lower<br />this month than last month, but I don't hold this<br />belief very strongly. With gas prices decreasing,<br />and home prices leveling out amid recession fears,<br />the largest components of the CPI are set to bring<br />down the headline inflation rate. Economists'<br />forecasts are optimistic about the coming month's<br />inflation numbers. But they were optimistic about<br />last month's numbers too, so I'm not sure what to<br />think about that.","Joe Ornstein (25%): Looking at the Marvel<br />Cinematic Universe sequels, only 2/8 had a<br />higher Rotten Tomatoes audience score than the<br />first film. Pleasing fans with sequels is tough,<br />especially if the first movie was as well-<br />received as Black Panther. On top of that you have<br />the tragic loss of Chadwick Boseman, who really<br />powered the first film. While it's certainly<br />possible that Wakanda Forever will win over more<br />fans than the original, I wouldn't bet on it.","Joe Ornstein (10%): Once again, a situation that<br />has changed dramatically since we posted the<br />question. Even before the latest protests, there<br />was little sign that US and Iranian diplomats<br />were engaging constructively on this question, and<br />now that the Iranian regime is shooting civilians<br />in the streets I give a 0% chance that the Biden<br />administration lifts sanctions by December. The<br />only way I see this question resolving to Yes is<br />if the protests result in the Islamic Republic's<br />collapse, and the Biden administration lifts<br />sanctions on an interim government. That's a<br />pretty quick timeline, though.","Arianna Ycaza (60%): The midterm elections tend<br />to be when the popularity of the party of the<br />president sees a decline, since the current<br />president is a Democrat we can also expect for<br />more Republicans to vote and flip the house.<br />However, I have not seen any predictions that<br />express that Republicans are 100% going to flip<br />the house, so I only put it at a little over 50%.","Arianna Ycaza (50%): Last week on DWTS, Charli<br />D'Amelio and her partner got the highest points<br />out of all the couples. She's clearly doing very<br />well due to her knowledge of dance technique and<br />experience, however this is still an entertainment<br />program and I think viewers will not want to see<br />the expected winner (Charli) to win in the end.","Arianna Ycaza (20%): Based on the CPI for<br />September that was released and influence by<br />August 2022 data, the September U.S. inflation<br />rate is supposed to come in around 8.3%. However,<br />this data causes Seeking Alpha to predict that the<br />end of year inflation rate in the U.S. will end<br />up to be around 4%, which shows that the inflation<br />rate is going to be decreasing through September<br />and into December. This makes me think that the<br />inflation rate for September will come in at a<br />under 8%, even if it's 7.5%+.","Arianna Ycaza (95%): I think the movie will get<br />an audience score above 86% on Rotten Tomatoes<br />considering the original film brought in almost<br />a perfect audience approval score of 96%, as well<br />as over $700million in the box office. Marvel fans<br />are very loyal and I predict that the new Black<br />Panther movie will see similar ratings.","Arianna Ycaza (15%): No, because with the midterm<br />elections coming up in early November, Biden is<br />not likely to take action on the Iran Nuclear<br />Deal so that he is able to appeal to moderate<br />voters and Republicans who do not support the<br />Iran Nuclear Deal. If he were to rejoin the Iran<br />Nuclear Deal between the midterm election and<br />November 30, that would cause a lot of controversy<br />and would cause his ratings to plummet.","audrey vaughan (40%): Newsweek says that Democrats<br />are closing in on the lead that the GOP had<br />maintained with voters for several months and<br />a poll showed that Democrats have a nearly 1<br />point lead over Republicans. along with this, the<br />overturning of roe v wade will have a big impact<br />on this. Many people were very upset over this<br />and I believe it will encourage people to go and<br />vote and could result in the democrats having the<br />majority seats.","audrey vaughan (20%): although Charli D'Amelio<br />is a very famous person and has a background in<br />dancing, dancing with the stars is a show with<br />an older audience. That being said, chari is<br />more famous among a younger crowd that doesn't<br />watch the show that often. The shows winning is<br />voted on by the public and those watching, so if<br />the audience watching does know who she is, she<br />probably wont win. the style of dance that charli<br />has done before is very different from the dances<br />that they do on the show, so that will give her a<br />disadvantage because she will be trying to learn a<br />very different style.","audrey vaughan (80%): over the past 12 months<br />prior to August it has been above 8%, so there<br />is a very likely chance that this pattern will<br />continue. Although it has been high, it's been<br />starting to go down so theres a slight chance<br />that it will drop below 8%, but it's very unlikely<br />because of the state of our economy and rising<br />inflation over the past several months.","audrey vaughan (90%): the first black panther<br />movie got a 96 on rotten tomato's was was<br />extremely popular and good so i believe that it<br />will. along with this, the new movie is produced<br />by the same director and has many of the same<br />starring actors.","audrey vaughan (55%): Mohammad Morandi, the<br />Iranian team negotiating team adviser, said in<br />august that they are closer than they've been<br />before to securing a deal with the US. Biden<br />has also sought to rejoin the deal, however,<br />the Israeli prime minster said that he will do<br />whatever it takes for Israel to not be apart of<br />the agreement, which could play an effect on the<br />US's decision to join.","Nicholas Chao (40%): It's pretty even right now<br />and anything could happen before November 8th.<br />But, the Democrats will most likely keep their<br />majority in the senate. With Biden's approval<br />ratings also rising slowly, this will also aid the<br />party.","Nicholas Chao (100%): Her popularity and high<br />follower count gives her a slight edge on the<br />other contestants on reality TV. She also has had<br />the highest scores on her debut performance.","Nicholas Chao (100%): The trend spiked around<br />mid-to-early 2021 and does not seem to come down<br />anytime soon. Even if it does, I do not believe it<br />will before next month.","Nicholas Chao (70%): I believe that Marvel has<br />seen that their recent movies have not done so<br />well from all the jokingness and veering from the<br />main plot. They will step in a different direction<br />with this new Black Panther. The first Black<br />Panther also has the highest rotten tomatoes of<br />all Marvel movies, so they will try to preserve<br />their greatness and they will also have to honor<br />Chadwick.","Nicholas Chao (0%): With lots of controversy<br />revolving around this decision and people<br />questioning Biden's leadership, I believe he<br />would not do something so major. Midterms are<br />also coming up and this could seriously affect the<br />democratic party.","Olivia West (20%): Considering after the<br />Democratic Party took over the White House<br />in the 2020 election, I think there is a slim<br />to no chance that the Republican Party will<br />win a majority of seats in the US House of<br />Representatives on November 8. Additionally, the<br />Democrats kept control of the U.S. House after<br />gaining 222 seats to the Republicans' 213 in<br />2020. Democrats currently hold a 221-212 edge in<br />the U.S. House, which has two vacancies, as of<br />September 20, 2022, making the chances even lower<br />that the republicans will win .","Olivia West (60%): I think that Charli D'Amelio<br />and her dance partner have a fairly high chance<br />of winning dancing with the stars considering<br />Charli's amount of fame. Despite her being a great<br />dancer, she has over 100 million followers on<br />social media, giving her a strong lead way against<br />her competitors.","Olivia West (80%): The US inflation rate has<br />slightly dropped since June from 8.9% to 8.2% in<br />August. Considering that it has dropped not even<br />a whole percent within 3 months, I think there is<br />a very high chance that the US inflation rate will<br />still be above 8% in September 2022.","Olivia West (70%): Considering the first Black<br />Panther received 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, I think<br />there is a fairly high chance that the second<br />one will score above 85%. Also, there is a $200<br />million budget for this movie, averaging way<br />higher for its production than most other movies.","Olivia West (30%): I don't think there is a chance<br />that the US will re-enter the deal given how<br />inconsistent they have been, going from nearly<br />certain in March to almost zero chances in July,<br />then back in the direction of an agreement in<br />August to yet another deadlock in September.","Andrew Decker (70%): 538 shows that the<br />republicans have around a 70 percent chance. It<br />is also statistically more likely for the party no<br />in the presidency to win more seats in the house<br />during the midterms.","Andrew Decker (70%): I do not know much about<br />Charli D'Amelio or Dancing with the Stars. I<br />do know that Charli has a background in dance<br />which I'm sure is helpful in a celebrity dance<br />competition. Also, apparently her debut dance<br />received very high scores so I think she has a<br />good chance of winning.","Andrew Decker (70%): It has been above 8 percent<br />since March and I do not think much has improved<br />so I think it is likely that it stays above 8<br />percent. I also think the recent market issues may<br />indicate a higher inflation rate.","Andrew Decker (35%): The first black panther<br />did not get above 80 percent on RT. Generally,<br />sequels are not received as well so I doubt that<br />the new BP will receive higher ratings. The only<br />thing keeping my prediction up is that I think<br />people will flock to the movie as it is Chadwick<br />Boseman's final film before his passing. That<br />factor might contribute to a higher score.","Andrew Decker (50%): I think it could go either<br />way on the US rejoining the accords. Recently,<br />Iran has called on the US to come to the table<br />and discuss the deal. Some say that it is now<br />or never to seal the deal. Biden has indicated<br />that he wants to rejoin but he will have to get<br />it done very soon. Some also say that at this<br />point the deal would be practically worthless as<br />Iran already has sufficient materials to create a<br />nuclear weapon.","Noah Herndon (60%): Although democrats have a<br />majority seats in the US House of Representatives,<br />the opposing party of the party of the president<br />usually gains majority in the house. Also,<br />redistricting has caused some democrats seats to<br />be out of reach. I think it will be close, but I<br />do think Republicans will gain a majority of the<br />seats which is why I gave them a 60% chance to win<br />a majority of the seats.","Noah Herndon (75%): I did some quick research<br />on Dancing With the Stars because I have little<br />knowledge of it. Since it is a show about<br />celebrities competing in dance competitions, I<br />do think that Charlie Damilio has the upper hand<br />which is why I gave her a 75% chance to win.<br />Charlie was a professional dancer before TikTok<br />so if she is competing against people that don't<br />usually dance, I think she has a good chance of<br />winning. She also has a really big fanbase and<br />due to the decline of views and ratings of Dancing<br />With the Stars, the show could use someone with<br />a big fanbase to win in order to increase ratings<br />and views which is another reason I gave her a 75%<br />chance of winning.","Noah Herndon (30%): I don't think that the US<br />inflation rate will be greater than 8% because the<br />inflation rate has already begun to fall in July<br />and August and I think it will have continued to<br />fall in September. Gas prices have only gotten<br />cheaper this past month and since gas has a large<br />influence over inflation, I think it is safe to<br />assume that the inflation rate is less than 8%.<br />Also, the inflation rate fell by approximately<br />.24 from July to August and if it were to fall by<br />approximately that same amount in September, the<br />inflation rate would be below 8% or really close.","Noah Herndon (80%): Approximately 60% of Marvel<br />movies have an audience score above 85% on Rotten<br />Tomatoes which already bodes well for Black<br />Panther being above 85%. Another reason why I put<br />it at 80% is because this is going to be a very<br />heartfelt movie that is a love letter to Chadwick<br />Boseman. Marvel has had a couple of misses lately,<br />but I really think that they will get this one<br />right. Additionally, just based off the trailers,<br />it looks like it's going to be an amazing movie!","Noah Herndon (15%): I gave it a small probability<br />because the government works really slow, and<br />even if Biden does want to rejoin the Iran Nuclear<br />Deal, I think it would take a long time and<br />not be completed by November 30th. Also, it is<br />election season, so Biden probably doesn't want<br />to do anything controversial that would affect the<br />midterm elections. Also, Iran really doesn't want<br />the U.S. to rejoin the Nuclear Deal, and if both<br />sides aren't backing it, I don't see it happening.","Hannah Jones (50%): Republicans are focusing on<br />the economy in most of their campaigns which wins<br />many people over. Yet, democrats are focusing<br />on more human rights such as abortion which will<br />pull other people. I think this is very 50/50<br />considering both sides have vastly different<br />focuses.","Hannah Jones (95%): Charli is already a dancer.<br />Her fans will go out of their way to vote for her<br />because the millions of followers she has wants<br />her to win.","Hannah Jones (97%): The inflation rate was 8.24<br />in August. Since not much has changed since then<br />i believe that it will hover right above 8. Not<br />only that but the past few months have had similar<br />patterns.","Hannah Jones (48%): The first Black Panther had<br />a score of 79%, typically the original is always<br />the best. Therefore this movie will probably get<br />a lower score. Also, the actor who played black<br />panther, Chadwick Boseman passed away. I think<br />more fans will go because he will be honored int<br />he movie which may up the audience score.","Hannah Jones (4%): Biden wants to rejoin yes, but<br />i do not believe that will happen before the end<br />of the semester. That is super fast and would need<br />more time. Also, the agreement would only happen<br />if Iran comes back to compliance which will not<br />happen anytime soon.","Edward Cox (15%): Often, the house stays with<br />the presidency and since there is a democratic<br />president in office, it is likely it will stay.<br />Also, over the past few years, the house has had a<br />majority of democratic seats so it is likely that<br />it will not change.","Edward Cox (99%): Because she has such a large<br />fan base and she is a pretty good dancer, she will<br />probably win.","Edward Cox (85%): I think it is very likely that<br />it will because looking at the last 10 years<br />or so, the rate of inflation is about equal to<br />august every year. It does not seem to differ too<br />much. It would need to be a significant drop and<br />something major would have to happen for it not to<br />be over 8%.","Edward Cox (90%): I am pretty positive because<br />it is so highly anticipated and it is directed<br />by Ryan Coogler, it will probably do very well.<br />Almost all of Ryan Coogler’s movies he has<br />directed has made over an 85 rotten tomatoes<br />score.","Edward Cox (15%): Our former president royally<br />pissed them off. They want nothing to do with us<br />and with the Ukraine war going on, this is not our<br />most pressing issue at the moment."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.66929133858268,"symbol":"circle","line":{"width":1.88976377952756,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.4,5.6],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.88976377952756,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.2283105022831,"r":7.30593607305936,"b":40.1826484018265,"l":157.077625570776},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.05,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.65296803652968,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.4,5.6],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Charli DAmelio and<br />her dance partner win<br />Dancing With the Stars in<br />November?","Will the new Black<br />Panther movie get an<br />audience score above 85%<br />on Rotten Tomatoes?","Will the Republican<br />Party win a majority of<br />seats in the US House<br />of Representatives on<br />November 8?","Will the US inflation<br />rate be greater than 8%<br />in September 2022?","Will US rejoin the Iran<br />Nuclear Deal by the end<br />of the semester (November<br />30)?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3,4,5],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Charli DAmelio and<br />her dance partner win<br />Dancing With the Stars in<br />November?","Will the new Black<br />Panther movie get an<br />audience score above 85%<br />on Rotten Tomatoes?","Will the Republican<br />Party win a majority of<br />seats in the US House<br />of Representatives on<br />November 8?","Will the US inflation<br />rate be greater than 8%<br />in September 2022?","Will US rejoin the Iran<br />Nuclear Deal by the end<br />of the semester (November<br />30)?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.65296803652968,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"384c6ecdf51":{"x":{},"y":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"384c12861612":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"384c6ecdf51","visdat":{"384c6ecdf51":["function (y) ","x"],"384c12861612":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.2,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
