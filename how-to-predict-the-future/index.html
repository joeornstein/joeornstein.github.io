Right now on<br />FanDuel you can pay $100 for the chance to win<br />$210 if the Chiefs win the Superbowl.

That said, with 53 Republican<br />seats in the Senate, four Republicans would need<br />to join every single Democrat in order to sink<br />a nomination, and there are very few current<br />nominees where this seems plausible (Gabbard,<br />Kennedy, and Patel are likely to generate the most<br />controversy, but it would be surprising at this<br />point if four or more Republicans voted against<br />them). Of course, the cabinet-level picks are<br />just the tip of the iceberg: there are nearly<br />1300 presidential nominations that require Senate<br />confirmation. Most of these tend not to generate<br />controversy (e.g. military commissions), but there<br />are so many of them that the chances they are all<br />confirmed starts to get small.","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,255,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,255,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,1)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.69999999999999996,0.40000000000000002,0.34999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.28470000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.87,0.45000000000000001,0.55000000000000004,1,0.31,0.55000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.37,0.35999999999999999,0.69999999999999996,0.80000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.39000000000000001,0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.66000000000000003,0.25,0.29999999999999999,0.32000000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.34999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.51000000000000001,0.89000000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.37,0.59999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.75,0.45000000000000001,0.34999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.55000000000000004,0.69999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.41999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.31,0.40000000000000002,0.10000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.46999999999999997,0.90000000000000002,0.34999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.34999999999999998,0.41999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.59999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.55000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.29999999999999999,0.34999999999999998,0.45000000000000001,0.25],"y":[2.0377849627984688,2.0342001572949813,2.0442917712964119,1.9544438387732952,1.9716093533905223,2.0288180633215234,2.0052898221882058,2.0480954366503283,1.9821069091791288,2.0306543803075328,1.973600235581398,2.0174608142813666,2.0200146641815082,1.9891500390367582,2.0191374898888172,2.0020670774159952,1.9800145150627941,1.9537532344460486,2.0272029158892111,2.0281439539510755,2.0413704506587238,1.9676993096480146,2.0135961941676213,2.0418821295956149,2.0245969029841944,1.993759468756616,2.0032322731567547,1.9733897915575653,2.0391934029990808,2.0426270337309687,1.992820580350235,1.9598192350706085,1.9512412104057149,2.049019777891226,1.957020594761707,1.9769985062535853,1.9793659352231772,1.9812155182240532,1.9563963396474719,1.9925697307102381,1.9953938343795017,1.9674311647657305,2.0250135411275552,1.9744791038800031,1.9987940972438083,1.960547021520324,1.9618568242061882,1.992576951207593,2.0365418327273801,1.9552763988031074,2.0228527834406123,1.9557811717269942,1.9965133710997178,1.9517170871142298,2.0370462213875724,1.9814932835754007,1.9996963260695337,1.9536014063283802,2.0401593172689898,1.9941222313093021,1.9984172123251482,1.9907841075677424,1.9641761037288235,2.0305747697362677,1.9671652744524182,2.0032019909005614],"text":["Aaliyah Diaz (70%): I believe that the Kansas<br />City Chiefs have a strong chance and probability<br />of winning the Super Bowl this year. They are<br />currently one of the top teams in the nation<br />and won last year's game. While I am not too<br />familiar with football, they have a reputation for<br />playing well over the past year and have a great<br />quarterback.","Addisen Kameron (40%): I think there’s a 40%<br />chance the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. Although<br />their game with the Bills is said to be close this<br />weekend I seriously doubt they’ll lose; the Bills<br />have never beat a Mahomes Chiefs in the postseason<br />and they have a few team injuries. However, no<br />team has ever had a threepeat and I think this is<br />the Eagles’ year to win the Super Bowl. They have<br />a tight offense with Saquon Barkley and I think<br />the only thing that could hold them back is if<br />Jalen Hurts doesn't fully recover by game day.","Andreas Papandreou (35%): The Chiefs hardest<br />opponents will be the Bills in the AFC<br />Championship game. The Bills have a much better<br />offense and a defense that played exceptionally<br />well against the Ravens. Josh Allen has also<br />cleared up his interception problem that has<br />haunted him over the past few seasons. Even if the<br />Chiefs beat the Bill, they will then have to play<br />against the Eagles or the Commanders, both of whom<br />are worse than the Chiefs but have players who can<br />change the outcome of a game in Saquon Barkley and<br />Jayden Daniels.","Andy Wyatt (30%): The Chiefs are averaging about<br />+220 odds in betting markets, translating to a<br />31% chance of winning the Super Bowl. The Athletic<br />forecast, based on 100,000 simulations of the<br />conference championships and the Super Bowl,<br />assigns a 30% probability that the Chiefs take<br />home the trophy. Based upon alignment across the<br />market and projections, a 30% chance of victory<br />for the Chiefs is a reasonable prediction.","Angela Jacobs (28.47%): The Chiefs’ path to<br />winning the Super Bowl involves beating the Bills<br />in the AFC Championship and then beating either<br />the Eagles or the Commanders in the Super Bowl.<br />Chiefs have a 55.6% chance of beating the Bills<br />(from current stats). Eagles have a 75% chance of<br />beating the Commanders to reach the Super Bowl,<br />leaving the Commanders with 25%. Chiefs’ chances<br />of beating each Super Bowl opponent are 45%<br />against the Eagles and 70% against the Commanders.<br />For each possible outcome (ex:, Chiefs beat Bills<br />→ Chiefs face Eagles → Chiefs win), I multiplied<br />the probabilities of each event in the sequence. I<br />then added the probabilities of all branches where<br />the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. Chiefs beat Bills<br />→ Beat Eagles = 18.74% Chiefs beat Bills → Beat<br />Commanders = 9.73% Adding these probabilities:<br />18.74% + 9.73% = 28.47% chance of the Chiefs<br />winning the Super Bowl.","Anna Rachwalski (30%): The Chiefs still have to<br />beat the Bills to get there. As of the morning<br />of the 23rd, they were only a 1.5 pt favorite<br />over the Bills, meaning their win to even get to<br />the Super Bowl isn't confirmed. If they do win<br />and play the Eagles, they currently are slight<br />underdogs in that match up. I think they have a<br />chance, but not over 50%, and betting markets are<br />currently saying roughly 28%–30% to me seems good<br />with the \"Chiefs are rigged to win\" rhetoric.","Archita Gaur (87%): One has to keep in mind that<br />there has never been a time in the NFL where a<br />team has one three consecutive super bowls and<br />this would be the first time if the Kansas Chiefs<br />win. I analyzed fox news for some information.<br />The Chiefs have the second best odds in the NFL to<br />win, at + 220. They predicted that the Chiefs had<br />a 31.2% chance of winning. I also found another<br />website that used AI to make a prediction. AI<br />predicts that the Eagles will win 28-27. There<br />are many that give Eagles a 52% chance of winning<br />and higher odds. However, many football \"pundits\"<br />argue that the Chiefs will win based not he<br />regular season.","Ava Herring (45%): I believe that the Chiefs have<br />a solid chance to win the Super Bowl. However,<br />they are up against strong competition. If they<br />play against the Eagles, then they will have<br />to play a very good game in order to win the<br />Super Bowl, but based on their past wins, they<br />definitely have a chance to take it home.","Ayaan Fazal (55%): While I hate to admit it, I<br />have a strong feeling that the Chiefs will end<br />up winning. This is primarily because the AFC<br />conference is typically the winner in most recent<br />years and that the Chiefs have already won the<br />previous two. To put it in another way, if the<br />Chiefs win this weekend, this current probability<br />will skyrocket. Their potential opponents, if they<br />make it to the Bowl, will be either a rookie led<br />Commanders or the Eagles, a team he has already<br />beaten in the Super Bowl.","Bailey Mattox (100%): Travis Kelce has Taylor<br />Swift's luck on his side and they have the best<br />win-loss ratio compared to the other teams.","Benjamin Jacobstein (31%): According to the latest<br />odds, per Fox Sports, the Philadelphia Eagles are<br />favored to win the Super Bowl at +180, followed by<br />the Chiefs at +220, and the Bills at +260. Using<br />implied probability to convert the betting odds to<br />the likelihood of this outcome occurring, we get<br />31.25%, rounding to 31%.","Bennie Trujillano (55%): I'm ninety-five percent<br />certain that the super bowl game will be between<br />the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles<br />again. Assuming this is true, I'd say the odds<br />on that game are 50/50. However, if I'm forced<br />to make a prediction, I'd say the Kansas City<br />Chiefs will win as they have had more playoff<br />appearances, more super bowl wins, and more<br />consistent player/team statistics in recent years<br />than the Philadelphia Eagles.","Brooke Cheney (30%): The probability of the<br />Chiefs winning the Super Bowl depends on who they<br />play. They will either play the Commanders or the<br />Eagles. Based on the Las Vegas line, the Eagles<br />are favored by a good amount. When the Eagles and<br />Chiefs stats are compared, the Eagles have more<br />sacks, more recovered fumbles, and more fumbles<br />forced. These stats are especially important in a<br />high stakes game as mistakes are likely. However,<br />I am still not extremely sure because the Chiefs<br />have experience in these times of matchups, and<br />they have a veteran coach.","Chinelo Ireh (37%): The Kansas City Chiefs<br />have won the past 2 Super Bowl because it is a<br />formidable team. But, I do not think they will win<br />the Super Bowl because it will not win its game<br />against the Buffalo Bills this upcoming weekend.<br />The Bills are projected to win this weekend, which<br />will prevent the Chiefs from advancing further.<br />There is still a chance that the Chiefs could<br />advance to the next round but I do not think it<br />will win because there has been no 3-peats in<br />Super Bowl history. Now will not be the time to<br />start that.","Chloe Cooper (36%): While the Chiefs hold the best<br />record in the NFL at 15-2 and have found ways to<br />win almost all of their games this season, I think<br />they will likely fall short of claiming the Super<br />Bowl title. Even though they are favored in their<br />upcoming game against the Bills, I think the high<br />powered offense of Buffalo led by MVP candidate<br />Josh Allen will ultimately pull through. The Bills<br />also handed Kansas City their first and only loss<br />this season while Patrick Mahomes was starting.<br />Overall the Chiefs have looked unimpressive all<br />year and even if they beat the Bills, I think the<br />Eagles have a very good shot at winning it all,<br />as they are the current favorites according to FOX<br />sports.","Christian Barr (70%): Other top teams such as the<br />Lions and ravens have been knocked out, I don’t<br />see what’s stopping the chiefs for taking it all<br />the way. Betting odds for the chiefs are at +220<br />which is the most favorable so far.","Da In Song (80%): The Chiefs have been on a<br />winning streak and there's a 31.2% chance of their<br />victory, but injuries and other weather, sickness,<br />and physical conditions are near impossible to<br />predict.","Diane Johnson (35%): A three-peat has never<br />been done in SuperBowl history and from personal<br />experience (being a Georgia fan) I think there is<br />too much pressure (especially for Patrick Mahomes)<br />on this game for the Chiefs to win it. The Chiefs<br />only won their last two SuperBowls during the last<br />few moments of the game and only by a mere few<br />points. This insane luck is less likely to play<br />out for a third year in a row. Furthermore, if the<br />Chiefs play the Eagles again, they played fairly<br />recently and might have a more accurate strategy<br />to win this year.","Eli Henderson (39%): In the regular season, the<br />Bills were the only team to beat the Chiefs before<br />week 18, in which they rested their starters<br />and lost to the Broncos by 30+. However, Patrick<br />Mahomes and Josh Allen have a long history<br />together. Josh Allen performs better head-to-head<br />in the regular season, with Mahomes dominating<br />Allen in the post-season. Furthermore, if the<br />Chiefs can overcome the Bills, they will face an<br />opponent in the Super Bowl who they would have a<br />much greater chance of winning against, whether<br />it be the Commanders or Eagles, as many pundits<br />are calling this matchup the real Super Bowl. In<br />any case, this is one of the better Bills teams<br />ever assembled, and they are coming hot off a<br />barn-burner in Buffalo against the Baltimore<br />Ravens, who likely have the best 1-2 punch<br />offensively in this decade (Lamar Jackson and<br />Derrick Henry). If the Bills were able to survive<br />this dynamic duo, I think they can corral Pat<br />Mahomes and the Chiefs.","Elliana Williams (75%): I think the Chiefs will<br />take their third straight super bowl title in<br />2025. The Chiefs are performing better than they<br />have in past seasons, and so it makes sense that<br />they would follow through and win again. They have<br />to beat the Bills this weekend in order to make<br />it to the Super Bowl, and I predict it will be the<br />Eagles vs the Chiefs in the final game. The Chiefs<br />have a better defense, offensive line, and running<br />ability.","Emma Allen (30%): Sources, such as ESPN, give the<br />Chiefs the second best odds (+175) out of the four<br />remaining teams left. The Philadelphia Eagles are<br />the consistent favored to win by many sources.<br />Additionally, the Chiefs will have to face the<br />Bills in the AFC championship this Sunday. The<br />Chiefs have already lost once to the Bills in week<br />11 of the regular season. By using statistical<br />evidence from projections of their odds and<br />drawing upon circumstantial elements, such as<br />their difficult path and the highly-rated rosters<br />of their opponents, I find it less likely the<br />Chiefs pull out two straight wins.","Emma Pastor (66%): Given that the Chiefs have<br />won two of the last four Super Bowls, there is a<br />higher probability than most teams that the Chiefs<br />could win again this year. For the AFC title,<br />this is the Chief's 7th year in the championship<br />game, with a record of 4-2 (both losses being in<br />overtime). The Chiefs are currently favored to win<br />against the Buffalo Bills. However, if the Chiefs<br />win against the Bills, and are faced by a strong<br />team like the Eagles in the Super Bowl, the Chiefs<br />might see some tough competition - the Chiefs only<br />have 1 win over the Eagles at the moment.","Emma Peterson (25%): I say 25% because there are<br />still NFC and AFC championship games that have<br />yet to happen, which means there are still 4 teams<br />left in the running for playing in the Superbowl.<br />I would give them a slight advantage, however they<br />are playing the Bills in the AFC championship and<br />have already lost to them once this season. Not<br />only that, but they are once again predicted to<br />lose to the team, despite having a better record<br />this year. 25% is not only based on winning the<br />Superbowl, but making it to the game in the first<br />place.","Ethan Joyce (30%): I took the odds from a popular<br />sports book and calculated the adjusted implied<br />odds of the KC Chiefs winning, which was about<br />30% or the second highest odds of any team still<br />in the competition. Since odds are influenced<br />sometimes by public sentiment and bookmaker<br />strategies, they may not perfectly align with the<br />actual probabilities. However, if the odds are<br />efficient and based on sound market data/sports<br />data, the estimate should be reasonably accurate.","Ethan Marcum (32%): This mainly is based on the<br />current betting odds among most respectable sites.<br />However, if you are looking at opponents, Josh<br />Allen is 0-3 when facing Mahomes in the playoffs.<br />The bills have been favorites to win in 2 of those<br />matchups, and one being in Buffalo. The chiefs<br />are the money line favorite and are 14-0 this<br />season when doing so. Also, they are home against<br />the Bills which helps. Also, going off of the eye<br />test, they seem to be peaking at just the right<br />time and the Bills did get a bit lucky against the<br />Ravens. The Eagles have the highest odds to win<br />the Super Bowl and will most likely face whoever<br />wins between the Bills and Chiefs, and will Riley<br />be favored. Based off of history and the eye test,<br />I think the Chiefs should have around a 65% chance<br />of winning this game, and then again a 50% in the<br />Super Bowl. Something that cannot be calculated<br />is being clutch and having grit, something this<br />Chiefs team always seems to have. They also have<br />won 5 straight AFC championships and 3 of the<br />last 5 super bowls. Not to mention that they are<br />back-to-back champs. I would give them the second<br />highest odds to win the Super Bowl, right behind<br />the Eagles, who on paper seem to have the best<br />overall team.","Grace Mccann (30%): Based on the current<br />predictions from the rankings I believe the<br />Chiefs will beat the Bills but then fall to<br />the Eagles in the Super Bowl. I think this<br />due to the stellar performance of the eagles<br />especially in their running back and offensive<br />line. I also think the Chiefs 0-38 loss on<br />January 5th is quite concerning. Despite what<br />people say about them not wanting to put their<br />best people out so close to the Super Bowl I<br />still think it is a bad look to be loosing by<br />such large margins.

Additionally, the Bills have<br />already beat the Chiefs during the regular season.<br />If the Chiefs do beat the Bills and make it to<br />the Super Bowl, they will face either the Eagles<br />or the Commanders. The Commanders just upset the<br />15-2 Lions with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels<br />who is looking as strong a quarterback as any.<br />Additionally, the Eagles put up two convincing<br />wins against the Packers and the Rams. I don’t see<br />the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl for the third<br />year in a row.","Hampton Barrineau (35%): The Buffalo Bills<br />have been developing their team now for years,<br />with even their stadium being renovated as of<br />late. Their franchise is bound for glory in the<br />near future, and I question if the Chiefs can<br />shoulder the expectations of back to back Super<br />Bowls. That’s not even to mention the Washington<br />Commanders who soundly beat a very strong Lions<br />nor the Eagles who have a Super Bowl Threat most<br />seasons.","Hannah Carson (70%): I believe there is a 70%<br />chance that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the<br />Super Bowl. I think this because they have won the<br />Super Bowl the last 2 years. Additionally, Patrick<br />Mahomes is also one of the best quarterbacks in<br />NFL history. He has several Super Bowl Victories<br />and MVP awards. I didn’t put higher because there<br />is still 4 teams in the running for the Super Bowl<br />and there is always a chance they get beat, but I<br />feel like they have a good chance of victory this<br />year.","Isaac Fleischer (51%): Out of the four teams<br />remaining. The chiefs have the best chance.<br />Patrick mahomes has had a superb second half<br />of the season. Additionally, despite frequently<br />having less yards than their opponents, the chiefs<br />find ways to win games and have experience playing<br />deep in the playoffs.","Isabella Molina (89%): The Kansas City Chiefs<br />are strong contenders for the 2025 Super Bowl<br />due to their consistent performance. Their coach,<br />Andy Reid, has led the team to five Super Bowl<br />appearances, winning two. Considering they won<br />the Super Bowl last year, their track record<br />is impressive, making them strong candidates to<br />return and win again. The Chiefs have been to five<br />Super Bowls: in 1967, 1970, and recently in 2020,<br />2021, and 2023. Their recent appearances, so close<br />together, show they are on a roll. From the 2000s<br />Super Bowls, they won two out of three games,<br />which suggests their chances are high.","Jacob Weiss (30%): I did a probability tree<br />branching out from the AFC championship game.<br />From the AFC championship game a made another<br />branching out from each probable winner of the NFC<br />Championship Game. Further from that i Branched<br />out each team from winning the super bowl which<br />means there are 8 combinations of Superbowl<br />winning teams two are the Chiefs which is .25<br />probability of a chiefs outcome in a victory.<br />Sports betting odds have a higher chance of the<br />Chiefs beating the Bills so it is logical to shift<br />the probability of them winning upward.","Jake Garrard (37%): The Chiefs have a strong<br />chance of winning the Super Bowl, however, with<br />2 games left ahead of them, one of them being<br />to a team they've already lost to this season,<br />I cannot predict that it is likely that they<br />will end up winning. The Chiefs are only favored<br />to win their upcoming game against the Bills by<br />2 points, making their chances of winning only<br />slightly higher than 50%. The following game will<br />be against either the Commanders or the Eagles,<br />neither of which they have played yet this season.<br />In this scenario, I believe the Chiefs have just<br />above a 1 in 3 chance of winning the Super Bowl.","James Martin (60%): I think there is a 60%<br />probability the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super<br />Bowl. They have won the super bowl the past two<br />years but it's statistically very challenging<br />to win three in a row. However they have been<br />dominating this season with a 15-2 record. Their<br />upcoming game against the Buffalo Bills should be<br />a good match but the Chiefs have beaten them the<br />past four times in the playoffs so I believe they<br />will win. With the momentum and statistics the<br />Chiefs have been demonstrating for the past three<br />years, they have a pretty good chance at brining<br />home their third Super Bowl win.","Jenny Qiu (60%): The Kansas City Chiefs have<br />great experience and have won the last two Super<br />Bowls. They have been to the AFC championship 7<br />years in a row. It currently looks like the Chiefs<br />and the Lions are the best teams this season in<br />their respective conferences, so they may be going<br />against each other in the Super Bowl. Against the<br />Lions, the Chiefs have an overall record of 9-6<br />throughout football history.","Jerusalem Greenberg (75%): I know next to nothing<br />about American football, football culture, or<br />anything relating to football, but I do think that<br />in a way, the games are somewhat rigged to make as<br />much money as possible. If there is a way for the<br />NFL to make more money off of football enjoyment<br />from people who don't enjoy or care about sports<br />-- in this instance, people who like Taylor Swift<br />an obsessive amount -- they'll do whatever they<br />can to make that outcome happen. It's very likely<br />in order to draw in as many TS fans as possible<br />for profit.","Jessy Lee (45%): The Kansas City Chiefs have a<br />leading record holding the most amount of wins<br />and least amount of losses in the entirety of<br />the American Football Conference. They also have<br />the highest team winning percentage in the AFC.<br />Although they may be dominant in the AFC, teams<br />like the Vikings, Eagles, and Lions have better or<br />close team winning percentages.","Joey Khashan (35%): The Chiefs are a great team,<br />but their upcoming competition is fierce. They<br />have experienced players and an amazing coach, but<br />a difficult list of opponents. They get to play<br />their next game at home which increases their odds<br />of winning, but they have to face Josh Allen and<br />the Bills who are playing exceptionally. These<br />factors coupled with the fact that the Chiefs have<br />not been playing up to expectation make me doubt<br />their ability to win a Super Bowl.","Joshua Kang (40%): No NFL team has ever won a<br />Super Bowl three times in a row. However, key<br />players like Patrick Mahomes have remained healthy<br />through the season, as well as their strong<br />performances this season, gives them a solid<br />chance of a third straight Super Bowl win.","Julia Loggins (30%): According to current insights<br />from DraftKings, the Chiefs have a 31.2% chance of<br />winning the Super Bowl in 2025. Another statistic<br />shows the Chiefs odds to win the Super Bowl at<br />+200 aligning with the previous statistic. In<br />addition, one of their top wide recievers Mecole<br />Hardman would be absent from the Super Bowl if<br />the Chiefs were to make it. The Chiefs have also<br />won the last two Super Bowls. With that, no team<br />has ever won 3 consecutive Super Bowl titles ever.<br />The difficulty of winning 3 Super Bowls in a row,<br />Hardman’s absence, and competition from other<br />elite teams makes it extremely hard for the Chiefs<br />to win.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (55%): I believe the Kansas City<br />Chiefs are more likely to win the Super Bowl,<br />but only slightly. Ever since the Falcons lost<br />the Super Bowl in 2017, the team I have rooted<br />for has lost. I really don't like the Chiefs so<br />I feel that this year won't be any different. I<br />also know that the Eagles have the best odds right<br />now (according to NBC and various sportsbooks like<br />DraftKings and FanDuel), but in the past 5 years,<br />these estimates have been wrong 3/5 times.","Kelsey Dyar (70%): I predict there is a .7<br />chance that the chiefs will win the super bowl.<br />DraftKings set the Chiefs' odds to win at +240<br />with an implied probability of 29.41%. The Chiefs<br />currently have the best odds to win out of all<br />teams left in the playoffs. Patrick Mahomes also<br />has a playoff win percentage of .842, the best for<br />any quarterback with 10+ postseason starts. I am<br />going high because I do believe the Chiefs will<br />pull off the three-peat.","Kyle Smith (20%): In the past 5 years the Chiefs<br />have been in 4 out of the last 5 superbowls and<br />won 3 out of the past 4. They have to play the<br />Bills next and that is a really tough win. If they<br />win that game they still have to play either the<br />commanders or the Eagles and both of those teams<br />are a tough win as well. Though they are at about<br />a 30% chance by most analysts, they have a hard<br />path to the top this year.","Lawton Smith (45%): With their main last obstacle<br />standing in their way , the Chiefs have to play<br />Josh Allen and the red hot bills. No team has ever<br />three peated before in the modern era of the NFL.<br />It will be very hard to get passed Josh Allen,<br />but the Chiefs are the betting favorites to win<br />the Super Bowl as of right now. But with the play<br />style and level of play coming from Mahomes this<br />season i think it is slightly less likely than<br />likely.","Levi Thomas (40%): The Chiefs have won eleven<br />out of eighteen games this season (regular and<br />postseason) by a single possession. This high<br />amount of single-score victories points to a team<br />that looks better on paper than they do on the<br />field. Furthermore, the Chiefs had one of the<br />easier seasons this year with a regular schedule<br />that did not demand much from the team. That being<br />said, the Chiefs have won the two previous Super<br />Bowls and have an impressive 15-2 record in the<br />regular season. Though I doubt their ability to<br />win, it is not by much.","Lillie Puhrmann (42%): Football can be difficult<br />to make predictions on, but the Kansas City Chiefs<br />are contenders for winning the Super Bowl this<br />year. The reason my number is lower is because<br />of how unpredictable football can be. I find that<br />this number reflects their position as one of the<br />favorites, but also highlight their track record,<br />injuries, and strength of their competitors. While<br />they have a solid chance, you never know what can<br />happen on that day.","Mabry Cartwright (30%): Although I typically<br />favor the Chiefs in postseason matchups, I am<br />placing the probability that they win at 30%.<br />I calculated this percentage using various<br />moneyline predictions converted into percentages.<br />Also, the majority of the articles I read favor<br />the Eagles, which seems like the most likely<br />outcome. Furthermore, the Buffalo Bills will be a<br />challenging opponent, and Mahomes’ ankle injury is<br />an underlying factor.","Margaret Pope (31%): The Chiefs play at home<br />against the Bills on Jan. 26, and they are<br />currently 9-0 at home. Their defense has been<br />similar to the Bills, but the Chiefs have been<br />able to complete more offensive plays than the<br />Bills. If they beat the Bills, they will advance<br />to the Super Bowl and play either the Eagles or<br />the Commanders. The Super Bowl will be played in<br />neutral ground in New Orleans, so neither team<br />will have an advantage. According to Fox Sports,<br />the Chiefs have a 22% chance of winning the super<br />bowl, which are decently good odds. I think their<br />probability is higher because when they play well,<br />they win.","Maston Corn (40%): The Kansas City Chiefs have put<br />together an impressive season with a record of 15<br />wins and 2 losses. They secured the top spot in<br />the AFC this season and have odds of +225 to win<br />the Super Bowl, second to only the Philidelphia<br />Eagles. They beat the Eagles last year in the<br />Super Bowl by a score of 38-35. However, no team<br />has won three consecutive Super Bowls, and the<br />Chiefs are aiming to be the first team to do so.<br />They have a good chance of winning the Super Bowl.","Matthew Newby (10%): I think there is a 90% chance<br />the chiefs do not win the superbowl. I think they<br />have a low chance to win the superbowl because the<br />teams they would have to play to get there are in<br />my ppinion, better than them in the first place.","Meera Srinivasan (60%): I think it is more likely<br />than not that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the<br />Super Bowl this year. The Chiefs have won the last<br />two Super Bowls consecutively, which would make<br />this year’s game their third consecutive victory<br />(if they win). They are also playing against the<br />San Francisco 49ers, a team they faced in Super<br />Bowl LIV and beat, 31-20. I would be somewhat<br />surprised if they do not manage a win this year,<br />but I do not believe it to be out of the realm of<br />possibility.","Mia Pisani (47%): I think the Chiefs will beat the<br />Bills in the AFC Championship. The Bills narrowly<br />beat the Ravens, and this was due to a lot of<br />offensive mistakes by the Ravens. Additionally,<br />the Chiefs' prior loss to the Bills will likely<br />motivate many players on the Chiefs. However, I<br />think the Eagles will beat the Commanders in the<br />NFC Championship and the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.<br />The Commanders have been playing well recently,<br />but the Eagles' defense has historically put<br />pressure on Jayden Daniels, leading him to throw<br />interceptions. Jayden Daniels is an incredible<br />quarterback, but the rookie is likely to struggle<br />against the Eagles' defense. The Eagles lost to<br />the Chiefs in the Super Bowl in 2023, which may<br />cause a revenge sort of mentality that would<br />benefit Eagles players. The Chiefs also are not<br />the same team they were two years ago.","Niomi Nurse (90%): The Kansas City Chiefs are<br />projected to win the Super Bowl because they have<br />had a great run this season. This season they have<br />had exceptional coaching, great defensive players,<br />and Patrick Mahomes, their star player, has been<br />very consistent.","Pablo Martinez (35%): Some people might expect<br />this to be higher but that's not always the case.<br />In sports, the odds of anyone winning a national<br />title or title in their league are always under<br />the 40% range according to preseason odds. Despite<br />this, many websites like Fox Sports, Sport Pro<br />Reference, and fanduel, had the odds of the<br />Chiefs winning in the 20-30% range. I picked<br />35 not because of what other websites have said<br />but because of how the postseason has played<br />out so far in the NFL. Most of these odds are<br />determined in the pre-season where anything can<br />happen. Now that we have our playoff contenders<br />playing, we can further see what the best odds<br />are for the chief to 3-peat. I would have had<br />this number higher if the teams that were still<br />in the playoffs were different. If teams like<br />the LA Rams, the Buccaneers, the Chargers, or<br />the Steelers found ways to upset the bigger teams<br />in the playoffs, the odds would be higher as<br />the Chiefs would have had a way easier pave to<br />the Super Bowl. On average, the Chiefs have an<br />average 60.4% win rate against teams that had the<br />lowest contention for a Super Bowl. However, it<br />seems the postseason picture has been going to<br />plan as the teams seeded the highest to contend<br />for a Super Bowl are still in the postseason<br />picture despite the number 1 seed Lions's upset<br />loss over the Commanders and the Vikings losing<br />to the Rams. The chief's average win rate between<br />the Bills, chiefs, and ravens (calculated before<br />the divisional round) is around 50% a 10% drop<br />which too many doesn't seem like a lot but 50%<br />is anybody's game and who knows what can happen.<br />Taking the preseason odds into account and how the<br />playoffs have played out. I think 35% is a healthy<br />odd. I'm still new to predicting things correctly<br />but for a team that still needs to face the bills<br />and the winner of an Eagles vs Commanders. On top<br />of that the ability to 3 peat that hasn't happened<br />in the Super Bowl era, who knows what might<br />happen.","Quintin Gallardo (30%): With the current state of<br />the NFL and accusations of referee interference<br />it could be easy to claim that there is no chance<br />that the Chiefs do not win the Super Bowl this<br />season. Though they set their regular season<br />winning record, most games were won by less than<br />1 possession. This could be a tactic, but with<br />statements from members of the team, such as<br />Patrick Mahomes, claiming stern frustration with<br />the clutch wins this is unlikely. Additionally,<br />they had a decisive loss earlier in the season to<br />the Bills, their AFC Championship opponent and the<br />best team remaining.","Thomas Smith (35%): I will preface this by saying<br />I know little to nothing about the NFL. But<br />looking at previous statistics, I find it very<br />unlikely for the chiefs to win 3 back to back<br />titles. It seems no team has ever won 3 back to<br />back superbowls.","Rebecca Mcadam (42%): The Chiefs have a very<br />strong winning streak in terms of the Super Bowl.<br />Also according to sports betting and forecasting<br />sources, the Chiefs have around a 31% chance of<br />winning. That being said, they are in the playoffs<br />so the odds of them winning will only increase<br />if they stay in the playoffs, which is why I am<br />giving them more than a 31% chance of winning.","Riley Batz (30%): To make it to the Super Bowl,<br />the Chiefs must defeat the Bills this weekend, and<br />they are currently a 1.5 point favorite. Though<br />they lost to the Bills earlier in the season, I<br />believe the Chiefs have a 55% chance to win this<br />game because it is a home game and the Bills<br />are only 8-4 on the road. The Eagles are 6 point<br />favorites over their opponent in their ticket to<br />the Super Bowl, resulting in the Chiefs playing<br />the Eagles in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs have a<br />50% chance of winning this game. Based on this<br />math --> .55 * .50 = approximately 30%.","Sarah Joyce (60%): I believe it is more likely<br />than not that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the<br />Super Bowl. Out of the four teams left, the Chiefs<br />have the most wins and least losses. They have<br />also won the Super Bowl for the past two years,<br />which makes me believe that they are a strong<br />contender as they look to win for a third time in<br />a row.","Sreya Pandyaram (70%): I predict that the Kansas<br />City Chiefs are going to win the Super Bowl, this<br />is a difficult assumption since we have to get<br />through two levers. The chiefs first have to beat<br />the Bills, whom are great competitors. From the<br />post season record against the bills, the chiefs<br />won 4 out of 6 post season games, allowing them<br />at 67% chance of winning. Therefore, even though,<br />the Bills are ahead in overall games won during<br />their dual history, the Chiefs seem to be strong.<br />Assuming that this does not matter and that The<br />Chiefs have already beat the Bills their chance<br />at winning the Super Bowl is still somewhat<br />high, since they have won a previous Super Bowl<br />with the Eagles(2023), if they continue into<br />the Super Bowl, and it is also important to take<br />into account Hurt's injury. And The Commanders<br />record with the Chiefs is 14-24, and the chiefs's<br />experience may rule.","Teya Hagy (55%): I think that they have a medium<br />probability of winning, however there is still<br />a chance that a team like the Eagles will win<br />because they have a stronger defense.","Tiyanah Rowtham (30%): The Kansas City Chiefs have<br />approximately a 30% chance of winning the super<br />bowl. They are among the top contenders but there<br />are other teams, like the Washington Commanders,<br />that are said to have a better chance of winning.<br />On January 26, 2025, the Kansas City Chiefs will<br />go against the Bills at 6:30. The outcome of this<br />game will affect my prediction.","Townsend Turner (30%): There are four teams left<br />in the playoffs and so there is a roughly 25%<br />chance because of the extremely high parity in the<br />league now. However, with the Chiefs’ experience<br />on this stage and team cohesive trends that have<br />lasted all season, they have a small advantage<br />over the other three. Further, Washington has had<br />a very lackluster history and is a Cinderella team<br />by all definitions this year, so their chances are<br />more around 15-20%.","Tristan Thompson (35%): The Chiefs have had a<br />phenomenal season and past two years, however,<br />I do not believe that their Super Bowl winning<br />streak will continue into a third year. It is<br />hard enough to win two Super Bowls consecutively,<br />but winning three in a row has yet to even be<br />proven possible. The Chiefs are facing a very<br />tough schedule moving forward, and I believe that<br />each team has a chance at winning it all, making<br />it unlikely for the Chiefs to win it for a third<br />year.","Vangeli Tsiaras (45%): In my opinion, Super Bowl<br />LIX will be a close game. I predict that the<br />Chiefs will win their game against the Buffalo<br />Bills on Sunday 01/26 and will thus advance to<br />the Super Bowl. In the Super Bowl they will either<br />play the Eagles or the Commanders, where they will<br />play a tough and tight game and narrowly lose to<br />one of these teams. The most recent Chiefs-Eagles<br />game in November 2023 was won narrowly by the<br />Eagles 21-17. The Commanders have also recently<br />been strong by winning their last 7 games back to<br />back.","Wyatt Stevenson (25%): I do not think the Kansas<br />City Chiefs will win the Superbowl this year.<br />While they have had a ton of success this year<br />in the regular season and postseason, due to<br />the remaining competition, I believe either the<br />Bills or the Eagles/Commanders could pull off an<br />upset. The Chiefs have not had the same offensive<br />production as years past and due to the Bills and<br />Eagles/Commanders success, I believe one of these<br />teams can get the job done this year."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.10000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.25,1,0.20000000000000001,0.62,0.65000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.25,0.45000000000000001,0.81999999999999995,0.90000000000000002,0.28000000000000003,0.90000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.75,0.12,0.25,0.29999999999999999,0.94999999999999996,0.75,0.34999999999999998,0.75,0.10000000000000001,0.65000000000000002,0.25,0.65000000000000002,0.25,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.71999999999999997,0.65000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.34999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.68000000000000005,0.40000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.050000000000000003,0.29999999999999999,0.20999999999999999,0.16,0.75,0.25,0.20000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.01,0.070000000000000007,0.5,0.29999999999999999,0.56000000000000005,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.68000000000000005,0.45000000000000001],"y":[1.0319415537640453,1.0278643503552303,1.0085113384993747,1.0431517229648306,0.98139206739142537,1.0368047979660333,1.0177032235777006,0.99552955934777854,0.98142182976007464,1.0003703776048496,0.9922585640801117,0.97577293103095142,0.98403041674755509,1.0373505964642391,0.99368631236720828,0.96452017680276181,0.97368596170563249,1.0379151350120082,1.0132657385664061,0.97359750033356252,0.95714098722673957,1.0355304241180421,0.96855184263549743,0.96472243603784591,0.96633353612851347,1.0251490391558036,1.0192817704286425,0.99686308603268114,1.0052277235081419,0.97408770045731219,1.0314467584714293,0.9905485995812342,1.0413540318142622,1.0466883340617641,1.012804687046446,1.006737882969901,1.0370711776427926,0.9695049960399047,1.0258297614753247,0.95825723931193352,0.95140119162388148,1.0270505400141701,0.97472897127736358,0.96159272664226592,1.0462350641377269,0.9666779271094128,0.99075576588511471,1.0324791771592572,0.9625553374178708,0.95537804325576869,1.0494173016631976,0.99121113379951564,0.9594831157242879,1.0333679871866479,1.0492995830718428,1.0250951088964939,1.0444318263558672,0.9898169536842033,1.0294976754114031,1.0099769560387357,0.96875879357103256,0.99455793811939652,0.95849233486223961,1.0085871249670162,0.95946783516556022,0.96917487101163713,1.0496584471082315],"text":["Aaliyah Diaz (50%): I believe that his nominees<br />will face rejection or be withdrawn based solely<br />on the controversy surrounding them. For example,<br />Peter Hegseth. who has been nominated for<br />Secretary of Defense has pending allegations that<br />may cause complications.","Addisen Kameron (10%): I’m not incredibly<br />confident but I think there’s a 10% chance<br />that one of Trump’s nominees gets rejected or<br />withdrawn. During his last presidency he had 5<br />withdrawn but they were over the whole course<br />of his presidency, only one was during the first<br />year. While Hegseth was a major concern, his<br />trial went relatively well, and with our nation's<br />history I don't think these new allegations of<br />spousal abuse will stop his confirmation. RFK,<br />Bondi, and Patel are also iffy but Trump’s riding<br />such a high right now the Republicans will keep<br />carrying him along out of pride and fear. He’s<br />already had two withdraw, so I doubt he’ll have<br />anymore.","Andreas Papandreou (10%): Pete Hegseth for Defense<br />Secretary is the only nominee of President Trump<br />who is currently at risk for being rejected by the<br />Senate. For Mr. Hegseth his limited experience,<br />sexual assault allegation, and personal misconduct<br />might have become a road block in a 50-50<br />Senate, but not enough of the 53 Republicans in<br />the current Senate have viewed his actions and<br />experience as a problem. With only Lisa Murkowski<br />and Susan Collins outwardly expressing that they<br />will not vote for him it is overwhelmingly likely<br />that he will be confirmed.","Andy Wyatt (25%): Republican Senators are<br />coalescing around President Trump’s nominees,<br />including controversial ones like RFK and Pete<br />Hegseth. However, Tulsi Gabbard has a hard hill<br />to climb. 46% of Republican Senior Staffers on the<br />Hill think she will not be confirmed. If she does<br />not make it through confirmation, it will likely<br />be because she loses the vote in the Intelligence<br />Committee or she withdraws from consideration.<br />Unfavorable floor votes for Cabinet nominees<br />are very rare. Nevertheless, tradition is that<br />Presidents have their nominees confirmed, and<br />Trump’s weakest choice (Matt Gaetz) has already<br />withdrawn.","Angela Jacobs (100%): Over the years, the vast<br />majority of presidential nominees have been<br />confirmed by the Senate with confirmation rates<br />hovering around 85-95%. However, with today’s<br />highly polarized Congress, the confirmation rate<br />for judicial and executive branch nominees can<br />dip due to partisan opposition. Many nominees<br />still get confirmed despite opposition, so a 90%<br />confirmation rate is a reasonable estimate. To<br />calculate the probability that all 1,300 nominees<br />are confirmed, I multiplied the probability of<br />confirmation (0.9) for each nominee across all<br />1,300 nominations. I used the complement rule and<br />got P(All Confirmed)= 0.9^1300 ≈0.0000000002% or<br />99.99999998%. So the likelihood one of Trump’s<br />nominees withdraws or is rejected is 100%.","Anna Rachwalski (20%): Only one of Trump's<br />2016 nominees were rejected or withdrawn from<br />consideration in 2017, during the first year<br />of his first presidency. However, during this<br />presidency, Trump has chosen more \"risky\" picks<br />with less traditional political backgrounds and<br />expertise in the area of the department they've<br />been chosen to lead. I don't think it's likely<br />that with the Republicans 51-45 majority (more<br />like 51-47 with independents) that any nominee<br />will be rejected. With only 1 nominee withdrawn<br />in 2016, when Trump's power was less solidified, I<br />don't believe it's incredibly likely that any will<br />be this time.","Archita Gaur (62%): Only one nominee has been<br />confirmed - Marco Rubio. He received a unanimous<br />vote from the GOP Senate. Republicans control<br />the chamber 53-47. Each nominee can lose only<br />three Republicans and still get confirmed. The<br />nominee I believe that will fail is Pete Hegseth.<br />The Senate only voted 51-49 to advance, that<br />means two Republicans already have voted against<br />him. I believe he could fall and that is why my<br />probability is more than 50%. I also believe Kash<br />Patel might face challenges.","Ava Herring (65%): I believe that it is more than<br />likely that one of his elected Senate members<br />will be rejected or withdrawn because this has<br />been a common occurrence in the history of the<br />American presidency. The members that Donald Trump<br />has elected have had conflicts over interests and<br />ideological mindsets. Political tension is high<br />now, and differing opinions can cause tension.","Ayaan Fazal (95%): Yes, I beileve that President<br />Trump will have nominees that are rejected or have<br />withdrawn. Historically, this has always been the<br />case (rejection/withdrawal) for elected Presidents<br />and I strongly believe it will happen.","Bailey Mattox (90%): While it is rare for a<br />senate-confirmable nominee to be rejected I think<br />at least one will either be rejected or withdraw,<br />just because there are so many of them.","Benjamin Jacobstein (25%): The republican majority<br />in the senate, though slim, increases the chances<br />of confirmation for controversial candidates such<br />at Pete Hegseth and RFK Jr, and many democrats<br />have already been open about being bipartisan.<br />However, according to CBS News over 17,000<br />doctors have signed a petition to urge the senate<br />to reject Kennedy over his stance of vaccines,<br />and according to the Advisory Board, over 75<br />Nobel Laureates have expressed concern that his<br />appointment could be bad to public health of<br />Americans. Despite these protests, I do believe<br />that he will be appointed and unless Trump tries<br />to test Congress' loyalty again by appointing<br />a candidate as controversial as Matt Gaetz,<br />then I do not see any of the current contenders<br />withdrawing.","Bennie Trujillano (45%): Many of the nominees<br />are involved in some form of controversy and I<br />wouldn't be shocked if maybe one candidate is<br />rejected by the senate. However, considering the<br />GOP majority in the senate and every other branch,<br />I don't see Trump having that much trouble getting<br />his cabinet members into office.","Brooke Cheney (82%): In every presidency dating<br />back to George H.W. Bush’s term, at least one<br />Cabinet-level nominee has withdrawn. However,<br />since Matt Gaetz already withdrew, I had more<br />difficulty figuring out if another would withdraw.<br />Pete Hegseth appears the most controversial<br />pick because of allegations of womanizing and<br />a drinking problem. In addition, according to<br />USToday, Russell Vought only made it out of the<br />committee vote with an 8-7 split. Given the number<br />of controversial characters, I believe at least<br />one more will withdraw. Though the Republicans<br />have control of the Senate, Neera Tanden and<br />David Chipman, two of Biden’s nominees, withdrew<br />from the nomination process during a Democratic<br />trifecta in 2021.","Chinelo Ireh (90%): The probability that one<br />of President Trump's Cabinet nominations will<br />be rejected or withdrawn given the context of<br />what happened with Matt Gaetz and the general<br />controversy over some of his picks. Matt Gaetz<br />withdrew his nomination for Attorney General<br />because of his criminal charges and had to be<br />replaced by Pam Bondi. Other nominees such as<br />Linda McMahon for the Secretary of Education are<br />controversial because she has no tie to the sector<br />and has plans to make public education a matter<br />for the states.","Chloe Cooper (28%): In my briefing I go into more<br />detail, but with a 53 to 47 Republican majority<br />in the senate and a general trend of no nominees<br />being rejected since 1989, it seems highly<br />unlikely that any of President Trump's nominees<br />get rejected. This coupled with the likelihood<br />that republicans will simply vote party line makes<br />this conclusion more sound. The reason it's not<br />lower is it is still possible for allegations to<br />come out against a nominee which forces them to<br />withdraw from the race. Other than that it seems<br />very unlikely that any nominees don't make it.","Da In Song (90%): Considering the fact the house<br />is in a Republican majority, it would make sense<br />for me to be more uncertain about Trump's nominees<br />passing the final check. However, two nominees<br />have already withdrawn and Hegseth is facing<br />Republican backlash from his actions as well as<br />Democratic opposition. The likelihood Hegseth<br />gets nominated depends on feminist views of women<br />in the workforce. There are eight republican<br />women senators, and three are needed to stop his<br />confirmation. We have a 37% chance Hegseth will be<br />withdrawn, notwithstanding other nominees, such as<br />Pam Bondi.","Diane Johnson (85%): Using Matt Gaetz’s sexual<br />assault controversy as an example, several other<br />of Trump’s nominees have similar allegations<br />surrounding them; including Pete Hegseth and<br />Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As these cases develop, it<br />is almost certain that the outcome will be similar<br />to Matt Gaetz and that they will be withdrawn,<br />either by force or by choice. Furthermore, there<br />are other controversial nominees for different<br />reasons. Both Tulsi Gabbard and Doug Burgum have<br />been called controversial by democrats for their<br />extreme rightist stances on political issues such<br />as climate change and U.S intelligence.","Eli Henderson (15%): The Republicans currently<br />control the Senate by 53-47. Looking at the most<br />controversial nominee with the most precarious<br />position, Pete Hegseth, his own sister provided<br />an affidavit that claimed he has regularly<br />abused alcohol and caused his ex-wife to fear<br />for her safety around him. In any case, they<br />still supported him overwhelmingly, with only<br />two defectors in the earlier votes about him. If<br />Hegseth makes it through the Senate, it's hard<br />to imagine anyone else wouldn't be able to. Then<br />again, weird things happen in politics, especially<br />now, so I would say it's overwhelmingly unlikely<br />that any of the nominees don't make it past the<br />Senate.","Elliana Williams (25%): I chose a low probability<br />because it is very rare for a Senate confirmable<br />nominee to be rejected, especially if the Senate<br />is the same party as the President. Only 9<br />nominees for Cabinet positions have ever faced<br />rejection. Though Trump is controversial as a<br />person, I do not think it is probable that one<br />of his nominees will get rejected. However, I<br />will not say it is impossible, since not all<br />Republicans in the Senate support him.","Emma Allen (60%): As of January 21st, Republicans<br />currently hold 53 seats in the Senate. I think<br />the Republican controlled Senate will more than<br />likely confirm most of Trump’s Senate-confirmable<br />nominees considering the partisan divide has<br />only grown greater in modern times. However,<br />because there is a significant number of<br />Senate-confirmable nominee positions and the<br />process can be so extensive, I think there's a<br />likely chance at least one nominee withdraws from<br />consideration due to personal scandals similar<br />to Matt Gaezt, who some believed withdrew from<br />consideration of AG because of the destructive<br />information that would be coming out of the ethics<br />report.","Emma Pastor (20%): I predict that the chances<br />of one of President Trump’s senate-confirmable<br />nominees withdrawing or being rejected from<br />consideration are around 20%. This is considering<br />that the US Senate currently has a Republican<br />majority, the party of President Trump. Looking<br />back at strictly cabinet nominees, only 9 in the<br />nation’s nearly 250 years have historically been<br />denied confirmation, while 19 have withdrawn,<br />both relatively small numbers in comparison to<br />the number of nominees the nation has seen over<br />the years. However, considering how polarized<br />the country currently is, and the relative<br />unpopularity of some nominees, I would not say the<br />chances of this occurring are zero.","Emma Peterson (10%): My reasoning for putting<br />my probability at 10% is because having a<br />Presidential nominee rejected is rare. I did<br />keep it at 10 because Matt Gaetz did withdraw his<br />name already so there is a chance it can happen<br />again. I also believe the Senate has a Republican<br />majority right now, and they are more likely to<br />pass a Republican President's nomination than deny<br />it. There has also only been 9 rejected nominees<br />in history, and 19 withdrawn names. With that<br />knowledge in mind I believe the probability has to<br />be low.","Ethan Joyce (75%): Throughout history only<br />handfuls cabinet appointees have been rejected<br />by the Senate. Of that amount, even less have<br />been rejected by a Senate that consists primarily<br />of members from the same party as the president<br />making the nominations. In the past 35 years there<br />hasn't been a rejection of a cabinet appointee in<br />the Senate. A potential explanation for this is<br />that presidential candidates don't pick cabinet<br />appointees who are perceived to have a low chance<br />of a formal rejection. Alternatively, candidates<br />who have a high probability of receiving a formal<br />rejection likely wont expend the political capital<br />to go for a cabinet position. However, considering<br />the nature of Trump's selections and his<br />presidency, I anticipate potential withdrawals as<br />a result of scrutinous questioning during Senate<br />confirmation hearings for either Tulsi Gabbard<br />or RFK Junior. Trump has had the most candidates<br />nominated to cabinets withdraw from consideration<br />of any president who has nominated members to<br />their cabinet.","Ethan Marcum (12%): Republicans currently<br />hold the majority within the senate, which<br />makes it much harder for them to reject one of<br />his cabinet nominees. Also, 6 of the 9 total<br />cabinet rejections have come before the 20th<br />century, meaning the odds are already very low.<br />The last one was in 1989; however, the senate<br />was controlled by the Democratic Party and the<br />President at the time was of the Republican Party.<br />Trends also show that confirmation of cabinet<br />members has become more party driven as time has<br />gone on. Meaning, the odds that the republican<br />senate members will swear President Trump's<br />members in is likely. The only counter to this is<br />that many have some sort of scandal behind their<br />name, or have some sort of reason to not be sworn<br />in. I mainly think RFK Jr. has the most likely<br />odds of being rejected. There are some members who<br />have differing opinions to the Republican Party<br />and some can be seen as a threat.","Grace Mccann (25%): One of the main reasons for<br />the low probability is that the Republican Party<br />currently controls the Senate. This makes it<br />much easier to get the nominees through because<br />there are fewer democratic votes in play. One of<br />the most controversial nominees is Department of<br />Defense nominee Pete Hegseth; however, despite<br />his many controversies, many Republicans have<br />still shown firm support for him. There are only<br />three Republicans on the fence for him: Former<br />Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of<br />Kentucky, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, and Sen.<br />Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Beggin, Riley. “Who Has<br />Donald Trump Nominated for His Cabinet? The Latest<br />on the Nominees.” USA Today, January 23, 2025.<br />https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/23/trump-cabinet-nominees/77890492007/.","Grace Reichelderfer (30%): At the current state<br />of the Senate confirmation process of Trump’s<br />nominees, it appears that almost all of Trump’s<br />nominees will be confirmed. With Republicans<br />holding a 53-47 majority, 4 Republicans would<br />have to reject a nominee (with VP JD Vance as the<br />tiebreaker) to reject a nominee. Arguably the most<br />controversial remaining nominee is Pete Hegseth.<br />Today, the Senate voted to advance his nomination<br />to his final confirmation with a vote of 51-49. It<br />seems unlikely that someone will change their vote<br />with just a day before his final confirmation. It<br />will come down to the wire for Pete Hegseth.","Hampton Barrineau (95%): I predict with 95%<br />confidence that the Trump administration will<br />fail to appoint at least one senate-confirmable<br />nominee. Turnover within the Trump administration<br />was already at historical highs back in his 2016<br />administration, but once again Trump is nominating<br />highly controversial candidates with a lack of<br />skills. Many of Trump’s federal judicial nominees<br />did not pass the Senate due to lack of experience.<br />Now in 2024, we can see a similar scenario with<br />Pete Hegseth. Pete Hegseth is nominated for<br />Secretary of Defense despite only leading about a<br />thousand men during his tour of duty in the Middle<br />East and also having spent the vast majority<br />of his career as a pundit/host on Fox. On Fox,<br />Hegseth regularly made inflammatory comments on<br />the state of the military, attacking the military<br />leadership and rules of engagement on perceived<br />“wokeness”. His reactionary views not only make<br />him enemies in the military’s leadership, but<br />he has attacked many consensus positions like<br />allowing women to serve in active combat roles.<br />Additionally, Hegseth is being dragged brutally<br />through hearings as women from all over his<br />life, including his own mother and sister in-law,<br />have come forward stating that Hegseth regularly<br />abuses women and alcohol. Pete has dismissed<br />these without hesitation, but when asked about<br />his alcoholism, Pete responded stating he wasn’t<br />an alcoholic but he would stop drinking if he got<br />the cabinet position, which is frankly a common<br />sentiment expressed by alcoholics. Additionally,<br />Hegseth is comically unqualified. When asked to<br />name three countries in the ASEAN grouping, he<br />failed to name one correctly. This was on top of<br />many other questions of a similar issue. Moderate<br />Republicans have voted against Trump’s judicial<br />nominees before, notably moderates but also names<br />like Senator Kennedy of Louisiana. Given the Trump<br />administration already had to withdraw Matt Gaetz<br />for being a sex offender, I don’t think they are<br />going to have an easy time with confirmations;<br />Pete too is only one questionable nominee too.<br />Other candidates are similarly bat shit crazy.<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/senators-received-affidavit-containing-new-allegations-pete-hegseth-de-rcna188342<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna187909<br />https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges","Hannah Carson (75%): I am fairly certain at<br />least one of President Trump’s Senate confirmable<br />nominees will be rejected or withdrawn from<br />consideration. I believe it is very unlikely that<br />the Senate will reject one of Trump’s nominees.<br />This is because the Senate is majority Republican,<br />and they would likely try to push through the<br />nominees President Trump suggests. However, I<br />do believe it is very likely that one or more<br />of his nominees will withdraw themselves from<br />consideration. They normally withdraw because of<br />public, or media pressure and the media is putting<br />a lot of negative attention on these nominees.","Isaac Fleischer (35%): Due to the fact that<br />congress is controlled by the Republican Party, it<br />seems unlikely that any of Trumps appointees will<br />fail to be confirmed. The senate has not rejected<br />an appointee since 1989. However, it is certainly<br />possible that another nominee will withdraw.","Isabella Molina (75%): President Trump's<br />administration is already known for withdrawals<br />from candidates. For example, Trump has had two<br />nominees withdraw: Matt Gaetz and Chad Chronister.<br />This pattern, seen even before Trump took office,<br />is concerning but not surprising, as some of the<br />candidates face backlash from the public. Because<br />of this, I predict there will be another candidate<br />withdrawing from Trump's administration. While it<br />seems most of his remaining nominees are expected<br />to stay, some are facing controversies that could<br />hinder this, leading to more withdrawals or even<br />rejections by the Senate.","Jacob Weiss (10%): As of Today there are only 14<br />cabinet positions still available by the trump<br />team. If all is equal it is a 50 50 chance. All<br />is not equal a cabinet position hasn't been not<br />confirmed since 89 because most people do drop<br />out if they have issues. This late in the process<br />I see very little chance that anyone drops out.<br />Trump is unique so I still believe there is a 10<br />percent chance.","Jake Garrard (65%): It is rare in general for<br />a president's cabinet nominee to be rejected<br />via vote of the Senate in the past, with only<br />9 total nominees in history being rejected by<br />vote. However, since President George W. Bush,<br />at least one cabinet nominee has withdrawn from<br />consideration in every President's cabinet. With<br />this in mind, I don't believe any of the nominees<br />will be rejected by vote, but it is likely that<br />at least one of the nominees will withdraw from<br />consideration.","James Martin (25%): I estimate that a 25%<br />probability that one of President Donald Trump's<br />Senate-confirmable nominees will be rejected<br />or withdrawn. I came up with this probability<br />by overviewing the past trends of the process<br />where most nominees tend to be approved if the<br />party holds the senate. However controversies can<br />play a big role in the process and during these<br />processes in the past, people of the republican<br />party where faced with lots of controversies and<br />scrutiny leading to heavy levels of withdrawals or<br />rejection.","Jenny Qiu (65%): During Donald Trump's first<br />term, he had multiple unsuccessful nominations,<br />so the Senate might be more careful in confirming<br />his nominations. For both of his presidential<br />terms, he has nominated people who are less<br />than qualified to run government agencies.<br />Mehmet Oz, nominee for Medicare and Medicaid<br />administrator, for example, is a celebrity doctor<br />who has promoted pseudoscience on many occasions.<br />Additionally, although there are currently more<br />republican Senator, the split is not too uneven.","Jerusalem Greenberg (25%): Donald Trump's nominees<br />are all in the same party as both him and the<br />party that controls the Senate. It is highly<br />unlikely, unless for extenuating circumstances<br />like severe sexual misconduct or provable abuse<br />of power, that any of his nominees would be torn<br />down, as it would look bad on their party and the<br />unity of the US government to get in the way of<br />President Trump's nominations.","Jessy Lee (25%): I think the probability of any<br />of President Trump’s nominees to be rejected<br />is fairly low. With a 53-47 Republican majority<br />in the upcoming Senate, most of Trump's picks<br />should clear the confirmation process as long<br />as Republicans stay united. Given the increasing<br />ideological divide between the two parties, almost<br />all Republican senators will support Trump's<br />selections, while most Democrats are expected to<br />oppose them.","Joey Khashan (60%): It is very rare that a<br />Predisent’s Senate-confirmable nominee gets<br />rejected by the Senate, especially when the<br />President’s party maintains control of the<br />Senate. However, it is possible that another<br />one of Trump’s nominees will withdraw. Trump<br />had five withdrawals in his first term and could<br />potentially see another in the coming months.","Joshua Kang (30%): Patterns tend to show rejection<br />of cabinet nominees being rather rare, although<br />not unheard of. The most recent rejection would be<br />John Tower during the HW Bush administration. The<br />addition of the Senate being Republican controlled<br />would also help Trump in his chances in confirming<br />all of his appointments. As stated before, there<br />is still a chance of a rejection, with some of<br />the cabinet members facing some controversy - e.g.<br />Pete Hegseth, who is facing similar allegations to<br />John Tower.","Julia Loggins (72%): While notable nominees such<br />as Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are<br />facing scrutiny, the Republican-controlled Senate<br />of a 53-47 majority is likely to confirm most<br />if not all of Trump’s nominees. In addition, the<br />Senate rarely blocks nominations from the same<br />party. Of the nine Cabinet nominees who have<br />been rejected, only one was rejected by their own<br />party with such data showing a possibility of 11%.<br />Nonetheless, Matt Gaetz as well as Chad Chronister<br />have both withdrawn because of allegations and<br />backlash. If we are only predicting on if all of<br />President Trump’s nominees will be accepted, I<br />would say with around 72% certainty that they will<br />as a nominee being rejected by their own Senate<br />controlled party is very slim.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (65%): I believe it is<br />relatively likely that one of Trump's nominees<br />for Senate-confirmable positions will be either<br />rejected or withdrawn. RFK Jr. has been highly<br />controversial on both sides of the political<br />spectrum and therefore may face challenges with<br />his confirmation. Additionally, Pete Hegseth<br />is facing allegations of sexual assault and<br />general incompetency that may interfere with his<br />confirmation.","Kelsey Dyar (20%): Nearly all of Trump's picks<br />are controversial, but I do not think any of them<br />will withdraw from consideration; they currently<br />have unwavering support from the president-elect.<br />Pete Hegseth had a brutal confirmation hearing but<br />is still likely to be confirmed. I do not believe<br />enough republicans will be against confirmation of<br />any of the nominees.","Kyle Smith (15%): With the senate being republican<br />controlled all of trump's nominees will most<br />likely be confirmed. It is also rare for a nominee<br />to be rejected as it has only happened a limited<br />number of times. Some nominees may be withdrawn or<br />resign after a couple of years but in most cases<br />it happens after more than half a year. Though it<br />do not see it happening, there is always a slight<br />chance for it.","Lawton Smith (35%): Historically, the likelihood<br />that the Senate rejects one of Cabinet nominees is<br />very unlikely and is rare. Only nine Cabinet-level<br />nominees have been explicitly rejected in U.S.<br />history, (most recent being John G. Tower in<br />1989.) However, it's more common for nominees<br />to withdraw when facing significant opposition.<br />Every president since George H.W. Bush has had<br />at least one Cabinet-level nominee withdraw under<br />such circumstances. And since we have already<br />seen one , in Matt Gaetz, I believe his other<br />appointments pass in a Republican held congress.","Levi Thomas (20%): I have come up with this figure<br />because due to a rule change made in 2013, the<br />Senate can confirm presidential picks with a<br />simple majority vote rather than the standard 2/3<br />majority required for most other actions. Seeing<br />as the Republican Party controls the Senate with<br />a 53 person majority, they can ultimately override<br />any resistance from Democrats if they so choose.<br />The only reason I did not put zero percent odds<br />was the potential for any infighting between Trump<br />and his nominees or unexpected switches in votes<br />from Senate Republicans.","Lillie Puhrmann (68%): While it is rare for Senate<br />nominees to be rejected or withdrawn, I put a<br />higher probability as some of the candidates come<br />with controversy. Matt Gaetz has already withdrawn<br />because of his previous scandals, so the two left<br />with high controversies are Pete Hegseth and Tulsi<br />Gabbard. They both have some uncertainties due to<br />their past. I believe those two candidates are the<br />only ones that will possibly be rejected. Since<br />the upcoming Senate will be majority Republican,<br />Trump's candidates are in favor.","Mabry Cartwright (40%): I placed the probability<br />of one of Trump's nominees being rejected or<br />withdrawn closer to no because the Republican<br />party holds 53 seats in the Senate. This makes<br />the nominations of Republican Donald Trump highly<br />likely to be confirmed, even with the occasional<br />outlier from both parties. Also, it is uncommon<br />for the Senate to not confirm nominees, despite<br />the fact that there are some controversial<br />nominees. Furthermore, It is not unusual for<br />a few nominees to withdraw, but this far into<br />confirmation hearings and after Trump has already<br />been inaugurated, it feels unlikely. Controversial<br />nominees, Like Kennedy, are why I am partially on<br />the fence.","Margaret Pope (20%): The senate only needs a<br />simple majority to pass a confirmation of a<br />nominee. Due to the current 53-47 Republican<br />majority in the senate, it is highly unlikely<br />any of the nominees will not be confirmed after<br />Trump's inauguration. Of the highly controversial<br />nominees, there are more Republicans serving on<br />the committees who administered their hearings. It<br />is also highly unlikely these individuals withdraw<br />from the process because they have already<br />undergone the hearing process and Trump has<br />been inaugurated. The senate has confirmed every<br />nominee since 1989; however, in Trump's first<br />term, three of his nominees withdrew.","Maston Corn (10%): The Republican Party seems<br />to be currently very united and with the 53-47<br />lead that the Republican Party has in the Senate,<br />it seems like all of Trump's nominees will be<br />confirmed without much pushback. Marco Rubio was<br />confirmed unanimously by the Senate for Secretary<br />of State, and I believe that this very telling<br />of what the future holds. However, there might be<br />some hearings that draw some scrutiny such as Pete<br />Hegseth. Overall, all of the nominees should be<br />confirmed without a hitch.","Matthew Newby (5%): The senate and house are both<br />republican controlled and since president Trump<br />is a republican it is very unlikely that any of<br />his nominations will not be accepted by his fellow<br />party members.","Meera Srinivasan (30%): Given the unique nature<br />of President Trump and his cabinet nominees, I<br />think it is more likely that at least some of<br />his nominees will not be confirmed, compared<br />to individuals nominated by other presidents.<br />However, given that a great deal of confirmations<br />happen along partisan lines, I believe it is more<br />likely that the majority-Republican Senate will<br />confirm most, if not all of President Trump’s<br />nominees. It is possible that some nominees may<br />withdraw themselves from consideration, but I<br />believe that is not likely with the remaining<br />nominees.","Mia Pisani (21%): With a Republican-controlled<br />Senate, Trump's nominees will likely pass through.<br />Although some of his picks, like Pete Hegseth,<br />are controversial due to their personal history,<br />the polarized climate of the Senate leads me to<br />believe Republican Senators will unite to approve<br />these nominees. Nominees are most likely to<br />withdraw when it is clear they will not receive<br />support from Congress, and this is not the case.<br />However, several nominees, with controversies<br />similar to those of the current nominees, withdrew<br />during Trump's first presidency.","Milan Yadav (16%): Historically, it is more common<br />for nominees to withdraw when facing significant<br />opposition or controversy than to be outright<br />rejected by the Senate. Senate confirmation<br />processes often uncover past statements, financial<br />disclosures, or personal conduct that spark<br />controversies as we have seen already with Pam<br />Bondi and Lee Zeldin..... Also, the POTUS election<br />is still very fresh in the government, so it would<br />not be unlikely for senators to factor their party<br />before voting on these nominees. However, the last<br />time a nominee was outright rejected was all the<br />way back in 1989. Recess appointments are also<br />something to factor, which basically bypasses the<br />confirmation hearings process. I say a 16% chance<br />mainly considering some nominees withdrawing<br />already (Gaetz, Chronister)","Nathaniel Long (75%): During Donald Trump's first<br />presidency, he tied with John Tyler to have the<br />most cabinet members rejected/withdrawn from<br />his original nominations, 4 out of the 28 he<br />nominated, making a 14.2% chance. In addition, the<br />controversial nature of Trump and his appointees,<br />including recent sexual assault allegations<br />against Pete Hegseth significantly increase the<br />likelihood specifically of a consentual withdrawal<br />(no nominees have been rejected since 1989) for<br />at least one cabinet nominee, likely Pete Hegseth.<br />Further information is provided in my briefing.","Niomi Nurse (25%): Most of the Senate that we have<br />now is Republican. With Trump being a Republican<br />President with a predominantly Republican<br />candidate, I feel that it is highly likely that<br />most of his cabinet will pass motions in his<br />favor. For this reason, I think it is unlikely<br />that any of his nominations will be rejected.","Quintin Gallardo (20%): Assuming Gatz doesn't<br />count. Despite the controversial figures up for<br />confirmation, my belief is that none will be<br />rejected by congress, but I believe there is a<br />slim chance that they might, in order to protect<br />their future political aspirations, withdraw<br />themselves. The reason, in regards to their<br />confirmations, being that the Senate is currently<br />led and headed by the majority Republican chamber.<br />They have seemed to, for the most part, agree<br />with most of Trump’s controversial policies and I<br />find it hard for them to part ways on something as<br />trivial as cabinet members in comparison to other<br />policies.","Thomas Smith (70%): I think it is far more likely<br />for one of the nominees to withdraw than to not<br />be confirmed. 4 withdrawals happened under Trump's<br />first term and 1 under Biden. Neither of their<br />appointees had a unsuccessful nomination process<br />the last one being John Tower who was denied<br />the position of Secretary of Defense due to \"<br />claims of drunkenness, womanizing, and ties with<br />defense contractors\" which sounds very similar to<br />Hegseth's critics.","Rebecca Mcadam (1%): I think that this is highly<br />unlikely, given that it is unusual for Senate<br />to reject a nominee. Also, the senate is a<br />Republican majority, meaning that a Republican<br />president's cabinet will be more favored. Also,<br />Trumps nominees have long since been announced,<br />so it is unlikely that they would withdraw from<br />consideration this late.","Riley Batz (7%): Since 1800, only 9<br />Senate-confirmation candidates have been rejected<br />and 17 withdrawn. The GOP currently has a 53-47<br />majority in the Senate, so Trump's nominees can<br />only lose a maximum of 3 votes if they want to<br />be confirmed- but the GOP Senators are likely to<br />back Trump's picks, especially given the partisan<br />ties in the Senate. Given there are 15 cabinet<br />positions, and Cabinet-level nominees have faced<br />an average of less than one vote in opposition<br />from senators of the president's party, I believe<br />the probability of any of the candidates being<br />rejected or withdrawn is 1/15, or 7%.","Ruby Douglas (50%): The political makeup of the<br />Senate at the time will heavily influence the<br />confirmation process. If there's a divided or<br />Democratic-majority Senate, nominees may face<br />opposition. I also think that any of his highly<br />unpopular nominees may be pressured by the public<br />to withdraw because of how much media attention<br />surrounds Trump's Senate-confirmable nominees.<br />I will say, plenty of nominees who have faced<br />scrutiny have still been confirmed.","Sarah Joyce (30%): Although Trump has chosen<br />unconventional and controversial nominees, I<br />think it is unlikely that any will be rejected<br />or withdrawn at this point in the process. Matt<br />Gaetz, one of the most controversial nominees,<br />withdrew in November, so a nominee that did not<br />feel confident in being confirmed would also<br />probably have withdrawn by now. Furthermore,<br />Republicans have a majority in the Senate, which<br />makes it more unlikely that a nominee will be<br />rejected even if their qualifications might not<br />meet traditional or ethical standards.","Sreya Pandyaram (56%): There are a few ways to<br />look at this. It is important to note that while<br />rejections are rare, withdrawals are more common,<br />and also there are specific reasons why either<br />one could occur. It could be because of opposition<br />from partisans, media influence, or personal<br />issues of the candidate that intimidate party<br />presentation.For example, individuals like Andrew<br />Puzder, Ronny Jackson, and Lani Guinier were all<br />withdrawn even though their party controlled the<br />senate. Proving that having a majority in the<br />senate like Trump currently has doesn't always<br />mean that every nomination will be successful.<br />The reasons for these individuals withdrawal<br />were either due to unethical practices or a lack<br />of qualifications and support. However, Brett<br />Kavanugh is evidence that even with controversy<br />and dissatisfaction from some party members that<br />the republican majority helped him secure his<br />seat. Also previously, Trump's nomination of<br />Matt Gatez did not work out, and he had withdrawn<br />from attorney general. ABC news reports that most<br />of Trump's cabinet picks will get approved due<br />to the republican majority and also Trump's own<br />control over the party. It is stated that the same<br />party does not cause opposition. Confirmations<br />that seem doubtful are Pete Hegseth who is facing<br />sexual assault allegations, and just today had<br />his previous sister-in-law report that he was<br />abusive to his then wife. However his ex-wife had<br />confirmed that that was not true, and with Joni<br />Erst's support there seems to be a solid chance<br />for Hegseth to secure his seat. Nominations that<br />are still not secure are controversial figures<br />like Tulsi Gabbard, RFK jr, and Linda McMahon.<br />Therefore looking at this data, while a rejection<br />might not occur there could be a withdrawal. So<br />the chanced of wither a withdrawal or rejection<br />could be 56% because it is rare but not unlikely,<br />as also seen throughout Trump's previous term.","Teya Hagy (45%): It is not historically common<br />for the senate to reject the cabinet nominees. My<br />number is still fairly high because Matt Gaetz is<br />under an investigation for sexual misconduct and<br />he could be removed. However, it is still unlikely<br />for this to happen.","Townsend Turner (40%): The odds of cabinet<br />nominees not being confirmed is generally low,<br />so the odds are usually far below 50%. However,<br />this year the confirmation battle of Pete Hegseth<br />promises to be very close as it is one of the most<br />contentious in recent history. Most importantly,<br />multiple Republicans have opposed him thus far and<br />it only takes a few. That said, it is still not<br />probable that he will not be confirmed due to the<br />partisan nature of politics now. No other nominees<br />seem to be at risk of not being confirmed.<br />Included here is also the incredibly small chance<br />that one of them does something that changes the<br />game and withdraws.","Tristan Thompson (60%): I give this a 60 percent<br />chance of happening because while it is pretty<br />uncommon for a senate to vote against a nominee,<br />this group of nominees features a variety of<br />controversial appointees, and while Republicans<br />hold a senate majority, it is still only 53-47,<br />so it is very possible for at least one nominee to<br />be voted against. I also believe that it is more<br />than likely that at least one candidate will be<br />withdrawn. With Matt Gaetz personally withdrawing<br />himself from appointment, I can see it as more of<br />a possibility than not due to the controversial<br />nature of some of the nominees. Overall, I see<br />it being much more likely that at least one<br />of Trump’s appointees will be voted against or<br />withdrawn than I do for every single one of them<br />to be voted in.","Vangeli Tsiaras (40%): Pete Hegseth is arguably<br />Trump's most controversial nominee for his<br />second cabinet. Hegseth's nomination was recently<br />advanced by the Senate (51-49) with two Republican<br />Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins voting<br />against. With Mitt Romney not serving in the<br />Senate any longer makes Senators Murkowski and<br />Collins practically the only Republican Senators<br />that would vote against Trump's nominees. Trump's<br />first nominee, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, was<br />voted and confirmed unanimously as Secretary of<br />State on January 20th. One other nominee who could<br />be a possible hurdle though, and is the primary<br />reason I put my percentage up to 40, would be<br />Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi's reported ties to Vladimir<br />Putin and Bashar Al-Assad could hinder her chances<br />to advance as Director of National Intelligence.","Wyatt Dasher (68%): Trump has been pushing for<br />the national security confirmations to get quickly<br />after the terriorist attack and these are the most<br />argued people.

A<br />much more predictive variable is whether a country<br />album has also been nominated for Album of the<br />Year: historically, country albums nominated in<br />that category almost always win Country Album<br />of the Year (the only exception I could find in<br />recent years was Taylor Swift's *Red*, 2014).

During the first Trump administration,<br />the debt ceiling was suspended 3 times, all<br />with mostly Democratic votes in the House. I'm<br />uncertain that House Republicans would be willing<br />to give whatever House Democrats demand for such<br />a deal. Another scenario that wouldn't surprise me<br />is if the Trump administration simply declares the<br />statutory debt limit unconstitutional under the<br />14th Amendment and orders the Treasury to continue<br />paying the bills.

Her latest album Cowboy Carter was<br />very successful, and she already has a multitude<br />of grammy awards. She is also currently listed<br />as the artist with the most nominations in the<br />country music field. While Beyonce’s music hasn’t<br />always been country music, her dedication to her<br />career has proven that it is highly possible she<br />will win a grammy with the support of her fans.","Addisen Kameron (60%): Sure why not, I’m going<br />to go with a 60% chance Beyonce wins a country<br />category. I literally hadn’t heard any of her<br />country album until I started researching for this<br />BUT everyone seems to think she’ll win something.<br />I mostly saw people saying she’ll win best country<br />album but to be honest I have no idea. Not a<br />Beyonce stan and I’m way too culturally out of<br />touch soooo going with a nice hesitant 60%","Andreas Papandreou (65%): With the fact that the<br />CMA's completely ignored Beyonce's country album<br />I think there is pressure on the Grammy's to<br />select Beyonce to win a country category. With<br />the critical success of her album I find it very<br />likely that she will win at least one of the<br />awards in the country music county.","Andy Wyatt (85%): Beyonce is nominated across<br />four country categories, giving her multiple<br />opportunities to win a country award. The betting<br />markets are pretty bullish on her chances for<br />best album, but are less confident for the best<br />song category. However, experienced predictors<br />are more convinced by her chances in the best solo<br />performance and best duo performance categories.<br />This bet has a difficult read on it, but because<br />of the stacked odds, I give Beyonce a relatively<br />high chance of winning at least one country award.","Angela Jacobs (69.04%): First, I researched and<br />found that Beyoncé is nominated for 4 country<br />categories, each with 4 competitors (5 total<br />nominees per category). The probability of winning<br />a single category is 1/5, so the probability<br />of losing a single category is 4/5. Since the<br />outcomes are independent, the probability of<br />losing all 4 categories is (4/5)^4 ≈ 40.96%.<br />Therefore, the probability of winning at least one<br />is 1 - 0.4096 = 59.04%. However, thinking beyond<br />math, I’d say Beyoncé has a very strong chance of<br />winning at least one country Grammy. Cowboy Carter<br />has been celebrated as a \"revolutionary\" country<br />album, and the industry loves recognizing artists<br />who successfully cross genres. While country fans<br />may lean toward traditional artists, the Recording<br />Academy often favors cultural moments over genre<br />loyalty. Given all of this, I’d estimate her<br />chances at around 69.04%.","Anna Rachwalski (90%): Nominated in EVERY country<br />category, Beyonce's only threat really seems to<br />be Shaboozey with Bar Song. Shaboozey isn't nom'd<br />in the best country category, so I really think<br />Beyonce has a almost sure shot at winning at least<br />ONE of the five categories within country that<br />she's nominated for.","Archita Gaur (75%): Beyonce is up for the album<br />of the year with \"Cowboy Carter\" as well as best<br />country album. She is also nominated for best<br />country duo with Miley Cyrus, best country song,<br />and best country solo performance. Beyonce is the<br />most decorated artist in Grammy history; however,<br />I don't think she will win album of the year.<br />I think she will win best country album or best<br />country song with \"Texas Hold 'Em\" .","Ava Herring (70%): I think that Beyonce has a<br />solid chance of winning a Grammy in the country<br />music category. She is undeniably an iconic singer<br />of our generation, and her switching it up by<br />coming out with a country album is very bold and<br />unexpected for her. The album received lots of<br />positive feedback from the media, and it included<br />many viral songs that people loved. I believe that<br />the only issue would be that people do not take<br />her as seriously as other country artists whose<br />main genre of music is country music like her<br />competitors.","Ayaan Fazal (40%): Given that Beyonce is one<br />of the most decorated Grammy Award winners<br />in history, it is very likely that she will<br />win a grammy this year. This year, she has 11<br />nominations making it even more likely. But there<br />is quite a bit of competition for her so it will<br />be difficult to tell. I think she has a decent<br />chance this year.","Bailey Mattox (98%): Beyonce is nominated in all<br />four country categories. It's extremely likely<br />that she will win at least one. Out of the albums<br />nominated for best country album, she is the only<br />one determined good enough to also be nominated<br />for album of the year. Out of the people from the<br />Recording Academy who have chosen to vote for only<br />country albums, she has gotten all four votes.","Benjamin Jacobstein (95%): The recording academy<br />eats up artists who have made significant cultural<br />impact. Beyonce has made a lot of cultural impact<br />as a female black artist who completely deviated<br />in her genre of music and decided to release<br />a country album. Considering that the grammy<br />nominations for best country album include chris<br />stapleton, kacey musgraves, lainey wilson, and<br />post-malone, who are all country artists (except<br />post-malone, who isn’t a strong contender in<br />this category), I believe Beyonce will at least<br />win this country category, additionally she is<br />nominated for 3 more country categories, so i'd<br />say there is a pretty damn good chance that she<br />will win a country category in at least one.","Bennie Trujillano (70%): Beyoncé has won multiple<br />Grammy's in previous years but never in a country<br />category. This year, however, Beyoncé is currently<br />nominated in four different country categories<br />because of her first country album, Cowboy Carter.<br />Considering the massive influence that Cowboy<br />Carter had last year, her chances of not winning<br />in at least one country category are very slim.","Brooke Cheney (90%): The person who holds the most<br />amount of Grammys is Beyonce with 32. Given her<br />track record of resonating well at the Grammys,<br />I presume she will win again. Further, she is up<br />for 5 awards in the Country category, which gives<br />her a higher likelihood of winning in comparison<br />to only being nominated for 1 or 2 categories. Her<br />country album, Cowboy Carter, has made waves in<br />the music industry over the past year, and her NFL<br />halftime show on Christmas day 2024 created even<br />more exposure to her music.","Chinelo Ireh (67%): Beyonce created Cowboy Carter<br />to prove that she, a Black woman, could produce<br />a quality country album despite prior animosity<br />towards her for doing so. Furthermore, the<br />critical and commercial success of the album is<br />not something that Recording Academy cannot deny.<br />However, the country catrgories have some stiff<br />competition. Also, I think the Recording Academy<br />is more likely to award her a genre award than<br />record, album, or song of the year.","Chloe Cooper (79%): Beyonce's latest album Cowboy<br />Carter saw amazing amounts of success upon its<br />release, leaving critics and audiences stunned<br />with her work in the country genre. While she in<br />nominated for 4 total country music categories,<br />I believe the won she has the best chance of<br />winning is Best Country Album. Her main competitor<br />is Chris Stapleton who putout his album \"Higher\"<br />that was good, but not his best work. The main<br />question is can Beyonce overcome the popularity<br />of Stapleton in his main genre and take the title<br />of best country album, and I believe that answer<br />is yes. Cowboy Carter is such a masterpiece that<br />it is also nominated for album of the year and<br />should be recognized as a better album than the<br />other country nominees. While this is her main<br />category she's looking to win it is still very<br />possible that she snags at least one of the other<br />categories as well, with 16 Carriages and Texas<br />Hold 'Em being strong solo songs.","Christian Barr (80%): Beyonce being a heavy hitter<br />in the industry plays a huge role for me. The<br />optics around her viral genre change this past<br />year scored extremely well industry, being that<br />Cowboy Carter has gotten platinum certifications<br />already. I think the success of the genre switch<br />and her star power carries her over in at least<br />one category.","Da In Song (40%): For best country album,<br />according to action network.However, considering<br />her previous win streak at 32 wins of 88<br />nominations, in a matter of 4 music award<br />categories, she now has a 1.7% chance of getting<br />another grammy. 1-56/88^4 I will still give<br />her a hopeful 40% chance because this is not a<br />categorical calculation but a calculation based<br />off of previous nominations alone","Diane Johnson (100%): “Cowboy Carter” has been one<br />of Beyoncé’s most iconic albums to date as songs<br />from the album spent several weeks on several of<br />Billboard’s charts. Her songs have been trending<br />and her iconic performances have circulated media<br />for weeks at a time. There is really low stakes<br />for her competition as well, as Beyoncé’s sheer<br />existence in this category has made other nominees<br />seem almost obsolete. She has the most nominations<br />and the most wins so there is now way that out of<br />the five country nominations she has she will not<br />win at least one of them.","Eli Henderson (70%): When looking at the social<br />factors at play and the past controversies with<br />Black artists being snubbed over White artists,<br />one might expect Beyoncé to perform poorly at<br />the Grammy Awards - don't even get me started<br />on Macklemore winning rap album of the year over<br />Drake, Kendrick, Kanye, and Jay-Z. However, when<br />looking at the composition of voters and the<br />diversity push within the Recording Academy to<br />bring fresh and diverse voters onto the scene,<br />as well as the controversy that would come from<br />one of, if not the, top albums of the year, being<br />snubbed in it's main genre, I find it highly<br />unlikely that Beyoncé doesn't walk away with at<br />least one award.","Elliana Williams (80%): There is an 80% chance<br />that Beyonce will win at least one Grammy in<br />the country music genre, of the 11 total she<br />was nominated for. She has a very high level<br />of prestige in terms of the Grammys, as she is<br />the most nominated and decorated artist of all<br />time. Therefore, the reservation that she is not<br />traditional enough for a country music award is<br />not valid. The experts on the voting committee<br />have made statements indicating that if she loses<br />it will not be because of that. Then, of the<br />four awards she is nominated for, she is a top<br />contender for all of them. Three of the four, it<br />is between her and one other person or group.","Emma Allen (77%): Beyonce's album Cowboy Carter<br />has accumulated significant recognition in the<br />country music category. Currently, this album<br />holds 11 nominations for the 2025 Grammys. That's<br />the most nominations out of any artist. Amongst<br />those 11 nominations, 4 of them are in a country<br />music category. These four nominations include<br />best country album, best country song, best<br />country solo performance, and best country pop/<br />group performance. Beyonce holds 32 grammy awards<br />to her name being the the most-awarded artist in<br />grammy history, so I find it very likely with her<br />4 country music category nominations she will pull<br />at least one winner.","Emma Pastor (75%): Beyonce is the most decorated<br />and most nominated Grammy award winner, with<br />32 wins, and 99 previous nominations. In terms<br />of the country category this year, Beyonce has<br />been nominated for multiple Grammy’s related to<br />her album Cowboy Carter and its tracks, giving<br />her a greater likelihood of winning an award for<br />this Country work. Many believe she is very well<br />positioned to win the award for one of her 11<br />nominations this year, and with 5 of them being<br />in the country category, I would not be surprised<br />to see her win at least one country award at this<br />year’s Grammys.","Emma Peterson (75%): The reason why I chose 75% is<br />because Beyoncé is not only the most grammy award<br />nominated artist, she also has the most amount<br />of wins. Knowing this and the fact that she's<br />up for 5 different country music categories, I'd<br />say there's a pretty good chance that she'll take<br />one of them home. I also know that the recording<br />academy and fans alike are very pro Beyoncé<br />when it comes to award seasons, giving her an<br />advantage. The reason why it's a 75 and not a 100<br />is because she goes up against really big names<br />in categories, such as Chris Stapleton, Lainey<br />Wilson and Kacey Musgraves. She also has never<br />been nominated in this category before, which also<br />puts her at a disadvantage. However I do believe<br />she has a high likelihood of taking at least one<br />of the category awards home.","Ethan Joyce (84%): Beyoncé’s Grammy win rate,<br />based on her total of 88 nominations and 32<br />wins, is approximately 36.36%. Using this rate, I<br />calculated the probability of her losing all four<br />nominations which was 16.7%. Then I subtracted<br />that from 1to find the probability of her winning<br />at least one of the awards she was nominated for.<br />The chance of Beyoncé winning at least one Grammy<br />in those categories is about 83.9%, which reflects<br />her strong historical performance at the Grammys.<br />While genre may influence award decisions, this<br />calculation focuses purely on her past win rate to<br />assess the likelihood of her success.","Ethan Marcum (82%): Beyonce has only not won<br />a grammy once out of the 16 times she's been<br />nominated for a grammy. She has the most grammys<br />of all time. Also, she is nominated for 11 awards,<br />putting her as the most nominated artist for this<br />years grammys. The only year she did not win a<br />grammy was when she was only nominated for 2,<br />being in 2011. She also has the vast majority of<br />the media, and fans, believing that she should<br />win one, if not more, of those nominations. Her<br />provoking country album has inspired many to<br />cheer her on. It would be quite the shock if she<br />did not win at least one. She is in every country<br />category as well. While she might not be the<br />most deserving, I believe that she has grasped<br />the people's attention. While it will be close<br />in all categories that she is in, I find it hard<br />to believe that she will not prevail in at least<br />one of the country categories that she has been<br />nominated for.","Grace Mccann (70%): I think Beyonce has a high<br />probability of winning a country music grammy<br />because she not only had a very high performing<br />album but also she is nominated in every<br />available category so even from strictly a numbers<br />perspective she has the highest possible chance.<br />Also in the fan polling I looked at most are<br />picking her to win in her respective nominations.","Grace Reichelderfer (78%): Beyoncé has won<br />32 Grammys throughout her music career. This<br />year, she is nominated for 11 more. Four of her<br />nominations this year are in the country music<br />category. This is a change from her typical pop<br />style music. Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé’s eighth<br />number one album, is the only Best Country Album<br />that is also nominated for Album of the year.<br />With 32 Grammy wins and 99 nominations, she is<br />the most-awarded and most-nominated artist in<br />Grammy history. I think it is highly probable<br />that Beyoncé will win a Grammy in a country music<br />category this year.","Hampton Barrineau (100%): After noticing I<br />misread the nominations, yes, certainly, Beyoncé<br />will win at least one category in country.<br />I am most certain on II MOST WANTED winning<br />the Duo Performance Category. That said she<br />also has a very solid shot for best Album but<br />Chris Stapleton’s Higher will be her strongest<br />competition. Besides that, A Bar Song Tipsy will<br />win song/solo of the year. Mark my words.","Hannah Carson (65%): Beyonce will most likely<br />win a Grammy this year for her album \"Cowboy<br />Caviar\" or her song \"Texas Hold 'em\". Beyonce was<br />nominated for 11 Grammys this year, which makes<br />her the most nominated person in the history<br />of the Grammy's. However, only 4 of the 11 she<br />is nominated for this year are in the country<br />music category. But, I looked at several Grammy<br />forecasting sites and more than half of them put<br />Beyonce winning at least one country music Grammy.<br />It also is a possibility they they don't choose<br />her because of the Diddy scandal and her potential<br />involvement. Overall, I would say there is a<br />good chance she wins a Grammy, but I am unsure on<br />whether it will be in a country music category","Isaac Fleischer (70%): Beyonce is nominated<br />for four Country awards and each award has five<br />nominees. Assuming that Beyonce has a 4/5 chance<br />of losing any given award, the odds that she won't<br />win any of the four awards is about 40% (0.8^4).<br />This means that there is a 60% chance that she<br />will win an award. Because we're discussing<br />Beyonce, I'm giving her odds a 10% bonus. As the<br />most awarded artist in Grammy history, I would not<br />be surprised to see her win a country award.","Isabella Molina (70%): Beyoncé is known for being<br />the most awarded Grammy artist. Cowboy Carter<br />also reached number one on the country Billboard<br />chart, with one of her songs from the album also<br />being number one. I feel like a reason she may<br />not win is that there are artists who have already<br />won Grammys in the country category, and Beyoncé<br />has never won a Grammy for a country category.<br />However, due to how well Cowboy Carter performed<br />on music platforms, I see it as likely she will<br />win an award.","Jacob Weiss (55%): Due to Beyonces massive<br />popularity I believe it is more likely than not<br />she will receive an award. With her shift in genre<br />it has caused a spotlight on her. Award shows are<br />often popularity contest so due to her popularity<br />it would make sense she would win.","Jake Garrard (73%): Beyonce is nominated for every<br />single country category at the Grammy's this year,<br />with her album, \"Cowboy Carter\" and her popular<br />song \"Texas Hold 'Em\". Her song hit number 1 on<br />the Billboard Hot 100 for 2 weeks, and her album<br />is tied for the most nominations of a single<br />album ever, with Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\".<br />It is very hard to imagine that one of her songs,<br />performances or her album does not win a Grammy in<br />at least one of these country music categories.","Jenny Qiu (70%): Beyonce is not only the most<br />nominated artist throughout the history of the<br />Grammys, she has also won the most awards. She<br />is nominated for 11 awards total for this year,<br />4 of which are under the country music category.<br />Throughout her career, whenever she is nominated<br />for at least 8 Grammys (2023, 2021, 2017, 2010),<br />she has won at least two Grammys in those given<br />years. So, there is an extremely high probability<br />she will win a Grammy. She has traditionally<br />mostly won Grammys for the R&B category but<br />winning a country music award will showcase her<br />versatility.","Jerusalem Greenberg (60%): More likely than not,<br />because of the drastic success of Cowboy Carter on<br />TikTok and the precedent set in recent years that<br />TikTok, YouTube, and other social media streams<br />have a greater and growing impact on streaming<br />data used in the calculation of music success<br />on the billboards, I believe Beyonce will win<br />at least one Grammy in a country music category.<br />Cowboy Carter did numbers on TikTok, YouTube,<br />Instagram, and Facebook for months at a time in<br />2024.","Jessy Lee (65%): Beyonce is the only artist<br />nominated across all four country genre categories<br />so her chances are pretty high even competing<br />against some of the best country artists. At the<br />2024 Grammys Jay Z spoke out about the lack of<br />recognition for Black artists at the prestigious<br />event. With Beyonce's new album dropping, she also<br />brought attention to Black country artists, the<br />genre's origins, and the ongoing debate over who<br />controls access to country music. I believe this<br />will also sway the minds of the Recording Academy,<br />putting some type of unfair sway of the outcome.","Joey Khashan (80%): Beyonce was nominated for<br />5 different awards in the Country category.<br />Considering the Grammy’s is usually a popularity<br />contest, and that she appeals to the masses more<br />than the typical country artist, I think it’s<br />highly likely that she wins an award in that<br />category. I do believe that Shaboozey will win<br />Best Country Solo Performance because his song was<br />so incredibly catchy. However, that still leaves<br />Beyonce with 4 other categories to secure.","Joshua Kang (70%): Beyonce's album \"Cowboy<br />Carter\", as well as her hit song \"Texas Hold 'em\",<br />have been immensely popular. They have smashed<br />records and been at the top of the charts this<br />year consistently. A notable fact is that Cowboy<br />Carter has received the third-most nominated<br />albums in Grammy history. It is hard to see at<br />least one (either the album, song, or both) not<br />win a Grammy.","Julia Loggins (18%): Beyonce currently leads the<br />Grammys with 11 nominations. Last year, Beyonce<br />entered into country music with her album “Cowboy<br />Carter”. Nonetheless, she is going against<br />prominent country music signers such as Chris<br />Stapleton and no Black woman has ever won a Grammy<br />for a country song. For most if not all of the<br />Country Grammy awards such as best album I believe<br />that Beyonce will not win and instead Kacey<br />Musgrave's and Chris Stapleton will achieve them.<br />Stapleton has triumphed 3 times in Best Country<br />Album and Kacey Musgrave's is projected to win the<br />others. I do not believe Beyonce will win in the<br />country music category.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (70%): I believe that the odds<br />of Beyonce winning a Grammy in a country music<br />category are relatively high. She is nominated<br />for three different categories in country music<br />and I believe she will walk away with at least<br />one. I don't know much about country music, but<br />her 32 Grammy wins is promising enough for me to<br />bet that she will win in one of these categories,<br />especially considering the cultural significance<br />this album seemed to have upon its release.<br />I believe she will be commended for taking a<br />different direction sonically than she has before.","Kelsey Dyar (75%): I chose .75 because I am very<br />confident Beyonce will win a Grammy in the country<br />category. She is nominated for the most Grammys<br />overall out of any artist; she is nominated in<br />11 categories with 4 of them being for country<br />categories. The Grammys clearly love Beyonce as<br />she is the artist who has won the most overall<br />(32). This combined with the fact that she is<br />nominated in 4 country categories makes me believe<br />she will win at least one.","Kyle Smith (35%): Beyonce was named for 11 grammy<br />nominations this year for her latest album.<br />Although this means it is a heavily respected<br />artist, bridging over into a new genre may be a<br />challenge. Out of the 99 total grammy nominations<br />she has had in the past, she has won about 32<br />percent of them. I believe she has a 20%-40%<br />chance of winning one again this year.","Lawton Smith (60%): Her album \"Cowboy Carter\"<br />has garnered significant attention, leading the<br />nominations with 11 nods, including Best Country<br />Album and Best Country Song for \"Texas Hold 'Em\".<br />Now , while not actually being country music it is<br />very hard to believe that Beyonce will not get one<br />award out of 11 nominations.","Levi Thomas (70%): Beyonce has been nominated in<br />all four country music categories for the upcoming<br />Grammys. On top of this, she is either first or<br />second place according to Gold Derby predictions.<br />The fact that she has been nominated in all<br />categories, and has such high odds of winning,<br />leads me to believe she will win in at least one<br />category.","Lillie Puhrmann (65%): While this is a challenging<br />question, Beyonce has been able to obtain 11<br />grammy awards and 5 of those were for the Country<br />category. I believe that her album \"Cowboy Carter\"<br />has a significant chance of winning a Grammy, but<br />it just will depend on what the country-specific<br />voters will want. I feel they may lean more<br />towards the traditional country singers.","Mabry Cartwright (60%): Beyonce has fairly high<br />odds of winning a Grammy in a country music<br />category mainly because she is nominated in five<br />out of ten of the country categories. However, I<br />lowered the probability of her winning because in<br />two of the categories she is going against Chris<br />Stapleton, who is highly renowned in the Country<br />music industry. Also, in some other categories she<br />is going against rising stars in the industry or<br />well-respected country artists.","Margaret Pope (78%): Beyonce is nominated in four<br />different country music categories ranging from<br />Best Country Solo Performance to Best Country<br />Album. Out of all four of the categories she<br />is nominated for, she is up against more common<br />country singers such as Chris Stapleton and Kasey<br />Musgraves. The Grammy's can be unpredictable, but<br />to be nominated in four categories, I believe it<br />is more likely than not that the country music<br />voters choose Beyonce for at least one grammy win.","Maston Corn (80%): Beyonce has the most Grammy<br />nominations out of any artist with 11 and in<br />the country categories, Beyonce has the most<br />nominations with 4 for her \"Cowboy Carter\" Album.<br />It would be very surprising if she did not win at<br />least one of the categories that she is nominated<br />for. She is also currently leading the nomination<br />for all 4 country categories including \"Best<br />Country Solo Performance\", \"Best Country Album\",<br />\"Best Country Duo/Group Performance\", and \" Best<br />Country Song\". Beyonce is also the second most<br />favored album to win album of the year behind<br />Billie Eilish's \"Hit Me Hard and Soft\" so even if<br />she doesn't win best album of the year, it would<br />be very surprising if she didn't win best country<br />album of the year.","Meera Srinivasan (90%): I believe it is extremely<br />likely that Beyoncé will win at least one Grammy<br />in any country music category. Given that she<br />is the record-holder for the most Grammy awards<br />won as well as the most nominated artist as<br />of this year, I believe that she will win in<br />multiple categories. Her nominated categories<br />include Country Album, Country Song, Country Solo<br />Performance, and Country Duo/Group Performance.<br />Her album, Cowboy Carter, was wildly successful,<br />shattering records in the genre and broadly.<br />Though I believe it very possible that she will<br />not sweep the four country music categories she<br />has been nominated in, I find it hard to believe<br />that she will not win in at least one.","Mia Pisani (81%): Beyoncé has tough competitors,<br />especially for Best Country Solo Performance and<br />Country Album of the Year. Post Malone has been<br />nominated 18 times for a Grammy, but never won.<br />Chris Stapleton has won 10 Grammys and Kacet<br />Musgraves has won 7. Stapleton and Musgraves<br />are well-known in the Country genre. Every<br />Grammy Stapleton has won has been in the Country<br />category. Only one of Musgraves’ Grammys has been<br />outside of the Country category, it being Album<br />of the Year, which Beyoncé has never won. However,<br />Cowboy Carter may be seen as a breakthrough album.<br />Beyoncé’s experimentation with a new genre may be<br />the difference maker between her and established<br />Country artists.With her chart-topping song<br />“Texas Hold ‘Em,” I feel as though Beyoncé has<br />successfully crossed over genre lines. She has 5<br />nominations in the Country category, the most of<br />any artist, so it seems likely Beyoncé will win a<br />Grammy in at least one of them. With her previous<br />success at the Grammys, her number of nominations,<br />and the experimental nature of Cowboy Carter, I’ve<br />concluded there is a .81 probability that Beyoncé<br />will win a Grammy in the Country category.","Milan Yadav (72%): \"Cowboy Carter\" is the only<br />nominee that's also up for Album of the Year,<br />which will almost certainly give Beyonce an<br />advantage. This album did a lot for country music<br />in terms of genre-crossing. In the nominations<br />round, Recording Academy members are limited<br />in the number of categories they’re allowed<br />to vote in, which incentivizes members to only<br />vote in their areas of expertise. And those<br />country voters happened to pick Beyoncé in all 4<br />categories. Genre-crossing is becoming more and<br />more popularized in music in general, so it would<br />not be a surprise if Beyonce gets at least 1 award<br />this year. Also, Beyonce has the most Grammy's<br />of any artist ever however does not have an Album<br />of the Year award as of now. However.... there<br />is no shying away from the fact that all these<br />awards like the Grammy's and Emmy's are somewhat<br />biased/pre-determined and have a specific agenda<br />to uphold. There is no public criteria or rubric<br />for how these artists get awarded as well. There<br />are tons of artists every year that receive awards<br />that the mass public would have never expected,<br />and I think this year will be no different.","Nathaniel Long (80%): Currently, Beyonce is<br />the only Grammy nominee to be featured in<br />all four country categories, significantly<br />increasing her odds of being chosen as a winner<br />(Savingcountrymusic.com). In addition, most<br />nominees this year are not dedicated country<br />music stars, rather, many are pop stars moving<br />into the country genre (Post Malone, Jelly Roll,<br />etc.), meaning that Beyonce would not have to<br />compete against someone who had deeper roots in<br />the genre. The only evidence against her winning a<br />country Grammy is her statment that her nominated<br />album, \"Cowboy Carter\", is not a country album<br />(Savingcountrymusic.com), which decreases the<br />likelyhood from certainty.","Niomi Nurse (45%): It is less than likely that<br />Beyoncé will win a Grammy award i the country<br />music category, because this is her first time<br />being nominated for the award. Country music has a<br />history of also being discriminatory towards Black<br />artists, making it difficult for them to feel<br />acknowledged in that field. Some critics would say<br />that Beyoncés latest album lacks true elements of<br />country music.","Pablo Martinez (85%): Beyonce has been nominated<br />for 4 different categories in country. The way I<br />processed my prediction was to first look at who<br />she was contending with. The Grammys is highly<br />competitive with the highest well known artists<br />competing to win awards. For country, the only<br />noticeable names I saw other than Beyonce were<br />Jelly Roll, Post Malone, and Morgan Wallen. In<br />some categories, they aren't all together so it<br />increases the chances of Beyonce winning an a<br />category where she is the only known name in that<br />category.","Quintin Gallardo (70%): Having now been nominated<br />for every category of country music, Beyoncé has<br />a fair chance of winning at least one award. With<br />songs from her new album, such as TEXAS HOLD’EM<br />being nominated for multiple. Despite this Beyoncé<br />has always claimed that she has no label on the<br />genre of music she makes. this leaves me with some<br />hesitancy that a “non-country” could technically<br />win in the country category, despite being<br />nominated for all of its awards.","Rebecca Mcadam (70%): I think Beyonce has a strong<br />chance of winning the Grammy for Best Country<br />Album. She is up 74% on Kalshi for winning that<br />award. As for other awards, I don't think she<br />will win best country song and it is up in the<br />air for the rest of her nominations. Overall, I am<br />confident she will pull out a win for Best Country<br />Album.","Riley Batz (90%): Beyoncé got more Grammy<br />nominations in country categories than anyone<br />else, and she is nominated in every country<br />category. Beyoncé is this year’s only artist<br />nominated across all four country genre<br />categories: Best Country Solo Performance (“16<br />Carriages”), Best Country Duo/Group Performance<br />(“II Most Wanted” with Miley Cyrus), Best Country<br />Song (“Texas Hold ‘Em”), and Best Country Album<br />(Cowboy Carter). According to the Gold Derby<br />predictions, she ranks either first or second<br />in all four categories. For Best Country Album<br />specifically, Cowboy Carter is the only nominee<br />that’s also up for Album of the Year, which may<br />be a significant reason why she’s predicted to win<br />this race by 79.1 percent of users.","Ruby Douglas (35%): The chances of Beyonce winning<br />a Grammy in any country music category are slim<br />because of her contenders. I also feel like we<br />see people every year get \"robbed\" in any given<br />category, so I think it might be difficult for<br />Beyonce to pull out a win in a category that is<br />technically not her own. While I am optimistic<br />that Beyonce could win a Grammy, I find it hard<br />to believe it will be in a category that is not<br />considered her own.","Sarah Joyce (33%): I think it is more unlikely<br />that Beyonce will win a Grammy in any country<br />music category, but I do believe it is highly<br />likely that she will win Grammys in other<br />categories. Because she has been nominated so much<br />this year, I think the Grammys will give her a<br />nod in another category. Additionally, the country<br />music genre (unfairly) has not been welcoming to<br />Beyonce in the past, as she faced heavy social<br />media backlash when she performed with the Chicks<br />at the CMAs in 2015.","Senait Pirani (67%): Beyonce's album, Cowboy<br />Carter, has broken numerous records and has<br />produced a greater spotlight on black country<br />artists. On Instagram, she expressed how the album<br />was over 5 years in the making and encapsulated<br />her feelings of not feeling included included by<br />the genre's community. She was also \"snubbed\" by<br />the Country Music Awards (CMAs) when she did not<br />receive any nominations, which caused an uproar.<br />I think she has a good chance of winning at least<br />one of her 5 country nominations due to public<br />opinion.","Sreya Pandyaram (72%): Gold Derby predicts that<br />Beyonce has a high chance at winning the award in<br />this category, however there is tough competition<br />due to names like Chris Stapleton and Kacey<br />Musgraves who have won the award before. Also<br />Derby reasons that because she is up for album of<br />the year that it would make sense for her to win<br />best country album as well. Grammy votes also care<br />about commercial success/impact , which the album<br />has had greatly as well.","Teya Hagy (80%): I think that Beyonce's Cowboy<br />Carter album has gotten significant recognition<br />for the 2025 grammy's. In the past, Beyonce has<br />won 32 grammys and has preformed at the Cowboys<br />Halftime show in 2024. I believe that she will<br />have a very high chance of winning a Grammy with<br />her past.","Townsend Turner (70%): She has nominations in half<br />of the Grammy country categories. Added to that<br />is the fact that she is riding high on momentum,<br />having just won last year’s top female country<br />artist of the year at the Billboard awards. The<br />odds that she doesn’t win one of those categories<br />is unlikely.","Tristan Thompson (65%): Beyonce has a very<br />powerful impact on the music industry as a<br />whole. As of this year, she has the most Grammy<br />nominations out of any artist with 99 career<br />nominations. She has also received the most total<br />Grammys with 32. On top of this, betting odds<br />have Beyonce’s country album as having the largest<br />probability of winning Album of the Year, which<br />should make it fairly easy to pick up an award<br />somewhere in the Country category.","Vangeli Tsiaras (80%): Beyonce will most likely<br />win a Grammy in a country music category because<br />of her recent successful country album and<br />because she is an emerging and new artist in this<br />music category. Beyonce already holds thirty two<br />Grammy wins for other music categories (R&B, Pop,<br />hip-hop) and is highly likely to receive one for<br />her new country genre.","Wyatt Dasher (70%): There seems to be a high<br />likelihood that she win in at least 1 of the 4<br />categories she in nominated for. Through all my<br />research the fact that she didn't win any CMA<br />awards last year help sets her up to receive<br />extra attention for the Grammys. She is also the 1<br />grammar award winner. The issue that I may have is<br />that there is much conflict if \"cowboy Carter\" is<br />a country song.","Wyatt Stevenson (55%): While Beyonce is not known<br />for her \"country\" music, she still is a very well<br />known artist. Due to her popularity, the industry<br />will find ways to advertise her music a lot.<br />Like most fan bases, Beyonce's fan base will most<br />likely support her music regardless of what genre<br />is put out. She sold 407,000 album units in her<br />first day, which made it the best selling album in<br />2024. However, due to her introduction to country<br />music, it might be a little more difficult for her<br />to win an award.

TikTok has become a prominent app<br />in the world of social media in today’s modern<br />society. TikTok quickly rose to the most used app<br />in the World, with millions of dollars and people<br />investing their time into it. Buying TikTok is<br />a great investment, and I think that American<br />companies such as Microsoft will eventually come<br />to an agreement and purchase it.","Addisen Kameron (65%): Hesitantly, I’ll say<br />there's a 65% chance this happens. People keep<br />telling me Trump’s ego is so big there’s no way<br />he lets TikTok’s blood be on his hands and I see<br />their point. TikTok has been very successful for<br />Trump and I think he likes any source of attention<br />he can get. However, I’m also concerned about<br />the whole selling TikTok thing. I don’t see the<br />Chinese government letting both ByteDance sell<br />the app and its algorithm, and give half to the<br />American government which is what Trump said he<br />wanted. No idea ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","Addisen Kameron (25%): I think there’s a 25%<br />chance they suspend or abolish the debt ceiling<br />before April 28th. I think they’ll suspend it<br />because they’ve done it 7 times since 2013, but I<br />don’t think it’ll be soon. In 2023, the government<br />ran on extraordinary measures for 6 months until<br />suspending it. Funding runs out on March 14 but<br />they currently have some bulls in the works to<br />push it a little further. Trump made a lot of<br />promises last campaign about eliminating the debt<br />but then increased it by 8 trillion. I don’t see<br />this being one of his top priorities.","Andreas Papandreou (33%): For Tik-tok to be<br />available in app stores once again, the courts and<br />legislation surrounding the current ban would need<br />to be repealed. According to Forbes, Apple and<br />Google are worried that if the ban is supported<br />by the Trump administration, each app service<br />could receive a fee of $5,000 per user or around<br />$850 billion in total. It is unlikely that the<br />Trump administration can pass new legislation or<br />override the courts by April 28.","Andreas Papandreou (5%): From the perspective of<br />the party who try to position themselves as the<br />party of fiscal responsibility, an abolition or<br />suspension of the debt ceiling is highly unlikely.<br />The optics alone would be a hard sell to their<br />constituents. Furthermore, from the articles I<br />have read on the topic it seems more likely that<br />the debt limit will be increased, with support<br />from Democrats who will get a few concessions to<br />work with the Republicans.","Andy Wyatt (60%): In a broader context, corporate<br />America is capitulating to President Trump.<br />They want to curry favor with him because of<br />his transactional approach to governance. The<br />President has a serious interest in appearing as<br />TikTok’s chief defender, so whoever can make the<br />TikTok sale land will be a champion to the White<br />House. China also has a vested stake in making<br />the sale, particularly to a Trump confidant. They<br />can lessen (or eliminate) oncoming tariff battles.<br />However, even with the interest among Oracle,<br />Microsoft, Elon Musk, and others, there are some<br />serious barriers in the way.","Andy Wyatt (15%): Congress is much more likely<br />to raise the debt ceiling than suspend or abolish<br />it. Aside from President Trump, there is a lack<br />of appetite for fully abolishing the ceiling.<br />Suspension also looks difficult. In December, 38<br />House Republicans voted against a stopgap funding<br />measure that would have suspended the ceiling<br />for two years. Fiscal hawks, particularly in the<br />House, want any increase on the debt ceiling to be<br />paired with budget cuts. Raising the debt ceiling<br />creates clarity for the hardliners, whereas<br />suspension would not set a defined limit.","Angela Jacobs (55%): Trump has signed an executive<br />order to delay the ban on Tiktok for 75 days and<br />expressed a willingness to have a solution in<br />the next 30 days. If negotiations move quickly,<br />there's a possibility that ByteDance could sell<br />TikTok to Microsoft or another U.S.-based company,<br />which could resolve the national security concerns<br />and potentially restore TikTok’s availability in<br />the U.S. before April 28. However, the complexity<br />of a deal involving all investing parties and<br />government oversight will still take time. The<br />fact that we’re seeing active discussions and<br />potential solutions suggests that a resolution<br />rather than a full ban will be made. Considering<br />the uncertainty and the tight timeline I’d say<br />there is a 55% chance it’s available to download.","Angela Jacobs (30%): Congress has acted 78 times<br />since 1960 to raise, revise, or temporarily<br />suspend the debt ceiling, but permanent abolition<br />has never happened. Temporary fixes are the norm.<br />The current divided Congress makes bipartisan<br />agreement on long-term solutions, like abolishing<br />the debt ceiling, less likely to follow through.<br />Both parties have reasons to avoid default,<br />and suspending the ceiling temporarily allows<br />them to delay debate. Also, the Treasury's<br />\"extraordinary measures\" are projected to happen<br />around June-August 2025. This reduces urgency for<br />Congressional action before April 28. I’d say thee<br />probability of the U.S. federal debt ceiling being<br />suspended or abolished before April 28, 2025, is<br />around 30%.","Anna Rachwalski (30%): TikTok does not want<br />American owners. American app stores do not want<br />the fines from allowing TikTok to operate. More<br />moderate Republicans, who at the moment, seem<br />to be running the show in the House and Senate,<br />really believe the app is a security threat.<br />I think a lot of attitudes have to change and<br />ownership moves have to take place that are<br />unlikely to be compounded here.","Anna Rachwalski (50%): Abolishing the debt ceiling<br />is unpopular with Republicans and just seems like<br />Trump threw it out there. However, the fiscal<br />responsibility bill which suspended it last time<br />just expired, so there may be another suspension,<br />which would also be politically favorable for<br />Trump as it will appear as if he's addressing the<br />economy.","Archita Gaur (85%): Yes it will be available.<br />We have already been through a temporary ban on<br />TikTok which lasted for less than 12 hours. I<br />believe banning TikTok is more of a political<br />strategy to inflame young voters who rely<br />heavily on the app and less of a reality. There<br />is currently a 75 day extension; however, it<br />is unavailable on the App Store. TikTok's fate<br />remains unclear but if an American entity buys it,<br />it might be here to stay.","Ava Herring (85%): TikTok is a very popular<br />platform, and many companies have already offered<br />to buy the company in order to keep it running.<br />Based on how the last time the app was banned,<br />there was an almost immediate effort to get it<br />back up as soon as possible. I believe that the<br />app will be back on the app store by the end of<br />the semester based on the amount of the support<br />that the platform has with not only the people of<br />America but also large corporations.","Ava Herring (65%): The government seems to always<br />find a way to raise or suspend the debt ceiling<br />before anything comes from it, even if it is<br />a last minute decision. If there were not a<br />decision, there would be a negative impact on both<br />parties, which no one wants. I believe that there<br />is a strong chance that this will happen because<br />even though both parties tend to disagree, neither<br />of them wants to cause any economic damage.","Ayaan Fazal (60%): I believe that it is highly<br />unlikely that TikTok will be unavailable before<br />April 28. With recent emerging news, Microsoft is<br />a top candidate to purchase the app. With over 170<br />million users on the app, it would be a tragedy<br />for it to be unavailable for us. There is still<br />lots of money to be made in the app and many<br />creators provide through it. If not Microsoft,<br />some large tech firm will have the means of<br />purchasing it, as it stands there is lots of<br />profit to be made and retained.","Ayaan Fazal (20%): I believe that it is highly<br />unlikely that the US Debt System will be abolished<br />or suspended. This is primarily because of 2023<br />Fiscal Responsibility Act, in which the US debt<br />limit was suspended to 2025 Jan 1. This then<br />reduces chances of suspension or abolishment for<br />the United States.","Bailey Mattox (70%): Trump has made it clear that<br />he wants to save TikTok. It would be bad optics<br />for him to save TikTok at the last minute just<br />for it to be banned during his presidency. He has<br />said TikTok is in talks with multiple companies<br />in order to work out a plan for them to stay<br />available in the US. In my opinion, he's trying to<br />force them to sell and I think it might work since<br />he's a business man and can grease the wheels for<br />that deal.","Bailey Mattox (40%): I think it will be raised,<br />but I don't think it will be suspended or<br />abolished. He has criticized Biden's choice to<br />suspend it from late 2023- Jan. 2025. To abolish<br />it, he would have to have Congressional approval<br />and Republicans in congress have already said they<br />do not support abolishing the debt ceiling.","Benjamin Jacobstein (77%): On Kalshi, the current<br />probability of TikTok returning before May 2025<br />is 79%. Therefore, I believe it is likely that<br />TikTok will be available for download on the App<br />Store by April 28. Additionally, companies such as<br />Microsoft have been in discussions to acquire the<br />app. If an American company holds at least a 50%<br />stake in TikTok by that date, there should be no<br />reason it isn’t on the App Store.","Benjamin Jacobstein (10%): In December Donald<br />Trump talked about suspending or abolishing the<br />debt ceiling, but considering that there was<br />opposition for this on both the republican and<br />democrat sides of the house of representatives,<br />I do not see the debt ceiling being suspended or<br />abolished by April 28. But sometimes congress acts<br />unpredictably or unexpectedly, so you never know.","Bennie Trujillano (90%): Although there is still<br />a chance that ByteDance won’t agree to Trump’s<br />terms, I’m still confident that TikTok will be<br />returned, as Trump clearly wants to negotiate for<br />it. I believe Trump now recognizes the app as a<br />powerful political and social tool and will do<br />everything in his power to reintroduce it, as he<br />has much to gain from its return and nothing to<br />lose.","Bennie Trujillano (55%): The abolition of the<br />debt ceiling has some support on both sides of the<br />aisle and Donald Trump has been pushing for its<br />abolition. Although abolishing the ceiling doesn't<br />seem popular amongst many of them, there is a GOP<br />majority and Trump will be able to pull votes.<br />It seems more likely that it will be abolished<br />completely rather than suspended.","Brooke Cheney (75%): According to Yahoo News,<br />President Trump had said that he has spoken<br />to several potential investors, and there is<br />significant interest. Further, the President<br />mentioned that he expects to resolve the issue<br />in the next 30 days. Given the interest, Trump's<br />determination to keep Tik Tok alive, Trump's<br />preliminary negotiations with Bytedance (Tik Tok's<br />owner), and heavy reliance on this media source, I<br />am confident that it will be available to download<br />on April 28.","Brooke Cheney (25%): The federal budget was<br />suspended from June 2023 to December 2024. Given<br />the prolonged period of suspension, I predict<br />Congress is hesitant to enact another suspension.<br />I predict that they will come up with a<br />quantifiable new budget rather than suspending it.<br />Although Trump has spoken out for the abolition<br />of the debt ceiling, it has been in place since<br />April 1917, so it is highly unlikely they will<br />change that now. However, their only options to<br />not default is to suspend or raise the budget<br />limit. Given only two options, it does not make me<br />completely sure they will not suspend.","Chinelo Ireh (65%): President Trump signed an<br />executive order that paused the TikTok ban for<br />75 days to attempt to restore the app's presence<br />in America and undo the law that banned it<br />with bipartisan support. The error message that<br />appeared on the app on Sunday, January 19 after<br />being banned that said that President Trump was<br />working with CEO Shou Chew to get the app back. An<br />NPR exclusive stated that the White House was in<br />talks of getting China to sell 50% of its value to<br />American investors in exchange for tariff relief.<br />The app is so wildly popular that it would be<br />politically advantageous for Trump to get the app<br />back in stores as soon as possible.","Chloe Cooper (30%): Despite Trumps executive<br />order to delay the Tiktok ban, it seems as though<br />the popular social media app is not going to be<br />downloadable come April 28th, at least in its<br />current form. Apple has their hands tied and is<br />not going to allow the app to be downloadable<br />without clear safety and legal protections to host<br />it. This means the company likely has to change<br />hands out of ByteDance, which seems unlikely given<br />the offers proposed so far. It is very possible<br />that Tiktok gets altered and transformed into a<br />new app, but this would still count as \"Tiktok\"<br />not being available. With the app store blocking<br />downloads now, and Trump seeming to not have<br />any real plan, it seems unliekly that TikTok is<br />available to download by the end of April.","Chloe Cooper (18%): President Trump has said many<br />times that he wishes to either raise or eliminate<br />the federal debt ceiling, but it doesn't seem as<br />though he has enough support to get this done.<br />Trump has tried to suspend the debt ceiling three<br />times before in his first term, and they were<br />shot down all three times because of the lack of<br />support from the Republican party. The Republican<br />party has used the debt ceiling as leverage<br />against Democrats in the past to negotiate larger<br />spending cuts, so it doesn't really make sense<br />for them to get rid of it. Maybe it will get<br />raised before April 28th but the likelihood of<br />such a nuclear option to abolish it seems highly<br />unlikely.","Da In Song (100%): Considering the fact that all<br />presidents since 1959 have had a 100% chance of<br />raising the national debt ceiling alone, I believe<br />there is a good chance the debt ceiling will<br />be suspended or increased (both of which can be<br />attributed under different 'kinds' of suspension)<br />by April 28th.","Diane Johnson (20%): As a U.S top priority (for<br />some reason) Trump and other higher ups will<br />try to obtain TikTok’s specific algorithm for<br />themselves. Even though ByteDance is refusing<br />to sell, the 75 day suspension just gives more<br />time for billionaires to make a power grab or<br />politicians make a legal loophole that will allow<br />the U.S to obtain TikTok and completely change its<br />algorithm and its name, much like Musk did with<br />Twitter. So, even if TikTok is unbanned, it will<br />still be a different app entirely.","Diane Johnson (40%): The last time the federal<br />debt ceiling was suspended was in June 2023 and<br />the suspension only recently ended on January<br />1st 2025 meaning the suspension lasted for over<br />a year. During this time, the U.S elected a<br />new president known for being frugal with using<br />government loans to help the American economy.<br />With a new republican senate, and with such a long<br />suspension time, it seems unlikely that the debt<br />ceiling will be suspended or abolished anytime<br />soon because no more money will be directed<br />toward any initiatives and the same money will be<br />distributed through the government.","Eli Henderson (38%): While it seems more logical<br />for a company to simply sell in order to keep<br />one of its primary markets open, ByteDance has<br />already communicated its unwillingness to sell<br />multiple times since the pause on the ban was<br />announced in late January. Furthermore, ByteDance<br />is facing an ultimatum on either selling to keep<br />the app available in the US, which logically<br />would mean that the price at which they would be<br />comfortable selling would be far lower than what<br />non-Chinese companies would be willing to buy.<br />It's possible that TikTok could be sold without<br />the Algorithm for far less capital, which is why<br />I'm not supremely confident in ByteDance holding<br />out. However, only ~%16 of users are in the US,<br />meaning selling TikTok to a non-Chinese company<br />at a discounted rate ultimately would not prove<br />profitable.","Eli Henderson (40%): It's far more likely for the<br />debt ceiling to be raised rather than abolished.<br />This is because typically, Republicans, who<br />control both houses of Congress, have voted<br />against measures that would get rid of the debt<br />ceiling. In recent years when the debt ceiling<br />was suspended, the earliest decision was made in<br />September of the first year of Trump's presidency.<br />That being said, it wouldn't be out-of-the-blue if<br />the US were to suspend the debt ceiling, but with<br />the close margins in Congress and the hesitancy<br />from Republicans to suspend the debt ceiling in<br />the past, it's more likely for the ceiling to not<br />be suspended/abolished, but rather raised.","Elliana Williams (65%): I think there is a 65%<br />chance TikTok will be available to download in<br />the App Store by April 28, 2025. I think since<br />there are a huge percentage of Americans who use<br />and love TikTok, Trump will work hard to bring<br />TikTok back to help his image. He is willing to<br />bring it back if the majority of shares sell to<br />a US entity and the owner cannot manipulate or<br />access information. Trump has said there are many<br />interested potential suitable buyers, including<br />Microsoft, and he intends to move within 30 days,<br />which makes me think the potential is above 50%<br />for TikTok to be able to download.","Emma Allen (60%): When looking at the entirety of<br />the situation, I find it more likely than not that<br />TikTok is downloadable by April 28th for two main<br />reasons. The first reason being because I believe<br />US officials would not be extending or allowing<br />delays to negotiate with the Chinese company,<br />ByteDance, if we didn’t have a strong desire to<br />keep the app available. The second reason being<br />the public and economic pressure that is present.<br />I find the government finding a solution to keep<br />the app in order to avoid backlash from users and<br />businesses that rely on the app for revenue.","Emma Allen (65%): As of today, the US federal<br />debt ceiling has been reinstated following its<br />suspension under the Fiscal Responsibility Act<br />of 2023. This act expired less than a month ago.<br />Republicans currently face a major challenge<br />finding enough spending cuts to cover the cost<br />of the Trump agenda, which involves costly<br />actions such as tax cuts, immigration reform,<br />and increased military spending. Suspending<br />the ceiling is much more flexible than simply<br />extending it. For this reason, I find it more<br />likely than not the debt ceiling is suspended for<br />an amount of time, not necessarily abolished.","Emma Pastor (30%): Based on my preliminary<br />research on the topic, I predict that there is a<br />30% chance that the application TikTok, as it is<br />currently named and with its current algorithm,<br />will be available for download in the United<br />States on April 28th. ByteDance, the owner of<br />TikTok, has made it clear that they do not intend<br />to sell the app, or its algorithm to another<br />buyer, causing me to believe that if by chance<br />it is acquired by an acceptable buyer before this<br />deadline, the algorithm will not be the same, and<br />will lose its loyal fanbase.","Emma Pastor (45%): The US Debt ceiling has been<br />suspended 7 times since 2013, with one suspension<br />occurring from 2017-2019 (during Trump’s last<br />term). However, Congress has made it clear as<br />of December that they do not plan to pass a<br />suspension anytime soon. Given this, and the fact<br />that the US recently hit its debt ceiling this<br />past Tuesday, I feel it is more likely that we see<br />the ceiling raised before April 28th, rather than<br />suspended or abolished completely.","Emma Peterson (65%): I put 65% because the<br />blocking of the ban Trump implemented is only good<br />until the beginning of April, meaning the time to<br />decide on the future of the app is now. The app<br />brings in serious revenue for the economy, creates<br />jobs for many Americans, and overall the complete<br />shut down of the app here in the US would do<br />more harm than good. I also know that Shou Chew,<br />the CEO of Tiktok attended Trump's inauguration,<br />meaning there has to have been some talk already<br />on selling at least part of the app to a US<br />company. The problem lies within the ownership<br />and not the app directly, and I believe once that<br />issue is solved and the government no longer has<br />reservations regarding security concerns, Tiktok<br />will be reinstated in the app stores. I also think<br />all of this has to be decided on before the ban<br />block goes away at the beginning of April.","Emma Peterson (40%): I said 40% because back in<br />December before he took office, Trump tried to get<br />another two year suspension on federal debt but<br />the plan failed. I think there's a chance he tries<br />to bring it up again for another vote, however if<br />it failed once I think it would fail again. I also<br />saw one of the tweets Trump made hinting at the<br />idea of this decision happening again but in June,<br />which is past the time frame we're looking at.<br />So, if it were to make it's way back to the floor<br />for a revote, I think it'll happen towards the<br />middle/end of the year.","Ethan Joyce (62.5%): TikTok has challenged<br />previous bans in courts, and legal processes often<br />delay or prevent outright bans. TikTok is a major<br />platform with significant user and advertiser<br />bases in the U.S., and a complete ban could face<br />substantial pushback from stakeholders. There<br />are ongoing negotiations for TikTok to be sold<br />to a different company or to implement measures<br />addressing national security concerns, which<br />could allow it to continue operating in a fashion<br />similar to its current form. Trump says Microsoft<br />is eyeing a TikTok bid to keep app in US, for<br />example. Also, Trump's TikTok executive order<br />expires on April 5, 2025.","Ethan Joyce (15%): I think that the probability<br />of the US federal debt ceiling being suspended<br />or abolished before April 28 is about 15%.<br />Congresspeople have used the debt as a bargaining<br />chip for revisions to the budget, and I don't see<br />most congresspeople being willing to give that<br />power up. Also, the debt limit was reinstated<br />in January 2025, at which point the Department<br />of Treasury began to run off of cash reserves<br />which have increased substantially since the<br />debt limit. Additionally the treasury will use<br />extraordinary measures to extend the “X-Date” (the<br />date by which the debt limit must be increased to<br />allow the government to pay its obligations when<br />they are incurred). According to the Economic<br />Policy Innovation Center June is the key month<br />for determining the X-Date of 2025. However,<br />they also say that \"it is possible that the debt<br />ceiling will be reached prior to June 16\". As<br />the Economic Policy Innovation Center notes, the<br />fiscal situation in June 2025 will be critical for<br />determining the actual X-Date (depending on active<br />cash reserves, expenditures, etc.). Given this,<br />Congress will likely defer any major decisions<br />on the debt ceiling until closer to that time.<br />Historically, decisions related to the debt limit<br />are often made under the pressure of impending<br />deadlines, rather than well in advance.","Ethan Marcum (33%): In all honesty, I have no<br />clue. There is discussion about it being sold;<br />however, it is not verified if the owner of TikTok<br />is even interested in a sale, and the Chinese<br />government has seemed a little iffy about sale<br />in the first place. Next, there has not been<br />a true negotiation for a sale of TikTok, and<br />while President Trump claims a sale could happen<br />within the next 30 days, I don't believe that a<br />transaction of that magnitude would occur within<br />one month. There is a possibility that miracles<br />happen, but I do not think that the odds are<br />that high on this one. I see no clear path that<br />indicates TikTok being back in the App Store by<br />the end of the semester. I feel that this bargain<br />would take longer than a few weeks.","Ethan Marcum (70%): The debt ceiling does not<br />usually not get suspended; however, in the past<br />12 years it has been very common. There has been<br />talks from President Trump of dealing with this<br />issue, and even abolishing it. This issue is<br />always coming down to the last hour, so I do feel<br />that if either were to occur then it would happen<br />by April 28th. Also, I feel that there is plenty<br />of market pressure for this to occur.","Grace Mccann (85%): I am somewhat confident<br />that TikTok will return to the app store before<br />April 28th because of how integral it is in most<br />Americans life and how ByteDance the owner of<br />TikTok will probably do whatever they can to<br />either keep making money off of US TikTok or make<br />a profit off of selling TikTok to a US entity.<br />As of now Trump has said his enforcement pause is<br />set to expire April 5th so I think that ByteDance<br />would hopefully have found a solution to restore<br />TikTok by then so we don't have another lapse in<br />availability which greatly affected many people<br />even thought it was for such a short amount<br />of time. However if ByteDance does not find a<br />solution to make TikTok fully legal I don't think<br />Apple will test their legal luck by putting it on<br />the app store due to Trump just saying he won't<br />enforce it. Mercuri, Monica. “When Will Tiktok<br />Return to App Stores? Here’s What Could Happen<br />without Updates.” Forbes, January 24, 2025.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2025/01/22/when-will-tiktok-be-back-in-app-stores-what-could-happen-without-updates/.","Grace Mccann (25%): I think the US Federal Debt<br />Ceiling will not be suspended or abolished before<br />April 28th. As CNN States \"Treasury’s cash and<br />extraordinary measures should last for at least<br />several months after the first quarter of 2025,<br />according to an early analysis by the Bipartisan<br />Policy Center.\" Currently the government has a<br />bit of cushion debt wise that could last a bit<br />into 2025. The biggest factor that would affect<br />this is amount of federal tax revenue collected<br />in the spring. There is currently an idea being<br />floated by the GOP to increase the limit by 1.5<br />trillion but this would not do much to help the<br />issue and the US would still most likely hit the<br />debt ceiling by the second half of 2025. However<br />as seen in recent history policymakers have waited<br />to the last second to make any adjustments to the<br />debt ceiling so while at some point this year they<br />are going to have to do something to address the<br />issue I don't think its going to be before April<br />28th.","Grace Reichelderfer (60%): President Trump has<br />emphasized numerous times that it is a priority<br />for him to keep TikTok available in the US.<br />However, U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld<br />a law requiring the app’s China-based owner<br />ByteDance to offload TikTok or the app would be<br />removed from U.S. app stores. On Jan. 20, Trump<br />signed an executive order delaying enforcement of<br />the law for 75 days, granting ByteDance more time<br />to sell a stake in the platform and allowing his<br />administration to determine a course of action<br />that “protects national security” and prevents<br />the “abrupt shutdown” of the app. By the end of<br />these 75 days, I predict that ByteDance and the US<br />government will have figured out a way to return<br />TikTok to the App Store.","Grace Reichelderfer (25%): President Trump has<br />expressed interest in eliminating the federal debt<br />ceiling. However, eliminating the debt ceiling is<br />an action that most Republicans do not support.<br />With Republicans having control of both the House<br />and the Senate, it seems highly unlikely that<br />abolishing the debt ceiling would happen anytime<br />soon. Even if Trump pushes for abolishing it or<br />suspending it, it is unlikely that he would be<br />able to gather enough support in Congress to pass<br />this idea through.","Hampton Barrineau (35%): Tik Tok seems to be in<br />Trump’s good graces for now but the company has<br />yet to find an American Buyer and it is unlikely<br />that they will be able to reverse their fortunes<br />in court. The list of potential buyers of Tik Tok<br />is full of the more fame obsessed billionaires<br />like Kevin O’Leary, Elon Musk, and Mr. Beast. It<br />makes the thought of an American purchase seem<br />very unserious.","Hannah Carson (65%): I believe there is a 65%<br />chance that TikTok will be available to download<br />on April 28th. There is a lot of pressure on<br />law makers to put TikTok back on the App Store.<br />They've already allowed it to be in use and I<br />think soon it will be on the App Store. President<br />Trump really wants TikTok to be reinstated and<br />I think with a Republican Senate and House there<br />is a good chance he will be able to do it. I<br />personally believe they will end up selling it to<br />an American company such as Meta. The only thing<br />I am worried about is if they change the name of<br />the TikTok to something else when they make it<br />legal in the US like Twitter did when the name was<br />changed to X. The naming issue is the only reason<br />my probability is not higher.","Hannah Carson (70%): I think the US federal debt<br />ceiling will be suspended but not abolished before<br />April 28. I believe this to be true because since<br />the 1980s Congress has suspended or raised the<br />debt ceiling over 20 times. This happens many<br />years and I think there is a good chance that it<br />will occur this year. In 2023, the United States<br />spent 6.2 trillion dollars and we have been known<br />to spend an egregious amount of money on different<br />avenues, especially Medicare and Social Security.<br />I just can't see our excessive money spending<br />stopping anytime soon so I think it is highly<br />likely the federal debt ceiling will be suspended.","Isaac Fleischer (85%): Though the ban was only<br />suspended for 75 days, I expect a permanent<br />solution to be reached before the ban goes back<br />into effect. It is clear that Trump is willing to<br />work towards preventing a ban as he has already<br />put a suspension in place. Because of this, I do<br />not believe that the ban will be reimplemented by<br />April 28","Isaac Fleischer (60%): Donald Trump has been<br />advocating for the suspension/abolition of<br />the debt ceiling for a considerable amount of<br />time. By suspending the debt ceiling, Trump<br />and his policies would no longer be hindered by<br />congressional spending limits. With full control<br />of congress, it is more likely than not that the<br />trump administration will suspend the debt ceiling<br />by April 28th.","Isabella Molina (58%): While TikTok cannot<br />currently be installed in America due to the<br />suspension, it isn't banned just yet. This is<br />because Trump has granted TikTok an extension<br />to figure out what changes they will implement<br />to make the app safer to use. At this moment, it<br />seems the plan is to keep TikTok operational under<br />Trump's administration. They are in discussions<br />with the CEO of TikTok, along with other prominent<br />U.S. investors, to ensure the app remains in<br />America. Since the extension is roughly 75 days,<br />there should be an outcome before then regarding<br />TikTok's future. I assume the app will be allowed<br />to remain but with more American companies<br />involved in its operations. The question I do<br />wonder about is whether the new implementation of<br />TikTok will satisfy Congress enough to go along<br />with the plan.","Isabella Molina (45%): I chose 45 based on<br />the path it's going. It's common that the U.S.<br />Congress often raises or suspends the debt ceiling<br />before deadlines to avoid economic fallout, I<br />believe that it won't be suspended or abolished.<br />My main factor in this is the fact that the Fiscal<br />Responsibility Act already suspended the debt<br />ceiling through January 1, 2025, which means there<br />isn’t a reason to suspend or abolish it at this<br />moment since it was so recent. Because it has<br />been resolved until that date, lawmakers might<br />focus on other tasks at hand. I would also add<br />that due to Trump being in office, there could be<br />other distractions for them, making it less likely<br />they’ll take action to suspend or abolish the debt<br />ceiling earlier than required.","Jacob Weiss (60%): Tik tok is a massively popular<br />app to the younger generation there is high chance<br />elected officials will not do away with something<br />that will easily anger a large voting base. With<br />Elon Musk involvement in the administration and<br />X maybe he will be a possible buyer. There also<br />is a chance though that a buyer is not found<br />Republicans and Trump aren't liked by the Young<br />Voters anyway and Trumps animosity to China could<br />also result in a ban.","Jacob Weiss (90%): Considering president Trump's<br />history of spending and the Republican control<br />of Congress the US will most likely not to stop<br />spending money. If the US where to stop it would<br />be catastrophic for the economy.","James Martin (33%): I estimate a 40% probability<br />that TikTok will be available for download in the<br />United States on April 28th. President Trump’s<br />executive order has postponed the ban for 75<br />days to allow time for potential solutions. While<br />a U.S. company acquiring TikTok would bring it<br />back, the purchase would be very expensive, and<br />potential buyers with the capital have shown<br />little interest.","James Martin (20%): I think the probability the<br />US federal debt ceiling will be suspended or<br />abolished before April 28th is 20%. Based on<br />previous data, congress usually waits till the<br />very last minute to address the debt problem and<br />achieving political consensus is challenging.<br />However, the government is set to run out of their<br />borrowing power around June 2025 so it needs to<br />be addressed by then. I believe congress may take<br />a temporary measure to address the issue but not<br />totally suspended or abolished by April 28th.","Jenny Qiu (5%): TikTok has not been available<br />for download in the U.S. since mid-January.<br />Currently, it's still available for use on mobile<br />devices that already have the app downloaded.<br />However, if you delete it, you cannot get it back.<br />Since the law to ban the app was upheld by the<br />Supreme Court, Trump can only extend the period<br />allowing the app to operate, but he cannot prevent<br />the eventual ban. It is unlikely for Tiktok<br />to be \"more available\" than the current state<br />considering the ban can only be delayed or move<br />forward.","Jerusalem Greenberg (51%): I am fairly certain<br />that this will resolve positively and TikTok will<br />be downloadable again in the appstore. The use<br />and ability of people in the US to download TikTok<br />has been so politicized by the far right that the<br />right wing extremist government we have in place<br />right now is bound to use this to gain some points<br />with the frustrated left and desperate youth in<br />upcoming elections in 2026 and state elections<br />throughout. TikTok has already made a massive deal<br />out of its connection with Donald Trump and their<br />promise to work things out with him.","Jessy Lee (45%): At his point, Trump has put Tik<br />tok on a 75 day ban. Although many users have made<br />arguments over first amendment rights, the owner<br />of ByteDance is a Chinese citizen, therefore does<br />not have first amendment rights. While it is still<br />possible for someone to buy the app, I believe<br />the process even for that would not conclude until<br />after April 28.","Jessy Lee (55%): During Trump's presidency,<br />the debt ceiling was suspended multiple times,<br />and Trump signed bills that allowed for these<br />suspensions. For example, in 2017, a debt ceiling<br />suspension was passed as part of a broader package<br />that also included hurricane relief. He signed<br />these bills without pushing for specific spending<br />cuts or fiscal reforms in exchange for the<br />suspension. Also with many republicans in office<br />they could seek spending cuts or fiscal reforms<br />in exchange of raising or suspending the debt<br />ceiling.","Joey Khashan (58%): The federal debt ceiling<br />will be suspended because we have already reached<br />said ceiling. Trump has already expressed that he<br />would like to abolish the debt ceiling, and the<br />fact that it has already been reached means that<br />it is likely to either be abolished or suspended<br />before our April 28th deadline. However it is<br />also possible that the government waits until the<br />second half of the year to address this issue.","Joshua Kang (20%): The ban on tiktok is still in<br />place as of now. Even with Trump's executive order<br />that details an enforcement pause on the new bill<br />(that expires April 5), the bill still threatens<br />stiff penalties for any new download of the app<br />on US phones, after the enforcement pause. The<br />courts will likely not consider Trump's promises<br />to not enforce the bill to be legally binding. In<br />addition Apple's statement affirms that they will<br />follow the law. Short of a new bill or repealing<br />of the current bill, it seems unlikely TikTok<br />will be available for download before April 28, if<br />ever.","Joshua Kang (30%): As it stands right now, the<br />urgency of addressing the current US debt is not<br />severe. Compared to the crisis in 2023, there is<br />quite a bit more borrowed time concerning the debt<br />limit. At this point, it is likely that Congress<br />will wait for the spring to start moving on the<br />issue. If earlier action does take place, it seems<br />that a raising of the debt limit is more likely -<br />there is already internal conflict ongoing amongst<br />the Republican party over outright suspension or<br />abolition of the debt ceiling.","Julia Loggins (42%): The odds that TikTok will<br />be available to download in the United States on<br />April 28 is very slim. Although President Trump's<br />executive order bought TikTok some time, there<br />have been no significant efforts towards a sale of<br />the app. In addition, there seems to be no serious<br />talk of a legislative reversal taking place.<br />ByteDance has been firm in their unwillingness<br />to sell the app and I do not believe that the<br />extension will change their mind.","Julia Loggins (38%): I do not think the US federal<br />debt ceiling will be suspended or abolished<br />before April 28. The federal debt ceiling was<br />reestablished on January 1 based on the amount of<br />debt that existed. As of right now, the Treasury<br />is using extraordinary measures to keep the<br />government from defaulting which are supposed to<br />extend the government’s ability to borrow money<br />till mid-summer of 2025 according to Politico.<br />Some of these extraordinary measures include<br />tapping into financial resources of federal<br />retirement funds used to pay out civil service or<br />postal workers. Since the extraordinary measures<br />are not supposed to run out till mid-summer, I<br />do not think the federal debt ceiling will be<br />suspended or abolished before April 28.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (40%): I believe that it<br />is unlikely that TikTok will be available to<br />download in the U.S. by April 28th. I believe the<br />negotiation process for United States operation<br />ownership will be lengthy and will take longer<br />to resolve. Also, China must approve of the sale<br />of TikTok which I could see being an issue. I<br />do believe that Trump may issue another delay<br />once the current one ends that will keep the app<br />functional, but unavailable to download in the<br />United States.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (20%): I find it rather unlikely<br />that the federal debt ceiling will be suspended<br />or abolished by April 28th. Considering it was<br />just recently reinstated, it would be immensely<br />difficult for Congress to reach a decision that<br />would reverse this without any foreseen immediate<br />crisis. Additionally, the extreme political<br />polarization within Congress would impose<br />legislative gridlock that would be unlikely to<br />resolve in such a short period of time.","Kelsey Dyar (70%): I chose .7 because I think it<br />is quite likely that another company has already<br />bought TikTok or is in serious conversations with<br />TikTok leadership. It was suspicious to me how<br />quickly those of us who kept TikTok downloaded<br />were able to use it again after the 'ban' took<br />effect. As of right now, TikTok is not available<br />on the app store in the U.S. By April, I am sure<br />there will be a deal solidified and TikTok will be<br />able to be downloaded. Based off how quickly Trump<br />acted to fix the issue before, I believe it will<br />be fully resolved by April 28th.","Kelsey Dyar (10%): While Trump has called for<br />the debt ceiling to be abolished, I do not<br />think Congress is likely to actually do that.<br />Republicans, who are the majority in the House of<br />Representatives, typically like to use the debt<br />ceiling as a 'bargaining chip' to get what they<br />want. Democrats are against abolishing the debt<br />ceiling and I do not think enough republicans<br />will change their view because of what Trump wants<br />to happen. I do think it is possible for it to<br />be negotiated in the future, but 3 months is not<br />enough time for such a drastic shift.","Kyle Smith (55%): Trump already announced a plan<br />to heighten the tariffs to 25%. Although Canadian<br />officials are working to keep the tax low, I<br />believe we will see an increase of the tariffs<br />very soon. I do not think that these tariffs<br />will reach a level of 25% but I do see it being<br />increased due to the president expressing multiple<br />times that he plans on doing it.","Kyle Smith (67%): Tiktok has too many people<br />advising for its continuation to not be available<br />by late april. I believe that it will become<br />available to download even sooner than that due<br />to the whole nation and the president working<br />towards an agreement. Recently Trump has announced<br />a 75 day period to work out a solution and that is<br />early april. This would be before April 28th.","Lawton Smith (38%): This percentage depends on<br />whether ByteDance successfully negotiates a sale,<br />legal challenges overturn the ban, or political<br />decisions shift. However, without a confirmed<br />resolution, the ban is likely to remain in place.<br />Multiple businesses have wanted to buy ,but<br />ByteDance has repeatedly said it does not plan to<br />sell. The Chinese government is also very unlikely<br />to approve a sale that includes TikTok's coveted<br />algorithm to the United States. But with Trump<br />coming at bat for the app, because of a surge of<br />support from gen Z , it is not certain.","Lawton Smith (18%): Given the current political<br />dynamics, the probability of the debt ceiling<br />being suspended or abolished before April 28,<br />2025 will be low. While some GOP leaders are<br />considering a very detailed bipartisan deal that<br />includes a debt-limit increase, such negotiations<br />are complex and may not conclude swiftly.","Levi Thomas (35%): Companies like Apple are<br />unlikely to reinstate Tik Tok in their app stores<br />despite current assurances because they currently<br />have no reliable way to prevent from getting<br />fined if government opinion shifts back against<br />the app. The law Congress passed banning Tik Tok<br />has a statute of limitations of five years, which<br />means that even if Trump wishes to have the app<br />available in app stores, his predecessor could<br />disagree and subject companies like Apple to<br />billions of dollars in fines. The current legal<br />situation over Tik Tok’s status is also unclear.<br />Trump’s words and executive order are likely not<br />enough of an assurance legally speaking to prevent<br />companies from receiving fines if he suddenly<br />changes his mind.","Levi Thomas (60%): There have been discussions<br />among Republican lawmakers for a reconciliation<br />package that includes raising the federal<br />debt ceiling by some 1.5 trillion dollars, and<br />Republicans could hypothetically raise the debt<br />ceiling with minimal support from Democrats.<br />However, the slim majority in the House means that<br />the more fiscally Conservative representatives<br />could cause trouble for the potential raising of<br />the debt ceiling. Furthermore, the debt ceiling<br />presents an opportunity for leverage among<br />Democrat representatives as their support will<br />likely be needed to support any raising of the<br />debt ceiling.","Lillie Puhrmann (55%): TikTok has become a very<br />popular social media platform for millions in<br />the United States. Recently, many concerns have<br />come up based on the safety and security of<br />Americans leading to the ban of TikTok. I put<br />this probability because I feel that with Trump<br />being supportive of the platform, BryteDance will<br />take these 75 days to ensure that it can be used<br />safely in the United States. If the RESTRICT Act<br />is passed, though, I find that it may be difficult<br />for the app to return.","Lillie Puhrmann (35%): I picked this score of<br />probability because it captures the important<br />political divides we have, between opponents and<br />the interests of different political leaders.<br />Some leaders assert that they want to amend or<br />eliminate the debt cap, but previous attempts<br />to do so have faltered amid opposition from both<br />budget-savvy lawmakers as well as those who seek<br />more accountability over borrowing. Congress’s<br />current efforts may address the debt limit, but<br />it’s unclear and likely contentious, meaning it<br />won’t be resolved before the deadline.","Mabry Cartwright (68%): I believe that Tiktok<br />will be available on the app store by April 28.<br />Based on assumptions from Polymarket, people<br />believe that there is roughly a 68% chance.<br />I think it will be back for purchase and have<br />the same algorithm, but I believe it will be<br />sold before this happens. If Tiktok gains new<br />management/ownership, it will return to the app<br />store.","Mabry Cartwright (25%): I placed the probability<br />of the federal debt ceiling being suspended or<br />abolished relatively low. Donald Trump has pushed<br />for the ceiling to be abolished or raised, but<br />has received pushback. Furthermore, I see a higher<br />probability of the debt ceiling being raised than<br />suspended or abolished. Majority of political<br />market forecasts have the probability of the debt<br />ceiling being raised placed between 80-90%. On<br />the contrary, the market places the probability of<br />the debt ceiling being abolished/suspended between<br />20-30%.","Margaret Pope (47%): Whether or not Tik Tok<br />will be available for download on April 28 is<br />extremely difficult to predict. There is a lot<br />of uncertainty surrounding whether ByteDance<br />will commit to a sale and also whether or not<br />companies such as Google and Apple will reinstate<br />the apps availability until there is further<br />governmental action ensuring they are not sued.<br />Due to the massive uncertainty of ByteDance’s<br />willingness to divest, a unanimous Supreme Court<br />decision upholding the Protecting Americans from<br />Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,<br />and overwhelming bipartisan support for its ban in<br />Congress, I believe there is a 47% chance that Tik<br />Tok is not available for download in the United<br />States on April 28.","Margaret Pope (75%): I believe it is more likely<br />than not that the federal debt ceiling will be<br />suspended or abolished before April 28. Trump has<br />signaled his support for complete abolishment of<br />the debt ceiling which is something some democrats<br />also agree with. The Fiscal Responsibility Act<br />passed with bipartisan support in 2023 which<br />suspended the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025.<br />It is likely that congress will pass another<br />similar act, especially if Trump pushes for it.","Maston Corn (65%): President Trump delayed the<br />TikTok ban 75 days which win end on April 5th,<br />2025. If ByteDance sells 50 percent of its assets<br />to the United States or one of its allies within<br />the 75 days, then President Trump says that a<br />deal could be worked out. However, it is unknown<br />if Congress will be satisfied with this deal.<br />Nevertheless, China seems open to making a deal<br />with the United States or another country so that<br />TikTok will remain available in the United States.<br />There are also many celebrities and tech companies<br />within the United States who have offered to<br />purchase some of the assets.","Maston Corn (40%): It is likely that the U.S.<br />federal debt ceiling will be suspended before<br />the debt ceiling is reached in mid-2025 but,<br />it is very unlikely that the debt ceiling will<br />be abolished altogether as that would require<br />a large consensus. The debt ceiling has been<br />suspended multiple times from 2013 until now and<br />it is likely that the debt ceiling will again be<br />suspended before the middle of the year. However,<br />I am not sure that the debt ceiling will be<br />suspended as early as April 28th. The debt ceiling<br />has never been suspended that early as it is<br />usually suspended between June and November.","Meera Srinivasan (20%): It remains unclear whether<br />or not the sale will go through, but it seems<br />that tech giants, such as Google and Apple, are<br />hesitant to host the app on their app stores as<br />it remains in this legal limbo. Despite President<br />Trump’s assurance that companies will not face<br />fines for hosting TikTok on their services, Google<br />and Apple stand to lose hundreds of billions<br />of dollars if those fines were to be imposed at<br />any time. Given the legal challenges faced by<br />Bytedance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, including<br />TikTok, it stands to reason that tech giants such<br />as Google and Apple will not risk the financial<br />losses that could be incurred via hosting the<br />app. Thus, it seems likely that TikTok will not be<br />available to download in the app stores on April<br />28th, 2025. However, it is not completely out of<br />the realm of possibility, especially if President<br />Trump were to assist an American company in<br />forging a deal with ByteDance Ltd.","Mia Pisani (23%): Members of Congress have had<br />concerns of TikTok usage in the United States<br />since 2019. They called for an investigation of<br />the app in October 2019 following TikTok's $5.7<br />million settlement concerning U.S. child-privacy<br />laws. In 2020, the Pentagon prohibited military<br />personnel from having the app installed on their<br />phones. The U.S. government seems to be very<br />against TikTok, although both Donald Trump and<br />Kamala Harris used it as a campaign tool, although<br />in April of 2024, Biden signed legislation<br />requiring ByteDance to sell to a US owner within<br />a year or to shut down. The Supreme Court upheld<br />this law, which leads me to believe Trump will not<br />have much power in \"saving\" TikTok. His executive<br />order granted a 75 day extension for TikTok to<br />comply with the buy or ban law, but ByteDance has<br />said several times previously they do not intend<br />to sell the app.","Mia Pisani (71%): Trump called for the abolishment<br />of the debt ceiling after he was elected. His<br />pick for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said<br />\"the United States is not going to default on its<br />debt if I'm confirmed.\" Bessent also said he would<br />work with Trump to eliminate the debt ceiling.<br />Some Democrats in Congress support this plan. The<br />national debt currently stands at $36.2 trillion,<br />which exceeds the $36.1 trillion ceiling instated<br />on January 2nd. The ceiling was suspended from<br />June 2023 until January 1st, 2025. Suspensions<br />are not uncommon; during Trump's first presidency<br />the debt ceiling was suspended several times.<br />With the confirmation of Bessent and Trump's calls<br />to abolish the debt ceiling, I find it likely a<br />suspension will happen in the near future.","Milan Yadav (77%): TikTok's ban delay by Trump is<br />set to be done on Apr 5, 2025. As of this week,<br />Microsoft has allegedly begun talks to buy TikTok,<br />and this will lift any restrictions if it occurs.<br />However, as long as the Chinese company Byte<br />Dance owns the app, no updates or new downloads<br />can happen on US users of the app. This will<br />\"degrade\" the app over time since bug fixes and<br />other important updates/refreshes won't happen.<br />Oracle and Walmart already tried to buy TikTok in<br />2020, but were denied by the Biden admin. Trump<br />being a close ally of Elon Musk and other tech<br />giants based in the US could mean a deal for a<br />US corporation to acquire TikTok could be in the<br />works very soon. Trump stated that the US just<br />needs a 50% ownership of TikTok for it to be<br />good to go in the US. For now, Apple and Google<br />still have the app removed from the app stores<br />as they are awaiting some extra protections since<br />distributing the app could be seen as malicious as<br />long as it is China-owned (\"Protecting Americans<br />from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications<br />Act\"). In all honesty, the fact that Trump and<br />Biden both have their own official accounts on<br />TikTok says a lot about America's love for the<br />app, and so I think it will be re-downloadable<br />soon.","Milan Yadav (15%): “The debt ceiling is the limit<br />Congress has set up to which Treasury Dep't can<br />borrow.\" The debt ceiling suspension expired on<br />Jan 1, 2025. The US can technically face a default<br />between Jun-Aug this year if Congress does not<br />act swiftly on this. However, the US has not had<br />a true default before but has come close during<br />political standoffs. Lawmakers have suspended<br />the debt limit 8 times since 2013 (most recently<br />in Jun 2023). Therefore, it is highly unlikely<br />that the ceiling will not be raised soon. Most<br />GOP members will support a debt ceiling increase<br />only if the gov't were to use the new increased<br />money on the right things in their eyes. Lastly,<br />the most recent times where th debt ceiling had<br />tobe acted on, Congress made a final decision just<br />days before the deadline, so in this case I highly<br />doubt a decision will be made in April.","Nathaniel Long (20%): Currently, TikTok is<br />unavailable to download in the U.S. even though<br />the app is not banned. Donald Trump's executive<br />order mearly extended the time before the ban ends<br />to April 5th, 2025, but cannot restore the app's<br />position on the app store or its availability to<br />download. While Donald Trump had the power to undo<br />the ban by executive order, he would likely need<br />considerable time after April 5th to form a case<br />to the reinstatement of TikTok, making it unlikely<br />that the app will be available to download until<br />much later in 2025.","Nathaniel Long (24%): According to CNN, Donald<br />Trump directly stated that he wishes to remove the<br />debt ceiling altogether to further his plans to<br />increase tax cuts. This opinion seems not to be<br />shared by many of his political allies nor many of<br />the opposite party, meaning that his plans could<br />likely be scuppered without a full body of support<br />behind them. The likelihood of his plans coming to<br />fruition is not 0, but it is quite low considering<br />the lack of support for the idea of debt ceiling<br />abolition.","Niomi Nurse (95%): Tik Tok will be available for<br />download in the United States because the initial<br />ban of the app has already been passed. It is<br />highly likely that the app has been purchased by<br />an American company, which is why the app is still<br />available. There is speculation that Tik Tok will<br />be merged with Meta apps such as Instagram and<br />Facebook.","Niomi Nurse (20%): I do not think the debt ceiling<br />will be abolished or suspended because it was just<br />recently reinstated until January 1, 2025. The<br />U.S. Treasury often takes 'extraordinary measures'<br />to keep the U.S. debt from reaching a certain<br />limit. The government is in constant need of money<br />and the White House and Congress need to agree<br />with giving the federal government more money when<br />it is needed.","Pablo Martinez (10%): How long does an enforcement<br />pause last? how long does it take for a law to be<br />reversed? Trump's enforcement period ends on April<br />25, 2025, and for a law to be reversed, it usually<br />takes a few months or even years with the entire<br />system having to work together! Stores like Apple<br />and Google refuse to put TikTok in their stores<br />as the law upheld by the Supreme Court and signed<br />by Joe Biden, fines companies who have TikTok in<br />their store. I think at some point we might get<br />it back, but it will take months even years before<br />something happens as the process is long and an<br />April 28th return seems unlikely","Quintin Gallardo (70%): Despite the overwhelming<br />resistance from Vance to sell TikTok and its<br />algorithm to a US own company, I believe that<br />there’s a strong likelihood of a US owned company<br />taking the bite and purchasing the app. This would<br />allow for the download of TikTok in the US by<br />April 28. With the deadline from Trump‘s executive<br />order expiring in roughly 70 days, they will<br />either have to or lose US support which is roughly<br />60% of their market. Several bids have been placed<br />by Microsoft and Jimmy Donaldson.","Quintin Gallardo (20%): In regards to whether or<br />not, the United States will suspend or abolish<br />the federal debt ceiling, I’m hesitant to say<br />that they would because the previous suspension<br />ended on December 31 less than a month ago. Since<br />the suspension of the ceiling was introduced in<br />2013, there has been only 7 instances of it going<br />into effect. Though it is unlikely, for this<br />reason, Trump has shown interest in an additional<br />suspension. Finally, in regards to an abolishment<br />of the federal debt ceiling, I strongly doubt such<br />would occur, especially at the beginning of a new<br />term.","Rebecca Mcadam (60%): Trump signed an executive<br />order giving TikTok 75 days of wiggle room to<br />address the security dilemmas with its algorithm.<br />This means, by April, TikTok needs to sell to a<br />US buyer in order to return to the App Store or<br />the company will face harsh tariffs. I think it is<br />highly likely that TikTok will be sold before then<br />because the company is so valuable","Rebecca Mcadam (55%): Since Trump and Senate<br />Republicans are pushing for the current debt<br />crisis to be handled, it is likely that Congress<br />will raise, if not suspend, the debt ceiling at<br />some point in 2025. However, I don't know if it<br />will be as early as April, since Trump has spoken<br />about the ceiling being suspended in June. The<br />ceiling will need to be raised before then, but<br />maybe not suspended.","Riley Batz (70%): Though Trump signed an executive<br />order temporarily \"saving\" TikTok, it remains<br />unclear when TikTok will return to app stores in<br />the U.S. Users might have to wait until the tech<br />giants receive additional legal protections to<br />host the app or until ByteDance sells its U.S.<br />assets — a process that could happen anytime<br />before April 5, 2025, when Trump’s enforcement<br />pause is set to expire. Under a law passed<br />by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court,<br />TikTok must execute what is known as \"qualified<br />divestiture\" from ByteDance in order to stay<br />in business in the U.S. Currently, Trump is<br />reportedly talking deals with Oracle- which could<br />effectively mean American investors would own a<br />majority stake in TikTok. Given Trump said he was<br />going to \"save TikTok\" and his executive order<br />expires before the semester ends, it is likely<br />that he will instigate a sale, that of which<br />would made TikTok available to download on the app<br />store.","Riley Batz (70%): Congress has suspended the<br />debt limit five times since January 2016.<br />Currently, a dozen GOP senators and 49 House<br />Republicans — more than 20% of each conference<br />— have never previously voted for a law raising<br />the debt ceiling, according to an analysis of<br />roll call votes and data from the Congressional<br />Research Service. A Republican Congress voted<br />to suspend the debt limit three times during<br />Trump’s first term as part of broader spending<br />bills, and it is likely to occur again as Congress<br />deals with its fiscal issues this Spring. Trump<br />has proposed abolishing the debt ceiling all<br />together, something some GOP Senators seem to be<br />on board with. Either way- it seems as though a<br />federal debt ceiling is likely to be suspended or<br />abolished by late April.","Sarah Joyce (25%): Although Trump has expressed<br />that he wants to save TikTok and he has an<br />executive order extending ByteDance’s window to<br />divest, I am pretty uncertain about the future<br />of TikTok. The ban has had bipartisan support in<br />Congress, which makes it pretty certain that the<br />ban will continue to be enforced if ByteDance<br />does not find outside investors before the end<br />of Trump’s extension in April. Interestingly,<br />NPR released a report that the administration had<br />been in talks with Oracle and other investors to<br />take over TikTok, but Trump has denied this, only<br />saying he has spoken to “many people.”","Sarah Joyce (30%): I think there is some<br />likelihood that the federal debt ceiling will be<br />suspended or abolished. Trump has made it clear<br />that he sees this as something of high importance,<br />and he does have major influence over Republicans<br />on many issues, but he already did not manage to<br />get the debt ceiling suspension to continue when<br />it was debated in December. I think it is more<br />likely that it will be raised than it actually<br />being suspended or abolished, especially not<br />before April 28th.","Sreya Pandyaram (66%): This marks the second time<br />TikTok has been in discussions to be acquired by<br />a U.S. company. The first deal fell through due<br />to factors such as political pressure, government<br />disapproval, and China’s general reluctance to<br />sell. However, today, Trump appears more open<br />to cooperating with the platform, stating in<br />Bloomberg Technology that TikTok helped him<br />secure the younger vote. He has also proposed a<br />50/50 partnership, which may be a more favorable<br />arrangement than previous attempts. Given his<br />revised stance on TikTok and his imposed 90-day<br />deadline, the deal has a stronger chance of<br />materializing within this timeframe. Additionally,<br />while mergers and acquisitions typically take<br />several months, the familiarity between the<br />involved parties could expedite the process.","Sreya Pandyaram (32%): While it is rare for the US<br />federal debt ceiling to be completely abolished,<br />there is an agreement between the democrats<br />and the republicans for the idea to abolish it,<br />recently. However, a suspension is more likely<br />and with pressures like the California Fires, and<br />partisan conflict it is a likely possibility. With<br />Trump in office, there is pressure to follow his<br />lead but there are many of his party members ,as<br />reported by NBC, that refuse to support a debt<br />ceiling increase. Making it difficult for Trump<br />to follow through on his agenda due to internal<br />fissures. Also it was reported by AP that a bill<br />to suspend the debt ceiling was rejected, however,<br />The Hill reports that this was because the parties<br />were in fierce opposition due to wanting to<br />maintain face and other criteria before elections.<br />Therefore with internal conflicts and a grey area<br />for negotiation it is unlikely the ceiling will<br />rise, and there may be a suspension. Also it is<br />important to take into account Trump's reputation<br />as well. I would say a raise is more likely,<br />because a suspension","Thomas Smith (65%): With the Trump administration<br />showing a great affinity for bytedance to find a<br />United States owner it seems only inevitable that<br />TikTok with remain available to download in the<br />United States. This would be a great pr stunt for<br />Trump and would be a fulfilled promise on his part<br />as he pledged to save the app","Thomas Smith (35%): I think it’s far more possible<br />the debt ceiling is raised rather than outright<br />suspended or abolished. There are a powerful<br />gop minority in the house that are very against<br />suspension or abolishing the debt ceiling. These<br />holdouts and the fact that the ceiling was just<br />recently reinstated make it hard for me to believe<br />it will be suspended or abolished in the following<br />months","Tiyanah Rowtham (30%): Tiktok is currently<br />unavailable to download in the United States. In<br />April 2024, President Biden signed the Protecting<br />Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled<br />Applications Act, which required ByteDance to<br />sell to a U.S. owned company. President Trump<br />assured to try to get Tiktok back in the app<br />store, leading them to restore services for 75<br />days (ending in early April). I estimate that<br />Tiktok will restore operations by April 28, 2025<br />as 30%, because the Supreme Court also upheld the<br />validity of the Act in early January. This shows<br />me that there is a slim chance that Tiktok will<br />be unbanned. Furthermore, ByteDance, the Chinese<br />Parent Company, has expressed multiple times that<br />they do not plan on selling their company.","Townsend Turner (15%): This ban has been in the<br />works since at least spring of last year, so any<br />effects from the bill itself can be expected to<br />be a bit lasting at least. President Trump seems<br />to have already done what he is willing to do to<br />help out so it does not seem like he will change<br />this. Finally, selling TikTok to a United States<br />company, the only other plausible option, would be<br />a massive deal and therefore would probably take<br />some time, more than just a couple months.","Townsend Turner (20%): Raising the debt ceiling<br />is a relatively frequent occurrence, having<br />happened around 90 times in the past, so one would<br />think that this would be the move to counter any<br />debt struggles. Suspension of the debt ceiling,<br />since it began in 2013, has occurred 7 times,<br />and the last suspension ended this month, so the<br />odds of it being resuspended so soon after the<br />last one ends is low. Also, the chance that it<br />is completely abolished in the next few months<br />is minuscule due to the national debt’s status<br />as a controversial debate in politics. However,<br />President Trump has made a few moves that suggest<br />that he wants the debt to be a topic he does not<br />have to worry about at all as he begins his second<br />term.","Tristan Thompson (66%): Donald Trump’s executive<br />order to reverse the ban of TikTok will last for<br />75 days, meaning the government has roughly two<br />and a half months to reach a deal with TikTok’s<br />parent company ByteDance. Based on comments<br />made by the president, those close to him, and<br />ByteDance director Bill Ford, it seems that all<br />parties involved are eager to reach a deal in the<br />near future. Given this information, I believe<br />the app will be available for download in some<br />capacity on April 28.","Tristan Thompson (45%): The federal debt ceiling<br />was reinstated on January 1st, 2025, after<br />being suspended in 2023. There has not been much<br />coverage on what will possibly happen to the<br />debt ceiling; however, I believe that it will<br />remain more likely than not. I do not think that<br />the government would want to suspend or abolish<br />the ceiling so soon after its reinstatement,<br />especially as President Trump has made it a point<br />to reduce federal spending, the Debt Ceiling would<br />be an advantageous metric to point to so that<br />it can be shown that the federal government is<br />abiding to a budget.","Vangeli Tsiaras (60%): President Donald Trump on<br />his first day in office signed an executive order<br />to delay TikTok's national ban for 75 days. He has<br />greatly softened his view on the application from<br />his first term as President as he has acknowledged<br />his own presence on the social media platform as a<br />reason to why he performed historically well with<br />the 18- to 29-year-old age demographic and won<br />overall with men of this age bracket. Trump has<br />made multiple other statements claiming that he<br />will \"save\" the app. I believe that it is Trump's<br />main objective for the app to be ultimately sold<br />to an American company or to be partly owned by an<br />American company.","Vangeli Tsiaras (60%): After Donald Trump's<br />Presidential victory, he endorsed the idea of<br />either substantially raising or suspending the<br />debt ceiling. The current U.S. debt ceiling which<br />was just reinstated on January 2nd has a figure of<br />about 36.1 million dollars. House Minority Leader<br />Hakeem Jeffries has also said he would be willing<br />to work with Trump and other Republicans to find a<br />solution to the issue.","Wyatt Dasher (35.7%): I just think that there<br />is no rush with trumps extension and that there<br />is going to be legal/political battles over<br />everything. Plus if the company sells it will need<br />time for negotiations. I used a EBT and felt that<br />35.7 was a conferrable bet. This if from research<br />I found on the matter.","Wyatt Dasher (75%): Due to historical precedent,<br />it seems reasonable that there will be a<br />suspension or abolishment to the debt ceiling.<br />This because of trumps remarks about abolishing<br />the debt ceiling. Then looking at historical data<br />I gathered that the second most likely month is<br />in January (the first month being august). So, if<br />it was going to happen it would happen before the<br />April 28th deadline or closer to august. Given<br />that there is political change in January it seems<br />that January may be the month.","Wyatt Stevenson (90%): Due to the recent public<br />response of TikTok's stoppage, there has been<br />a lot of talk that suggests that TikTok will be<br />downloadable very soon. Despite Trump's opinion<br />on wanting the application back, there are rumors<br />that Microsoft has interest in buying TikTok out.<br />This will allow mobile device users to gain access<br />back to TikTok. There might be a change in the<br />algorithm because of the administrative control,<br />but it seems as it will be in everyone's best<br />interest if the app is accessible.","Wyatt Stevenson (40%): Due to the debt ceiling<br />being reinstated on January 1st, I believe the<br />probability of another suspension will be low.<br />Also with the policies that Trump has implemented,<br />there does not seem to be much reason for the<br />federal government to be borrowing money.","Teya Hagy (78%): Tik tok is available on google<br />and if people did not delete it off of their<br />phones prior to the ban.

President Trump has already issued a 25%<br />tariff on all imports coming in from Canada, only<br />excluding energy imports, which only goes to show<br />that the tax rates for Canadian tariffs will be<br />much higher than 10%.","Addisen Kameron (90%): With Trump’s new trade war<br />I think there is a 90% chance the tariff rate on<br />Canadian exports to the US will still be higher<br />than 10% on March 1. His 25% tariffs on Canada go<br />into effect on Tuesday and I don’t see anything<br />stopping that train. He convinced his base that<br />tariffs are a good move and I personally don’t<br />see him backing off by March 1st regardless of the<br />fact that they’ll be disastrous for the American<br />people. Trump won’t back down from a fight, not<br />this quickly and not with this many lap dogs<br />supporting him.","Andreas Papandreou (80%): Trump is expected to<br />place 25% tariffs on Canada on 2/1/25. Canada is<br />expected to fight back against these tariffs by<br />placing their own tariffs on US goods entering<br />their country. Due to this potential trade war<br />it is very likely that the effective tariff rate<br />remains above 10% by March 1st.","Andy Wyatt (65%): On Saturday, Trump ordered a<br />25% tariff on imports from Canada and a lower<br />10% tariff on energy products. Canada has already<br />retaliated against the U.S. with a 25% counter<br />tariff. Taken together, the trade situation will<br />hit American consumers and businesses that export<br />goods to Canada. However, it will take some time<br />before prices increase to a noticeable degree.<br />Between that fact and that tariffs are brand<br />new, it will take time before the administration<br />removes them. In all likelihood, tariffs will<br />not stick around all that long, but it’s unclear<br />whether March 1 is within that window.","Anna Rachwalski (85%): Donald Trump is not one<br />to back down from getting what he wants–and here,<br />it's total submission from Canada (and Mexico). Do<br />not think that will happen by March 1, especially<br />with a new Canadian PM coming in. It'll look good<br />for whoever that is to not back down.","Archita Gaur (78%): Trump signed three executive<br />orders on tariffs. One of those is a 25% tariff on<br />imported Canadian goods. Trump also said on Jan.<br />31 that the U.S. tariffs will be lower on Canada’s<br />oil and gas exports, at 10%, while other goods<br />will have a tariff of 25%. Trudeau addresses this<br />directly and said he would implement a 25% tariff<br />against $155 billion in U.S. goods. That's why I<br />think it will be higher than 10%.","Ava Herring (90%): I believe that this is<br />extremely likely to happen, considering that the<br />United States currently has a 25% tariff rate<br />on Canadian exports as of today. There is no<br />indication that trade policy will change or lower<br />before March 1. It is not likely that there will<br />be any sort of policy change before the deadline<br />of March 1, so I think that there is a very high<br />chance that the tariff rate will remain higher<br />than 10% until March 1.","Ayaan Fazal (75%): I believe that this is highly<br />likely because Trump has been pushing towards this<br />effort. Just recently, I believe a tax of 25% was<br />placed on Canada as well as Mexico. This tax might<br />even increase from its previous rate.","Bailey Mattox (63%): He's said that he's going to<br />raise tariffs to 25% but he seems wishy washy on<br />the date and I think its possible that he raises<br />the tariffs, but public backlash regarding the<br />increasing price of goods could make him less<br />likely to follow through. He also could very well<br />end up striking a deal with Canada to bring their<br />tariffs back down to 10%. Trudeau has already said<br />that he is planning to retaliate if Trump follows<br />through.","Bennie Trujillano (45%): Considering the current<br />trade war, I think seeing the tariff grow by 10%<br />by March 1st is unlikely but it could happen. The<br />United States is currently fighting with China,<br />Canada, and Mexico while receiving heavy backlash<br />from the European Union as well. However, if Trump<br />keeps picking fights, I'd assume everyone is going<br />to keep raising tariffs.","Brooke Cheney (65%): In doing research, I could<br />not find any information about effective tax<br />rates, which is my main area of hesitation in my<br />prediction. However, given Trump has implemented<br />a 25% tariff set to go in place on February 4th,<br />I presume this will stay in effect past March<br />1. It appears that the effective tariff rate<br />for developed countries is usually lower than<br />the tariff rate due to free trade agreements.<br />Therefore, I find it not probable that the<br />effective tariff rate will be 15% lower than the<br />tariff rate.","Chinelo Ireh (100%): Since his 2024 campaign,<br />President Trump has promised to increase tariffs<br />on Mexico and Canada to prevent the flow of<br />illegal drugs and undocumented people into<br />America. Since he entered office on January 20<br />of this year, he has followed through on all<br />the measures he promised to implement. But on<br />Saturday February 1, President Trump implemented<br />a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico.<br />These will go into effect very soon and President<br />Sheinbaum and Prime Minister Trudeau have already<br />announced retaliatory action against the increase<br />in tariffs.","Chloe Cooper (97%): On February 1st of this<br />year President Trump signed an Executive Order<br />that will place new tariffs on Canada, adding an<br />additional 25% tariff rate on goods from Canada.<br />This order is set to go into effect on February<br />4th, meaning for this question to resolve in no,<br />Canada would have to come to an agreement with<br />the United States and enact said agreement before<br />March 1st. The chances of this happening are very<br />unlikely as Canada has already started retaliating<br />with tariffs of their own, looking like there<br />will be a back and forth struggle for a bit until<br />anything is resolved. There is still a possibility<br />of the two countries coming to an agreement but it<br />seems highly unlikely in such a short time frame.","Da In Song (95%): International, political, and<br />diplomatic repurcussions come slower than current<br />economic effects. Trump's previous administration,<br />while in office, kept high tariffs on lumber.<br />Average lumber tariff didn't fall 8% during<br />Biden's administration. Congress will take time to<br />de-codify the tariff power they handed over to the<br />executive office (time for a bill to pass).","Diane Johnson (90%): Trudeau’s response insinuates<br />that neither he nor Trump will back down and at<br />the expense of both country’s citizens. I believe<br />that eventually there will be resistance from<br />the citizens and then from corporations to start<br />changing. This kind of change takes a long time<br />to see results and one month is not enough time to<br />reduce the tariff back to below 10%. It will get<br />worse before it gets better. There is also regular<br />inflation that is occurring so even if there is<br />a peaceful agreement to end this war, the final<br />tariff rate might remain higher than 10%.","Eli Henderson (65%): While this question heavily<br />relies on tariffs still being in place in a<br />month's time, It would seem more likely than not<br />that this will be the case, and might even be<br />more by that time. As of now, Canada has already<br />promised to impose retaliatory tariffs on the<br />US. In response, Trump has indicated he would be<br />willing to escalate the trade war, which would<br />certainly put the effective tariff rate over 10%.","Elliana Williams (65%): Yes, the effective tariff<br />rate on canadian exports, or the the percentage<br />increase in the value added to a product due to<br />tariffs on both the final product and its imported<br />inputs will be higher than 10% on March 1st. There<br />is a 65% chance. As of February 1st, 2025, Trump<br />has imposed a 25% tariff rate on imports from<br />Canada and Mexico. I cannot see him reversing<br />his decision in one month. However, since the<br />US and Canada have such an interlinked economic<br />relationship, if there is serious push back and<br />resistance, I could see Trump changing the policy<br />via executive order.","Emma Allen (95%): On February 1, 2025, the U.S.<br />announced that it is imposing tariffs of 25% on<br />Canadian goods, and a tariff of 10% on energy<br />exports from Canada, imported into the U.S. from<br />Canada effective February 4, 2025. Therefore,<br />unless there are changes to this policy, the 25%<br />tariff on Canadian exports will remain in place<br />on March 1, 2025. Additionally, Canada has already<br />imposed a retaliatory tariff. I think if there<br />are reductions of these tariff rates, it will take<br />some time to negotiate and will not happen before<br />March 1.","Emma Pastor (90%): Given that Trump just signed<br />an executive order on Saturday that will be<br />implemented on Tuesday (2/4) regarding tariffs<br />above 10% on imports from Canada, Mexico, and<br />China, I believe the probability that the tariffs<br />rate on Canadian exports will be above 10% on<br />March 1st is very high.","Emma Peterson (80%): Trump just announced he would<br />be instituting a 25% tariff rate on exports from<br />Canada and Mexico. It goes into effect Tuesday<br />according to CBS. The Canadian Prime Minister<br />came out and retaliated with a 25% tax on American<br />goods as well to adapt for new change. The only<br />thing is they could bring down the tariffs once<br />the government realizes they aren't going to<br />provide the American people with any reduced fees.<br />I do believe by March 1st it'll still be higher<br />than 10%, but I do think it will be changed over<br />the next few weeks.","Ethan Marcum (100%): As of yesterday, President<br />Trump did in fact sign an executive order that<br />imposed a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, as<br />well as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy. This<br />does not surprise me, as President Trump indicated<br />this is as a viable option if he were to make<br />it into office. Many are speculating that this<br />is the beginning of a trade war, and it seems<br />like that is possible; especially with Canadian<br />Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, imposing a<br />retaliation tariff this morning. However, I do<br />not feel that President Trump will redact said<br />tariffs. This claim is mainly due to two reasons:<br />his desire to end illegal immigration, and his<br />steadfast ideology that tariffs will aid domestic<br />industries.","Grace Reichelderfer (95%): White House press<br />secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president<br />would put a 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico<br />and a 10 percent tariff on goods from China during<br />a briefing on Friday. The tariffs, which are<br />expected to take effect on Tuesday, include a 25%<br />duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods<br />from Canada. It seems highly probable that these<br />tariffs on Canada will be implemented in the next<br />week. By March 1st, I am almost certain that these<br />tariffs will be implemented.","Hampton Barrineau (75%): I understand that Trump<br />will use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining<br />chip in international negotiations. His “BS” hard<br />ask negotiation skills are covered in his “Art<br />of The Deal” but he hasn’t made much a of a clear<br />ask of Canada and he was very serious about other<br />tariffs like for that of China.","Hannah Carson (65%): Right now, President Trump<br />raised Canadian tariffs to 25% in an effort to<br />stop illegal drug trafficking from Canada. Canada<br />has retaliated with tariff's against the US,<br />starting a trade war of sorts. I have a hard time<br />believing that Trump is going to back down and<br />lower trade costs against Canada until they drop<br />the tariffs on our country. Especially because<br />he said when asked about the Canadian tariff<br />\"war\", \"But if they want to play the game, I<br />don't mind. We can play the game all they want.\"<br />It is a little less than a month until March 1st<br />and things would slow in the government and legal<br />world. Therefore, I think it is highly unlikely<br />that the effective tariff rate on Canadian exports<br />will be lower than 10% by March 1st.","Isaac Fleischer (80%): Currently, Donald Trump has<br />imposed a 25% tariff rate on all Canadian goods<br />(except energy exports). It is unlikely that this<br />tariff rate will be significantly lowered within<br />the next month, as the effects of the policy will<br />take time to develop. Trump has been vocal about<br />his intention to impose high tariffs on our trade<br />partners and does not seem likely to change his<br />policy for some time. Because of this, the 25%<br />tariff will probably not be reduced to 10% by<br />March 1.","Isabella Molina (99%): Yes, as of March 1, 2025,<br />the effective tariff rate on Canadian exports to<br />the United States is higher than 10%. On February<br />1, 2025, President Donald Trump decided to sign<br />an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all<br />imports from Canada. Trump also imposed tariffs<br />on Mexico and is planning to extend more tariffs<br />throughout other countries. These tariffs took<br />effect on February 4, 2025.","Jake Garrard (78%): President Donald Trump<br />has imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian imports on<br />February 1st, while this means that currently this<br />prediction would be 100%, by March 1st many things<br />can still change, especially now that there is a<br />hurry to resolve the issue. I believe that it is<br />still likely that these tariffs are in effect on<br />March 1st, but there is a chance they are resolved<br />before then.","Jenny Qiu (75%): Trump, in his view, is determined<br />to decrease dependence on imports to boost<br />domestic companies. He has signed executive<br />orders to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and<br />China. Currently, the tariff rate on most Canadian<br />imports will be 25%, effective on Tuesday Feb.<br />4th. Although Canada has responded that it will<br />impose similar tariffs on American goods in<br />retaliation, I do not see Trump revoking these<br />tariffs by March 1. If he revokes his policy too<br />quickly, it will showcase his resolve as weak. I<br />think the high tariff rate will last past March 1.","Jerusalem Greenberg (40%): The US has received<br />retaliatory tariffs from a number of countries,<br />including (but not limited to) Canada. The list<br />of tariffed goods from Canada includes currently<br />many household groceries like poultry, eggs,<br />other meat goods, and produce -- things that<br />people were voting Trump into office to have the<br />price reduced. A 25% tariff rate is absolutely<br />ridiculous (this will be the rate going into<br />February 4th), and because of Trump's history<br />of going black or white on issues, when problems<br />arise, he'll likely back down the tariffs<br />completely.","Jessy Lee (95%): The order for effective tariff<br />rate of 25% on Canadian exports to the United<br />States has been signed by Trump on Saturday Feb<br />2. This is supposedly going into effect on Tuesday<br />Feb 4. With Canada's statement on imposing tariffs<br />on the exportation of US goods to Canada, I<br />believe it just reinforces his decision.","Joey Khashan (90%): Considering the fact that<br />President Trump has enacted a 25% tariff on all<br />imported goods from Canada, it is highly likely<br />that the tariff rate will be above 10%. However,<br />the question uses the phrase “ON March 1” rather<br />than “BY March 1” meaning that it's possible<br />that the rates go below 10% before then. I do not<br />believe that this situation will be resolved in<br />one short month.","Joshua Kang (65%): President Trump has implemented<br />new tariff rates, with America's closest neighbors<br />- Mexico and Canada - each getting hit with 25%<br />tariff rates on most imports. Although there is a<br />chance that it may be repealed, Trump is seemingly<br />ready for the sheer economic fallout that may<br />ensue from this - he stated recently that although<br />the tariffs might cause \"some pain\", it \"will be<br />worth it to Make America Great Again\". It seems he<br />is committed to keeping the tariffs in place as a<br />result.","Julia Loggins (87%): I think the U.S. tariff rate<br />on Canadian exports to the U.S. will be higher<br />than 10% on March 1. CBC news stated that the<br />White House press secretary said the President<br />would put a 25 percent tariff on Canada with<br />President Trump saying it will happen around<br />February 18. Nonetheless, Trump levied for a 10%<br />tariff on Canadian energy imports but the 25%<br />tariff remains for Canadian goods.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (70%): I believe that because<br />President Trump has already imposed 25% tariffs,<br />it is unlikely that these will be lowered by<br />such a steep margin in less than a month's time.<br />However, I do believe that at or below 10% tariffs<br />may be seen a little later in the year, depending<br />on trade negotiations and economic pressures.","Kelsey Dyar (90%): Currently, the US and Canada<br />are battling with tariffs. Canada's leadership<br />has said that they would remain firm in the<br />battle against Trump. On February 1st, the US<br />imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian goods. Due to<br />the stubbornness of both sides, I do not think<br />that will change in the next month. I think it is<br />highly likely that the tariff rate will be 25% on<br />March 1st.","Kyle Smith (78%): Trump already announced a plan<br />to heighten the tariffs to 25%. Although this is<br />the case, both American and Canadian officials<br />are working towards solutions. There has been<br />a very limited number of times in history when<br />the tariffs went above 10%. With the efforts of<br />both countries and the efforts of the World Trade<br />Organization there is a very low chance of a<br />tariff rate that high. (As of recent news there<br />has been a comfirmation of these tariffs)","Lawton Smith (63%): The effective tariff rate on<br />Canadian exports to the U.S. on March 1, 2025, is<br />expected to be 20-25%, as most Canadian goods are<br />now subject to a 25% tariff, while only energy<br />exports (crude oil, natural gas, and electricity)<br />receive a lower 10% rate. Since energy exports<br />make up a significant but not majority share<br />of Canada’s total exports, the weighted average<br />tariff rate is well above 10%. This policy,<br />aimed at protecting U.S. industries, is expected<br />to increase costs for businesses and consumers<br />while escalating trade tensions between the two<br />countries. I would have to say they last at least<br />a month.","Levi Thomas (85%): The recent establishment of<br />25% tariffs imposed against Canada by the U.S.<br />and the subsequent retaliatory tariffs that Canada<br />has imposed on U.S. goods means that the effective<br />tariff rate on Canadian exports will likely be<br />above 10% on March 1. Past trade wars indicate<br />that this tariff situation will not be solved in a<br />short amount of time. Even if outside institutions<br />like the World Trade Organization are contacted to<br />expedite the process, the deescalation of tariffs<br />would still take longer than March 1.","Lillie Puhrmann (85%): Since the United States has<br />imposed tariffs exceeding 10% on Canadian exports<br />by February 4, 2025, I believe there is a high<br />chance this will occur. Trade negotiations do take<br />time, and with the current tensions, I believe<br />the tariff will remain. Also, there are no policy<br />changes that indicate this will be reversed before<br />March 1.","Mabry Cartwright (85%): I am placing the<br />probability at 85% because President Trump<br />recently signed an executive order, going into<br />effect Tuesday, to increase the tariff to 25%.<br />He has stood firm in the decision stating that<br />there might be some pain but the overall benefit<br />is greater. These tariffs were also signed into<br />effect to solve a \"national emergency\", so I<br />believe they will stay in place for at least a<br />month. Overall, 25 days in place is not very long,<br />so a change in the tariff below 10% before March<br />1st is very slim.","Margaret Pope (94%): President Trump imposed<br />a tariff of 25% on all goods from Canada with<br />an exception of energy resources which will be<br />tariffed at 10%. These tariffs go into effect<br />on February 4, 2025. On February 1, 2025, Canada<br />announced retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion<br />of US goods, with about $20.3 billion going into<br />effect on the 4th. The Trump administration shows<br />no signs of stopping or lowering these tariffs<br />in the near future, so it is more likely than not<br />that a tariff of greater than 10% will still be<br />implemented on most Canadian goods on March 1.","Maston Corn (70%): President Trump imposed 25%<br />tariffs on Canada that will be effective on<br />February 4th. In response to this, Prime Minister<br />Trudeau imposed a 25% tariff on 155 billion<br />dollars' worth of goods from the United States.<br />This effectively started a trade war between<br />the United States and Canada with both sides<br />not willing to give into the other. It is likely<br />that this trade war will last for a long time<br />depending on the willingness from both sides to<br />negotiate and come to a resolution. Both countries<br />are preparing for an extended period of tariffs<br />especially with past tariffs that the United<br />States has placed on Canada such as the steel and<br />aluminum tariffs in 2018 that lasted for more than<br />one year.","Mia Pisani (84%): During President Trump's first<br />term, he imposed tariffs on several countries,<br />including Canada and Mexico in June of 2018.<br />These tariffs were lifted May 20th, 2019, nearly<br />a year later. Yesterday President Trump signed an<br />executive order placing a 25% tariff on Canada,<br />Mexico, and China. He claims he did so to \"protect<br />Americans\" in a post on Instagram. He has received<br />backlash for the tariffs, as many people predict<br />his action will lead to further inflation. They<br />are set to begin on Tuesday. Considering how<br />long the tariffs lasted during his previous<br />presidency, I believe they will last at least<br />through March 1st. However, due to the immense<br />amount of backlash he is facing, there is a chance<br />he may end the tariffs when they inevitably raise<br />American prices.","Milan Yadav (70%): As of Feb. 1, POTUS has just<br />placed new tariffs on both Mexico and Canada, both<br />being at 25%. This was done via an executive order<br />and will take into effect in a few days on Feb.<br />4th. Before this happened, however, the chance of<br />the tariff rate of being 10% or higher on Canada<br />was already high. Trump stated he would be doing<br />this months ago - on Nov. 25, 2024, following his<br />election victory, he announced plans to implement<br />a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico,<br />and an additional 10% tariff on imports from<br />China.","Nathaniel Long (95%): As of Febuary 1st, President<br />Trump placed a tariff on all Canadian and Mexican<br />imported goods to combat illegal immigration<br />and the flow of fentanyl into the country.<br />(whitehouse.gov) Trump stated that these tariffs<br />will remain in place until \"the (immigration and<br />drug) crisis is averted. Specifically considering<br />how long immigration has been a problem in the<br />United States, it is unlikely Canada will be able<br />to shrink its rate of immigration into the US for<br />years to come, much less before March 1st.","Pablo Martinez (50%): Trump is already in plans<br />of putting an additional 25% tariffs on Canada so<br />it seems the odds are likely that the tarrif rate<br />might go up. However there might be some other<br />additional factors that might come into plan.<br />Possible negotiations between cannada and the<br />US might see this not happening but with all the<br />unpredictable things trump has done only one month<br />into his presidency, anything can happen.","Rebecca Mcadam (85%): Trump has already imposed<br />very high tariffs of more than 10 percent on<br />Canadian exports. This is a new record since<br />the 1940s and Trump has made it clear that his<br />intentions are to impose hefty tariffs. Canada has<br />retaliated at this points which makes me believe<br />this situation will escalate into a trade war of<br />sorts.","Riley Batz (80%): Just this past weekend,<br />President Trump announced a 25% additional tariff<br />on imports from Canada. According to him, it will<br />remain in effect until \"such time as Drugs, in<br />particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop<br />this Invasion of our Country!”. Further tariff<br />increases by the United States are possible over<br />the next few weeks. The orders state that the<br />Trump may raise the tariffs further if Canada<br />retaliates. Canada has already retaliated with<br />its own 25% tariff rate on American goods, so<br />it does not seem like this tariff war is set to<br />end anytime soon, especially before March 1st.<br />Additionally, Trump placed a tariff on Canada<br />during his first term, beginning in June 2018 and<br />remaining in place until May 2019. Now that the<br />tariffs are actually ordered, it is unlikely they<br />will be lifted in such short amount of time.","Ruby Douglas (50%): My gut tells me that there<br />is a 50/50 chance of what could happen with this<br />tariff. Considering the fact that this would hurt<br />our free trade with Canada and have a huge hit<br />on US consumers, I could see there being a tariff<br />that is below 10% because of the pressure put on<br />Trump. However, seeing that Trump could easily<br />place a high tariff on Canadian exports and he is<br />seemingly not wanting to back down, I could also<br />see a tariff above 10%. He has long pushed tariffs<br />and he is coming into office extremely eager,<br />therefore I think there is an equal chance of a<br />10% or higher tariff being imposed or not imposed.","Sarah Joyce (65%): Donald Trump has implemented<br />a 25% tariff on Canada, which has caused Canada<br />to announce their plans to implement retaliatory<br />tariffs. Economists expect that this will<br />negatively impact American consumers but also have<br />a much more negative impact on Canada’s economy.<br />Although Trump and Trudeau plan to meet today,<br />it does not seem that Trump has any interest in<br />backing down right now, and the United States can<br />sustain this pressure longer than Canada it seems.","Senait Pirani (75%): Canada has already<br />administered retaliatory tariffs, creating a<br />trade war that neither side will want to back<br />down from. Public pressure due to rising costs<br />may cause Trump to decrease tariffs to below 10%,<br />but I don't think that would come about in one<br />month. It is possible that a renegotiation of<br />USMCA would resolve in Trump decreasing tariffs,<br />but that would also take longer than one month to<br />actualize.","Sreya Pandyaram (72%): While right now there<br />is a 25% tariff rate on Canadian imports, the<br />probability of that going down is not specific<br />since this has caused Canada to retaliate. Trump's<br />action also threatens the USMCA and could cause<br />any trade agreement against the countries to<br />falter which would cause a massive uptake on<br />tariffs for exports. While some research says<br />that this is a negation tactic it Is difficult<br />to say that there will be a decrease from Trump.<br />While Trump does not want to threaten the USMCA<br />as according to Politico, it is complex. But the<br />article states that he wants to make a better deal<br />for USMCA, which could lessen tensions.","Thomas Smith (60%): Cost of living for countless<br />Americans will continue to rise if the tariffs<br />are still in their current form by March 1st. I<br />wouldn’t think the new administration would want<br />to do something this unpopular this early. Also<br />Canadian energy imports to the U.S. already have<br />a lower rate of 10% and I think the rest of the<br />goods have a chance at lowering as well.","Townsend Turner (85%): The question here is will<br />the tariffs that Trump has just imposed be lowered<br />in only slightly over a month’s time. I’d say<br />probably not based on Trump’s extensive pledge<br />to use tariffs and therefore his macho feeling of<br />implicit justification from the election as well<br />as his pledge to actually raise them if Canada<br />retaliates, which it has pledged to do already.<br />Furthermore, the primary reason that his executive<br />order gave for these tariffs are to stop flow of<br />illicit drugs, an issue that Canada cannot solve<br />to Trump’s satisfaction in so short a time.","Tristan Thompson (68%): President Trump has<br />enacted his plan of imposing tariffs on other<br />countries, including a 25 percent tariff on<br />Canada. This was one of Trump’s larger speaking<br />points during his campaign, and as Canada responds<br />with tariffs of their own, I believe it will be<br />much longer than a few months for the tariffs to<br />go below 10 percent.","Wyatt Dasher (75%): Using group think through<br />Polymarket as well as the election and other facts<br />proved in my brief, I would say that it is more<br />likely that the tariffs are still in place than<br />not in place by March 1st. The tariffs are to<br />affect the election and to show that rump keeps<br />his word.","Wyatt Stevenson (95%): As of February 1st, Trump<br />signed the orders that Tariffs will be in effect<br />to all imported goods from Canada. To be exact,<br />it is going up to 25%. Goods such as electricity,<br />oil, gas will be assigned to a higher tariff rate.<br />With it being in effect today, there is a low<br />chance that the bill will be overturned.","James Martin (99%): I believe there is a 99%<br />probability that the tariff rate on Canadian<br />exports to the US be higher than 10% on March<br />1. On February 1st President Trump signed a<br />25% tariff on all imports from Canada but a 10%<br />tariff on Canadian energy (oil, natural gas, and<br />electricity.

Diaz (90%): Given that as of December<br />2024 the inflation rate was 2.9% I believe that<br />it is highly likely that it will be higher than<br />3% once the consumer price index is released<br />this semester. President Trump's current tariff<br />proposals could also severely affect inflation<br />trends and lead to an upward spike on consumer<br />prices. Economists have stressed and made note<br />that these tariffs could impact the growth of the<br />United States and increase the inflation rate.<br />With all this said, the inflation rate might very<br />well be higher than 3% even though the current<br />target being aimed for is only 2%.","Addisen Kameron (20%): I think there’s a 20%<br />chance Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce get engaged<br />before April 28th. To be honest, I just don’t see<br />this happening. They got together in the summer<br />of 2023, a couple months after Taylor got out of<br />a 6 year relationship with Joe Alwyn. They haven't<br />been together that long and she was off on her<br />Eras Tour for almost the entire time. Relying on<br />my best friend and resident Taylor Swift expert,<br />I don’t think she would jump into marriage this<br />quickly nor want a flashy Super Bowl proposal.","Addisen Kameron (65%): Reading about this hurt<br />my head but I think there’s a 65% chance the US<br />inflation rate will be greater than 3% in any<br />CPI report this semester. Every forecaster I see<br />has been wrong for the last decade so they don’t<br />strike me as super reliable across the board. BUT<br />the world is in such chaos right now and Trump<br />just put tariffs on China, so I feel like it’ll go<br />up. I also asked my best friends’ business major<br />dad and he was very confident initially and then<br />very hesitant so I’m not sure.","Andreas Papandreou (43%): For such a public<br />couple, I find it very likely that any engagement<br />will be a highly private event. Even in a Super<br />Bowl win I do not believe that Travis will<br />get engaged to Taylor. However, with the NFL<br />season concluding this weekend and Taylor Swift<br />concluding her tour last December, both of the<br />stars are going to have an abundant amount of free<br />time. For these reasons I have put the probability<br />at 43%.","Andreas Papandreou (80%): The major challenge<br />in predicting whether the inflation rate will be<br />above 3% in any CPI this year, revolves around<br />the challenge of predicting President Trump.<br />While 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were<br />core campaign promises built on \"unfair trade\",<br />Trump reneged upon those policy stances with<br />minor concessions from both nations. With the<br />unpredictability of Trump, its hard to determine<br />whether his administration will or will not focus<br />on its tariff promises. Ultimately, I do think the<br />tariffs will be in place, and therefore inflation<br />will likely be above 3% on one of the CPI reports<br />this year.","Andy Wyatt (20%): I’m more inclined to trust<br />long-term trends on this question because tabloids<br />and fan accounts dominate the conversation on<br />Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce engagement rumors.<br />Despite several relationships (and a few that have<br />lasted longer than the current one), Swift has<br />never been engaged. This is a big move, and Swift<br />is a pretty calculating and cautious individual,<br />especially by celebrity standards.","Andy Wyatt (50%): We likely will not hit 3.1% for<br />January, so February and March will be the months<br />to watch. During that time frame, inflation hinges<br />on tariffs. With the delay of tariffs on Canada<br />and Mexico, the tariffs on Chinese goods currently<br />have the greatest potential impact on inflation.<br />A wildcare in this question is when Trump places<br />a tariff on the EU. Unless delayed or withdrawn,<br />the China tariff will take effect on February 10.<br />Between then and the end of March, if they are<br />still intact, prices could rise enough to register<br />on the CPI reports. However, at the same time,<br />inflation is still declining from its peak in the<br />summer of 2022. So, the general downward pressure<br />on inflation may counteract the effect of tariffs.<br />With all the uncertainty in this question, I<br />am not confident in indicating one direction or<br />another. It’s really a tossup.","Angela Jacobs (31%): Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift<br />have been in a relationship for nearly two years.<br />Recent speculation suggests that Kelce might<br />propose to Swift during or after the upcoming<br />Super Bowl. When asked about these rumors, Kelce<br />responded, \"Wouldn't you like to know,\" neither<br />confirming nor denying. According to BetKansas,<br />the odds of Kelce proposing to Swift by June 2025<br />are +200, implying a 33.3% chance. Bookies.com<br />offers odds of +150 for an engagement between<br />February 10 and April 30, 2025, suggesting a 40%<br />probability. However, because Taylor has recently<br />experienced a broken engagement I think she may<br />be more cautious about rushing into another one-<br />putting the odds under this 33%-40% range.","Angela Jacobs (78%): The inflation rate has<br />been gradually rising, from 2.4% in July 2024 to<br />2.9% in December 2024. This steady upward trend<br />suggests inflation is gaining momentum, especially<br />in the last quarter of 2024. The 25% tariffs on<br />Mexican and Canadian imports, plus 10% on Chinese<br />goods, are expected to directly impact consumer<br />prices. Historically, tariffs can add 0.5-1% to<br />CPI over a few months. Long-term expectations<br />have jumped to 3.3% which can accelerate price<br />increases as businesses adjust preemptively.<br />Also, inflation could be pushed above 3% faster<br />if energy costs spike with recent geopolitical<br />events and supply constraints. The inflation trend<br />is already upward, and with the new tariffs just<br />kicking in, the full effect hasn’t been felt yet.<br />We might see a spike in one of the reports between<br />now and April as prices adjust.","Anna Rachwalski (60%): If the NFL or publicists<br />have a say, or Taylor and Travis are truly as<br />in love as they appear, an engagement appears<br />impending. FanDuel Sportsbook projects an 11.76<br />percent chance that Kelce proposes to Swift after<br />the Super Bowl. Swift is notoriously tricky,<br />conspiratorial, and unknowable–it’s impossible to<br />know the state of her mind, music, or relationship<br />if she doesn’t want to share. But Kelce is willing<br />to share–and appears so in love with her that<br />a proposal is likely to be forthcoming, if not<br />before May, then in the next year.","Anna Rachwalski (60%): Inflation right now is<br />roughly 2.9%. The Federal Reserve predicts that<br />inflation will remain above its 2% target in<br />2025. Pretty much every economist is worried about<br />inflationary effects from Trump's actions, and<br />right now on Kalshi (one day before my predictions<br />due), it's predicted to be exactly three percent<br />as a result of yesterday's tariff scuffles. It's<br />going to be close, but I think yes.","Archita Gaur (48%): There were rumors flying<br />around that Travis Kelce will propose to Taylor<br />Swift during the Super Bowl; however, the New York<br />Post has given a 93.75% chance that Travis Kelce<br />does not propose. I do think there is a slight<br />chance that he will propose before April 28th but<br />they have only been dating for a year so I do not<br />think it is probable.","Archita Gaur (67%): Even though core CPI hit an<br />all time low since 2021, I still believe there<br />is a chance than CPI will be greater than 3%. I<br />researched around and found that the USDA has a<br />prediction that rices for all food are predicted<br />to increase 2.2 percent, with a prediction<br />interval of -0.4 to 4.9 percent. Additionally,<br />food-away-from-home prices are predicted to<br />increase 3.6 percent, with a prediction interval<br />of 2.0 to 5.1 percent. I think there is a chance<br />because of these numbers.","Ava Herring (70%): I believe that there is a good<br />chance that the inflation rate will be reported as<br />greater than 3% because the most recent CPI report<br />shows that it is already around 3%, and I do not<br />think that it will take much for it to rise. Even<br />if the inflation does end up going downward, the<br />monthly reports will show temporary trends, so I<br />believe that this could be a likely outcome.","Ayaan Fazal (10%): Because of Taylor Swift's<br />recent dating history, she has never been enganged<br />to any of 12 known ex-boyfriends. Due to their<br />relationship only be being 2 years old, for<br />Swift's standards, it is unlikely that they are<br />engaged. Additionally, a loss for the Chiefs would<br />severely decrease the odds. I am almost certain<br />that there will be no proposal in the coming<br />months.","Ayaan Fazal (35%): I believe that the inflation<br />rate will not increase over 3% this semester.<br />Last quarter, the inflation rate reached 2.9%,<br />just below 3. It should remain relatively low this<br />semester because of the govermental reorganization<br />under the Trump Administration.","Bailey Mattox (68%): I think they will likely get<br />engaged by April 28th, but I don't think they will<br />end up getting married. They seem like a perfect<br />couple and I think it would be a good set up for<br />Reputation (Taylor's Version) to be released. She<br />also has changed her style lately and might feel<br />like he's pushing her to be a different person<br />than she is.","Bailey Mattox (60%): We have already seen trump<br />say that there probably won't be a decrease in<br />the price of goods during his term and so far, the<br />inflation rate is really close to 3% so I think<br />its slightly more likely than not to happen, but<br />I'm only slightly more certain than a coin toss.","Benjamin Jacobstein (10%): Taylor Swift and Travis<br />Kelce are deeply focused on their careers, making<br />an engagement unlikely right now. Swift still has<br />rep tv and debut tv to release, and announcing<br />those along with a marriage in a short span<br />would probably be overwhelming for her and their<br />relationship. Kelce is also committed to his NFL<br />career, and with their packed schedules, they may<br />prefer to avoid added relationship pressure.","Benjamin Jacobstein (46%): While there has<br />been a recent rise in inflation metrics and the<br />implementation of hefty tariffs it is reasonable<br />to think that the U.S. CPI inflation rate could<br />exceed 3% in one or more reports by April 28,<br />2025, and while there are arguments on both sides,<br />most sources point to an upward trajectory in the<br />near future. But we will have to wait and see to<br />get a better forecast on whether inflation will<br />rise above 3% keeping a close watch of economic<br />indicators, policy developments, and global<br />events, but as of now I truly believe it is a<br />close call, so I would say a not so solid 46%.","Bennie Trujillano (45%): Even if Travis Kelce and<br />Taylor Swift get engaged, I doubt the public would<br />know about it until months after. It might've<br />already happened, but I doubt it would be revealed<br />by April 28th. But my largest deciding factor<br />here is that I believe Taylor Swift doesn't want a<br />marriage in the first place.","Bennie Trujillano (75%): Considering how tariffs<br />typically increase inflation, I can absolutely<br />see inflation rising. Whether it will reach 3%<br />in a cpi report or not is tricky, but considering<br />the current tariffs and rates the United States<br />currently has in place and is developing, I'd say<br />it's still likely to reach that number.","Brooke Cheney (25%): Taylor Swift has never<br />been engaged before, and I predict that even if<br />she was, she would keep it secret. Travis and<br />Taylor are going strong, and I do think they will<br />ultimately get engaged. However, I don't think it<br />will happen until later in the year.","Brooke Cheney (27%): Many financial institutions<br />have predicted that inflation will decrease from<br />its current level of 2.9% to around 2% by the end<br />of 2025. In addition, in the Fed's most recent<br />meeting, they decided to hold rates where they<br />are. In general, the Fed increases rates to combat<br />inflation. They have not increased rates in a<br />while and have been actually steadily decreasing<br />them showing lesser concern about inflation. The<br />biggest variable that would make my prediction<br />incorrect is tariffs. Trump said he was going to<br />increase tariffs over the weekend, but then stated<br />on Monday he would pause them for 30 days. Even<br />if tariffs do go in place though, I predict the<br />increase in inflation caused by tariffs will be<br />offset by overall inflation rates going down.","Chinelo Ireh (30%): Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce<br />will not be engaged by April 28 because Taylor<br />Swift does not have the best luck when it comes<br />to her love life. Her public love life over the<br />past 15 years demonstrated that she does not<br />stay in relationships for very long. With the<br />exception of Joe Alwyn, with whom she shared a<br />6 year relationship, all of her relationships<br />lasted less than 18 months. Many of these lasted<br />less than 6 months each. Furthermore, she has<br />not publicly announced an engagement with any<br />of her partners. While this is one of Swift's<br />longest relationships, Kelce is not one of her<br />typical partners. In the past, her partners have<br />been fellow creatives. Swift is also not Kelce's<br />type either. He has dated media personalities and<br />sportscasters who are a bit lower profile than<br />Swift. The pair has only been together for less<br />than 2 years so an engagement before April 28<br />would be rather soon.","Chinelo Ireh (80%): There are 16 categories in<br />the Consumer Price Index, all of which have varied<br />greatly over the past 12 months. Items such as<br />medical care services, electricity, and shelter<br />were above 3%. The CPI for all categories was<br />2.9% in December 2024. Because it is so close to<br />3%, it is not totally unlikely that it will go up<br />only 0.01% overall. I also think with the looming<br />tariffs on goods coming from Canada, Mexico, and<br />China will add to an increase in inflation because<br />it will increase the price of goods sold here.","Chloe Cooper (23%): With Travis and Taylor's<br />relationship only being about a year and a half<br />old, and the history of that latter individuals<br />relationship it seems unlikely that the famous<br />couple will be married anytime soon. With how<br />popular both individuals are there are many<br />speculations on when/if they are engaged, with<br />one popular one going around that Travis will<br />propose at the Super Bowl this coming Sunday.<br />After reading many articles speculating on the<br />couples relationship (being very skeptical of most<br />of them) it seems like the couple wants to wait<br />to spend more time together before thinking about<br />getting engaged. Its also interesting to note<br />that, after some digging, it seems as though the<br />average couple doesn't get engaged until they've<br />been dating for 2+ years. But who knows whats<br />going to happen, maybe the NFL script writers<br />want Travis to catch the game winning touchdown<br />and then open a ring box in the endzone as the<br />Chiefs win the Super Bowl (bad for two of my<br />predictions).","Chloe Cooper (99%): With the most recent inflation<br />rate report being at 2.9% and there being a trend<br />in increasing inflation rate over the past three<br />months, it seems very likely that the rate will<br />at least increase by .1% for the month of January.<br />A recent U.S. News article about inflation rates<br />in 2025 backs this claim up by saying how it can<br />be expected that through the trends of the past<br />few months, we can expect to see similar inflation<br />rates to what we have now. I do not think that the<br />inflation rate will go much higher than 3% or even<br />stay above the threshold for very long, but I do<br />believe that it should at least crack the 3% mark<br />for the month of January before seeing any kind of<br />decrease.","Christian Barr (30%): Due to the couple keeping<br />their relationship fairly private, I do not<br />believe they will engage before april 28th. I<br />believe we might not know until later this year<br />or next year, or until they are basically ready<br />for marriage, also they haven't even officially<br />came out and said they were dating, we all just<br />assumed. Due to Kelce's limited role in the chiefs<br />offense this year, It seems to me that he will<br />eventually be riding off into the sunset after a<br />successful 12 year career and will eventually take<br />on commentating or acting roles while being with<br />Swift to be one of Americas next golden boy.","Christian Barr (50%): Due to various political<br />forecasting models, Inflation is on a steady<br />decline that aims to be around 2.5%. although<br />Trumps tariffs on different countries have the<br />ability to inflate the numbers, it will most<br />likely not come this semester nor is it expected<br />to come anytime this year.","Da In Song (90%): if it's ANY CPI report over the<br />course of this semester, then yes, I do believe<br />we will hit 3% at some point this year once the<br />one-month delay on tariffs are lifted. In fact,<br />we may hit it this month, feeling the backlash of<br />China's tariffs and the negotiations to happen in<br />a month.","Da In Song (20%): There has been confusing media<br />coverage over this. Some say they will, some say<br />they won't. Some say Taylor's pregnant, some say<br />she's not. Considering her dating track record<br />and Polymarket's bet, I went for 20%. In fact,<br />considering her track record... she should be<br />broken up by April. Who knows?","Diane Johnson (25%): Taylor and Travis have only<br />been dating for a little under two years which is<br />longer than most of her relationships but still<br />a lot shorter than her longest with Joe Alwyn at<br />six years and they never even got engaged. Many<br />think Kelce will propose at the Superbowl but even<br />if the Chiefs win it would be unprofessional to<br />propose at this point and would distract from the<br />game. Even though the couple is getting older,<br />I think they are enjoying still getting to know<br />each other and will wait a little longer before<br />deciding to get engaged.","Diane Johnson (65%): The actions that the Trump<br />administration has taken thus far will make the<br />inflation rise past 3%. First with the strict ICE<br />checks that are occurring across the country that<br />are making immigrants scared to come to work.<br />Meaning labor will get more expensive just to meet<br />the current demand. Furthermore, the tariff wars<br />that Trump is waging on Canada, Mexico, and China<br />will also cause inflation, as our biggest trading<br />partners are also placing tariffs on American<br />goods. Means of production will get more expensive<br />as well as the goods themselves, leading to high<br />rates of inflation.","Eli Henderson (62%): The odds that Travis<br />gets down on one knee after the Super Bowl are<br />incredibly low on most betting sites, especially<br />with the contingency that the Chiefs would have to<br />win their third championship in three years. That<br />being said, even with a Chiefs loss, I still feel<br />as if the engagement will likely happen before<br />April 28. They'll have been dating for 2 years<br />come this September, and while a youngster like<br />myself finds it preposterous to pop the question<br />after so little time, celebrities aren't subject<br />to the same timeframe as someone like myself and<br />often get married with less time dating.","Elliana Williams (70%): Though their relationship<br />has been in the public eye since the beginning,<br />Travis and Taylor remain coy and private about<br />their engagement status. There have been rumors<br />circulating of engagement since they started being<br />public, and apparently a 'top Chief's executive'<br />has claimed to hear Taylor call herself Travis's<br />\"fiance\". It seems that they will eventualy get<br />married and though I dont think it will happen at<br />the super bowl, I do think they will get engaged<br />soon. The question is if we will know about it,<br />as they both have stated they wish to keep the<br />engagement private and only \"for Taylor\"- and the<br />people close to them know that too.","Elliana Williams (60%): The projected inflation<br />rate on the CPI for 2025 is between 2.4% and 2.9%.<br />However, there are too many factors to consider to<br />be sure of an outcome. The reason I have it as a<br />yes is because of the supply chain issues and food<br />shortages of eggs and some produce in stores, as<br />well as the introduction of Trump's new tariffs.","Emma Allen (30%): The two have only been dating<br />for a relatively short time and both have<br />extremely hectic careers. Swift’s dating past also<br />supports in more ways than one that it would be in<br />her character for an engagement to not be rushed.<br />Regardless if Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are<br />engaged or not by April 28th, I do not think this<br />will be public knowledge due to their tendency<br />to keep personal details private. This in itself<br />would also result in “no” answer to our forecast<br />question.","Emma Allen (70%): The annual inflation rate in<br />the US rose for a 3rd consecutive month to 2.9%<br />in December 2024 from 2.7% in November. Sources<br />show this is in line with market expectations.<br />Additionally, Trump's tariffs announcements, which<br />are still shifting, on Mexico, Canada and China<br />will cause American business and corporations to<br />brace for higher prices. For these two reasons, I<br />find it plausible that the inflation rate will be<br />greater than 3% in some month of this semester.","Emma Pastor (20%): Considering the fact that<br />Taylor Swift has been in at least 12 relationships<br />in her past 16 years in the public eye, without<br />any engagements so far, I predict that the<br />chances her and Travis Kelce get engaged before<br />April 28th are slim. This is also taking into<br />account the fact that Taylor dated her previous<br />partner, Joe Alwyn, for over 6 years, and remained<br />unengaged. She began dating Kelce in September of<br />2023, only 5 months after this breakup, and their<br />relationship has been extremely public for its<br />entire duration. This publicity may have put a<br />slight strain on their relationship potentially,<br />and Swift is known for her intense but not<br />necessarily proposal-worthy relationships. While<br />I think fans are hopeful for this engagement, I<br />truly do not envision Kelce and Swift succumbing<br />to the public pressure. Kelce telling reporters<br />\"wouldn't you like to know\" when asked if he plans<br />to pop the question feels to me like a sort of<br />marketing ploy for the two of them, meant to gain<br />more press during this time.","Emma Pastor (85%): Given the fact that President<br />Trump has recently signed many tariffs into<br />effect, which will in turn potentially raise<br />consumer prices on imports, I would expect the<br />inflation rates to increase from their current<br />level. The most recent CPI revealed that the<br />inflation rate was 2.9%, and the annual inflation<br />rate for 2024 as a whole was 3.2%, meaning the US<br />has already been hovering around this 3% mark.","Emma Peterson (10%): I genuinely believe there is<br />an extremely low probability of the two getting<br />engaged. My number one reasoning for this is<br />because Taylor has never been engaged, even during<br />her 6 year relationship with Joe Alwyn. Her and<br />Travis haven't been dating long enough in my<br />eyes to elicit an engagement. I also think with<br />the Super Bowl and all of the attention being on<br />football, they wouldn't want to divert any away<br />from that. I think the two of them have a chance<br />of getting engaged, but not within the time frame<br />of this class.","Emma Peterson (73%): For the inflation rate to be<br />higher than 3% in any of the CPIs this semester<br />I say 73% because the rate is already 2.9% as of<br />right now. I also think that with the way grocery<br />prices have risen in the past couple of weeks,<br />there is a high likelihood of the inflation rate<br />rising. The CPI reports also happen to be released<br />in the middle of the month which means theres 3<br />chances to have a CPI over 3%.","Ethan Joyce (12.5%): Considering the usual<br />duration of Taylor Swifts more recent<br />relationships on average, I would say there is a<br />fairly low likelihood that they will be getting<br />engaged prior to the end of the semester, even<br />though their relationship is very public in<br />nature. Especially considering that she and Joe<br />Alwyn were dating for so long and did not end up<br />married.","Ethan Joyce (72.5%): To assess the probability<br />that U.S. inflation will rise above 3% in at least<br />one Consumer Price Index (CPI) report before April<br />28, 2025, I employed a probabilistic approach<br />that accounts for potential tariff impositions and<br />their impact on inflation. This analysis follows a<br />structured methodology that begins with evaluating<br />the likelihood of tariffs being imposed by early<br />March on key trade partners—Canada, Mexico, China,<br />and the European Union (EU)-- and evaluates the<br />likelihood of combinations of tariffs on specific<br />trade partners following each individual nations<br />assessment. The second step involves estimating<br />the probability that these tariffs, if enacted,<br />will push inflation above the 3% threshold.<br />Using these probability estimates which I created<br />using the equivalent bet test and my exposure<br />to news media, I constructed a probability tree<br />and applied the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to<br />address overlapping scenarios.","Ethan Marcum (70%): Travis and Taylor alike are<br />well into their 30's and have been dating over a<br />year, almost two. They both are well into their<br />careers as well, so they have nothing to really<br />prove or need to build a life. If the chiefs win<br />I think Travis will most likely propose; however,<br />this was also predicted last year as well. 70%<br />could be a bit high, but they are both eccentric<br />and outgoing people. They would make some very<br />athletic babies as well, maybe they are in it to<br />produce D1 athletes. That's a joke, but I do feel<br />that it would sort of be a waste of time for them<br />to keep dating and waste father time's natural<br />clock. No more break up songs for tay tay.","Ethan Marcum (60%): In all honesty, I have no<br />clue. The inflation rate has loomed around 3%<br />since 2023. I feel that due to the fault on<br />tariffs with both Mexico and Canada, that it could<br />stoop below 3%; however, it is already 2.9% and I<br />am sure there will be many tariffs on China, and<br />some sort of tariff on Canadian energy. I think<br />it will be just at 3%, but I can see it being<br />just below as well. In the span of 4 days this<br />administration has changed its' mind on trade<br />issues quite easily so I feel it is too tough to<br />say.","Grace Mccann (30%): I think that they haven't been<br />dating long enough and especially with how much<br />they have both been in the public eye recently<br />they would want to wait and let their relationship<br />develop a little more before making such a big<br />commitment and sparking even more media attention.","Grace Mccann (40%): I think that even though there<br />has been many complaints about inflation in the<br />past year it is unlikely that inflation will rise<br />above 3 percent by the end of the semester. Recent<br />reports indicate a consistent downward trend in<br />inflation, with the core CPI also remaining below<br />3 percent.","Grace Reichelderfer (35%): Travis Kelce and Taylor<br />Swift are both very private people. It seems<br />unlikely to me that they will be publicly engaged<br />before April 28th. Even if they do get engaged<br />prior to April 28th, I find it unlikely that it<br />will be public knowledge before then. Because<br />they are both very public figures, I see them<br />announcing their engagement at a public event.<br />For example, if they showed up to the Met Gala<br />(which is on May 5th) and she was wearing a ring.<br />However, because the offseason is coming up for<br />Kelce, it seems likely that the couple could get<br />engaged before the fall.","Grace Reichelderfer (68%): According to many<br />forecasting companies, the US inflation rate is<br />expected to be between 2.4% and 2.9% throughout<br />2025. The first CPI report of the year will<br />be released on February 12th. This will give a<br />baseline for what the months following will look<br />like as well. We’ve seen the US inflation rate<br />decline over the past two years, and it seems as<br />if this trend will continue into 2025.","Hampton Barrineau (15%): As fun as this idea is,<br />it relies on a number of unlikely circumstances to<br />happen. While some in the NFL say that the Super<br />Bowl is scripted, most folks agree that the Eagles<br />have a higher chance of winning. Beyond that, many<br />celebrities will hide important news about the<br />relationship like engagements, so it seems even<br />more unlikely that they would want to do so so<br />publicly .","Hampton Barrineau (70%): From the perspective of<br />the consumer price index, 3% is very reasonable.<br />Especially considering tariffs and the potential<br />of price shocks, unfortunately it is very<br />believable to think that prices will continue to<br />rise and impact American consumers. Furthermore,<br />inflation itself is usually two percent.","Hannah Carson (20%): Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift<br />are both very busy people. Taylor Swift has just<br />finished her 2 year tour and Travis Kelce is about<br />to play in the Super Bowl this week. Because of<br />this, they haven't had a lot of time together<br />to grow their relationship. Additionally, Taylor<br />Swift's last relationship was 6 years without an<br />engagement and Travis Kelce's last relationship<br />was 5 years without an engagement. This is well<br />above the national average of 2.5 years before you<br />get engaged. Also, Kelce and Taylor have told news<br />outlets \"they are not rushing into it\" when asked<br />about engagement. All this leads me to be fairly<br />certain they will not be engaged by April 28th.","Hannah Carson (30%): I feel like this is an<br />unpopular opinion, but I believe the US inflation<br />rate will not be greater than 3% in any CPI report<br />this semester. I looked at multiple US investment<br />sites and they all predicted that US inflation<br />rate will go down this year. The government is<br />striving for a 2% CPI report by the end of the<br />year. This is possible, but still unlikely. The<br />only month I am unsure whether the inflation<br />rate will be greater than 3% is February. But,<br />with trade deals already being made with Mexica<br />and Canada to potentially drop the tariffs, I<br />don't think the impact on inflation will be as<br />big as some mainstream news outlets are claiming.<br />Additionally, I believe negotiation and deals are<br />going to be made with China in the next week or 2<br />to get rid of tariffs. A trade war isn't going to<br />be good for either one of our economies and I feel<br />like this will get fixed very quickly.","Isaac Fleischer (15%): Taylor Swift and Travis<br />Kelce have been dating for about 18 months.<br />According to a study by \"the knot,\" most Americans<br />date for at least two years before marriage.<br />Because of this, I do not think it is likely<br />that they will be engaged before the end of the<br />semester. Though there are rumors that Kelce<br />might propose should the chiefs win the super<br />bowl, Kelce has not been overtly public with his<br />relationship. Kelce has even criticized the NFL<br />for too much Swift coverage. These reasons make me<br />think that he will not propose to his girlfriend<br />of 18 months on national TV. There is still a<br />chance that he proposes in private between the<br />super bowl and the end of the semester, but the<br />time frame is relatively short.","Isaac Fleischer (70%): The inflation rate from<br />the last CPI report was 2.9%. This means that<br />any increase to the inflation rate will cause it<br />to exceed 3%. Due to Trump's recent enactment of<br />trade tariffs against Canada, China, and Mexico,<br />prices are likely to rise for the American<br />consumer. Tariffs typically cause business to<br />pass on their increasing cost of production to the<br />consumer, contributing to inflation and causing<br />prices to rise. That being said, the time frame of<br />the semester may be too short for the consequences<br />of Trump's policies to take effect. With all<br />things considered I believe there is a 70% chance<br />that the inflation rate will be greater than 3% in<br />any CPI report during the semester.","Isabella Molina (30%): There aren’t many reports<br />about Travis and Taylor’s relationship. It’s clear<br />they are still together, but there haven’t been<br />major reports speculating about an engagement.<br />I also put the probability low due to Taylor<br />Swift’s dating history, as she has had on-and-off<br />relationships in the past. However, I can see why<br />an engagement could happen soon, given their age.<br />Still, their busy schedules might be a reason why<br />neither is ready for that level of commitment. I<br />think April is too soon, but maybe later in the<br />year.","Isabella Molina (40%): Current forecasts suggest<br />the U.S. inflation rate will remain below 3%<br />this semester. But due to new tariffs proposed by<br />Donald Trump, which could increase inflation by<br />0.5%–1%. If implemented (which seems likely) these<br />tariffs might increase inflation above 3%, but it<br />is unclear when we would see the numbers change<br />if these tariffs are imposed. Because of this, I<br />estimate a 40% probability that at least one CPI<br />report this semester will show inflation exceeding<br />3%.","Jacob Weiss (50%): Most couples date for at<br />least two years before getting married. The April<br />28th deadline is under the two year mark. This<br />is a celebrity relationship though which means<br />they will have grandiose attempts to be engaged.<br />Winning the Superbowl definitely would be one of<br />the places to do it.","Jacob Weiss (90%): In December we where at<br />a 2.9 cpi rate. With recent trade tariffs it<br />is highly likely that the price of goods will<br />increase. Companies will pass on the extra tax<br />price to consumers causing the price of goods to<br />increase. Further more the alternative US goods<br />will should be of a cheaper price may not be as<br />they are likely to raise their price in line with<br />competition to make more profit.","Jake Garrard (59%): At the time, the U.S.<br />inflation rate sits at around 2.9% currently,<br />which is a .4% increase in December. While there<br />were tariffs imposed on some of the U.S.' biggest<br />trade partners by the President, Mexico and Canada<br />have already agreed to a month long pause on<br />these tariffs to workout a solution with President<br />Trump. These tariffs have the potential to raise<br />the inflation rate, but if they are worked out<br />quickly, this effect will not be very impactful.<br />However, I still predict that inflations rates<br />will reach 3% throughout this semester.","Jenny Qiu (50%): On one hand, Taylor Swift has<br />a lot of dating experience so she would most<br />likely not rush marriage. Marriage would also<br />imply settling down and maybe starting a family,<br />but they are very busy people so they may wait<br />til they're ready to step away from their careers<br />a little to be married. On the other hand, they<br />are both in their 30s and people generally date<br />for a shorter time before getting married. This<br />relationship is also viewed to be more serious<br />than Taylor's previous ones. There is great<br />speculation that Kelce will propose at the Super<br />Bowl, however, they may be more private and be<br />engaged without public knowledge.","Jenny Qiu (70%): The Consumer Price Index released<br />on January 15 for the month of December stated<br />the inflation rate as 2.9%. With the tariffs that<br />President Trump imposed on Canadian and Chinese<br />imports (plus Mexican but it they're put on hold<br />for a month), prices of goods are highly expected<br />to go up. Before these tariffs were announced,<br />some forecasters predicted the inflation rates<br />for 2025 to be between 2.4 to 2.9%, which was<br />already quite high. Now, with them in mind, the<br />predictions are really likely to be higher, and<br />will include 3.0% in them.","Jerusalem Greenberg (50%): I know, seriously,<br />absolutely nothing about this couple. I have<br />never followed Taylor Swift. I do not care<br />about football. I have no idea if this is<br />something people have been speculating about.<br />All the research I've done suggests that there<br />is absolutely no evidence behind \"Guys, they're<br />dating!\" that suggests he's going to propose. He<br />didn't do it last year. People were just as hype<br />about that being a possibility last year. I just<br />don't know. I'd leave it up to chance.","Jerusalem Greenberg (60%): The U.S. has had<br />horrible inflation for the past few years, and if<br />these tariffs are anything to say about it, it's<br />only going to go up. Right now, the inflation rate<br />is 2.9 on an upward spike, so it's very likely it<br />will go up another .1% at some point during the<br />semester. I've already noticed in my personal life<br />that groceries have spiked in price in regular<br />grocery stores.","Jessy Lee (25%): I don't believe Kelce will<br />propose that soon. The timing feels too soon for<br />both of them, considering their busy careers and<br />how little time they've been together publicly.<br />Both Kelce and Swift also tend to take their<br />time with relationships, especially given their<br />fame and the constant media attention. Getting<br />engaged is a big decision, and it’s more likely<br />they will continue to let their relationship grow<br />naturally, instead of rushing into something like<br />an engagement.","Jessy Lee (70%): There are many factors currently<br />contributing to possibilities of inflation within<br />the next few months. Trumps imposition of tariffs<br />on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China can cause<br />major inflation by up to 1.3 percentage points.<br />There will most likely be retaliation from these<br />countries which will still cause inflation, maybe<br />just not as much. Trump also has discussed tariffs<br />from the U.K and Europe while they stand that they<br />import from the U.S and the U.S. barely exports<br />from those countries. Another factor that could<br />play part into rises in inflation could be the<br />mass deportation. While this causes job shortages,<br />many believe it will even out with the loss of<br />consumers as well.","Joey Khashan (35%): Taylor Swift has had many<br />relationships and produced many songs about<br />her relationships, yet she has not been engaged<br />before. Travis Kelce has also never been engaged<br />but has been in a long-term relationship before<br />which leads me to believe that he would not want<br />to rush into marriage after only a year and a<br />half. Many have speculated that he will ask her if<br />the Chiefs win the Super Bowl, but I believe that<br />it is more likely that there will be more of a<br />focus on his football career and he will retire if<br />they win the Super Bowl.","Joey Khashan (60%): There will be 3 CPI reports<br />reporting on the US inflation rate during our<br />semester, and I believe that one of them has a<br />chance at reporting over a 3% inflation rate.<br />The instigatory tariffs that President Trump has<br />been implementing will likely cause a tariff war<br />with one other major trade partner if the current<br />hostility continues. The rates were however<br />falling (excluding December) before Trump was in<br />office, so I am not very confident that it will<br />hit that 3% mark.","Joshua Kang (50%): This would be a very private<br />decision between the couple - it seems that the<br />couple is set in keeping it that way. There has<br />not been much information reported by the two or<br />other sources. Certainly it will not be at the<br />Super Bowl or likely before then - Kelce likely<br />wants to keep as much distractions out of his head<br />before the game, and a source indicated that they<br />want it to be a private affair, out of the public<br />eye. The source also stated they are not in a<br />great hurry to take the next step - however that<br />is greatly subjective, and for Kelce and Swift,<br />that a \"not great hurry\" may well be before April<br />28.","Joshua Kang (48%): Currently, the CPI is at 2.9%.<br />Although it may seem like cause for concern, it<br />seems that most experts are confident that there<br />will not be a strong push of accelerated inflation<br />- Wall Street is still doing relatively well,<br />a positive correlator with relatively stable<br />inflation rates. December's actual CPI rise was<br />lower than projected by the Federal Reserve, which<br />is a positive sign. However, very recent economic<br />developments like the trade war initiated by the<br />Trump administration may push inflation rates.","Julia Loggins (35%): I do not believe a Taylor<br />Swift and Travis Kelce engagement is going to<br />happen before April 28. In regards to the upcoming<br />Super Bowl, there are a lot of factors in place<br />such as a Chiefs win. After looking at multiple<br />betting sites, the money seems to follow the<br />fact that the odds that the two leave engaged<br />this Sunday is slim. In addition, the pair has<br />only been dating for around 2 years with both of<br />their longest relationships doubling that. In my<br />opinion, the two will wait longer, possibly till<br />Travis Kelce retires, until popping the question.","Julia Loggins (32%): According to multiple<br />sources, it is unlikely for the inflation rate<br />to go above 3%. In addition, when looking at<br />the current trend, it is not very likely for the<br />inflation rate to reach 3%. Models such as Trading<br />Economics anticipate the inflation rate to stay<br />between 2.4% and 2.9% between the end of 2024 and<br />beginning of 2026.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (27%): Given Taylor Swift's<br />previous long term relationship with Joe Alwyn<br />spanning nearly 7 years with no engagement or<br />marriage, I don't believe she will be publicly<br />engaged to Travis Kelce before May. Unless<br />something really bad about her were to come to<br />light, like Blake Lively/Justin Baldoni situation<br />level bad, I don't think it will happen and would<br />only occur if she needed to divert attention from<br />such catastrophe. Even then, I think it would be<br />highly unlikely for something so damaging to come<br />to light about her because of her insane PR team<br />that can essentially paint the public’s perception<br />of her however they please.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (65%): Given Donald Trump's<br />recent tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada,<br />some of the US's most crucial trading partners,<br />I believe it is highly likely that inflation will<br />rise in the coming months. While the tariffs on<br />imports from Mexico and Canada have been paused<br />for thirty days, if they are to resume, in<br />combination with the retaliatory tariffs set by<br />the US's neighboring nations, it is likely that<br />inflation rates will rise above 3%. The inflation<br />rate, as determined by the CPI currently stands<br />at 2.9%, and it is very difficult to gauge whether<br />this will exceed 3% by the end of the semester.<br />For that reason, I believe the probability of the<br />US inflation rate exceeding 3% is 65% likely.","Kelsey Dyar (80%): The couple have been together<br />since September 2023 and seem to be very serious<br />in their relationship. MGM bets have 85% of bets<br />saying Travis will propose at the Super Bowl,<br />but 95% of the money is on no. I do believe he<br />will propose even if it is not at the Super Bowl.<br />Taylor recently finished her massive Eras tour<br />and Kelce is about to finish up football season. I<br />think the timing is right for them to get engaged<br />soon and there have been rumors that they already<br />are. I think it is more likely than not that they<br />will be engaged by April 28th.","Kelsey Dyar (40%): Looking at PolyMarket, it<br />seems that most people on the site do not think<br />inflation will go above 3%. The tariffs Trump<br />imposed on Canada most likely would have raised<br />inflation but now that there has been an agreement<br />between Trudeau and Trump, I do not believe that<br />will be a factor. It seems like Trump's use of<br />tariffs is simply to look powerful and get what he<br />wants from foreign leaders, so I don’t expect to<br />see many consequences from them. Because Trump is<br />so unpredictable I am predicting a number closer<br />to 50 but I do not think inflation will be greater<br />than 3% at any point in the semester.","Kyle Smith (22%): I am not very up to date on the<br />relationship between the two but with April only<br />being a few months away the chances are dwindling.<br />If it does happen I see the plausibility being<br />the highest around the offseason due to wanting<br />to stay relevant year round. They have been in<br />a relationship for about a year and a half and<br />although there are many articles covering the<br />topic, they do not provide the insight we would<br />truly need to know the possibility level.","Kyle Smith (55%): With evolving political<br />actions taken on by a new administration there<br />is possibility of the rate being both higher and<br />lower than 3%. The proposed tariffs would likely<br />increase the prices of many consumer goods. With<br />the current CPI rate being around 2.9% we are<br />already pretty close to this benchmark. I do see<br />the percent to reach over 3% but it will most<br />likely be corrected with further developments<br />by the administration. Thus, there is still a<br />possibility of it reaching another .1% before<br />possibly rebounding.","Lawton Smith (25%): I honesty have zero clue about<br />this topic. I have tried to separate myself from<br />this topic as much as possible over the past two<br />years. But from what I do know and researched , I<br />find it extremely difficult to believe that Travis<br />and Taylor get engaged. For one, if Taylor gets<br />engaged it will probably ruin her next album. And<br />for Travis , he is one of the most insufferable<br />hot heads in the league. But that being said , I<br />will not be surprised that if the chiefs magically<br />win Sunday , that Travis would get on one knee.","Lawton Smith (31%): As of December 2024, the U.S.<br />inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price<br />Index, was 2.9%. Forecasts for the first half<br />of 2025 suggest that inflation may remain around<br />this level, with some projections indicating rates<br />between 2.6% and 2.9%. However , there is a chance<br />that it rises over 3 with the recent threat of<br />implemented tariffs , but with other countries<br />bending to US already , there might not be a high<br />likelihood of it.","Levi Thomas (30%): After consulting betting<br />markets and discussing the matter with my Swiftie<br />roommate, I have concluded that Taylor Swift and<br />Travis Kelce are unlikely to be engaged. Though<br />it is impossible to know the thoughts and private<br />lives of these two individuals, Swift has been<br />in multiple relationships before this one that<br />have lasted significantly longer but failed to<br />result in an engagement. Though this is not a<br />sole predictor for whether or not the two could<br />get together, I feel that both parties are both<br />massive media personalities who have only been<br />publicly seeing each other for a relatively short<br />time. They may very well be engaged one day but I<br />am not confident that they would do so within our<br />timeframe.","Levi Thomas (80%): The CPI report for December of<br />2024 had U.S. inflation at 2.9%. The fact that the<br />inflation rate is already so close to 3%, and the<br />recent economic backlash that has been observed<br />due to Trump’s tariff strategy will likely lead<br />to an inflation rate higher than 3% in the coming<br />months. Furthermore, even if the threat of tariffs<br />does not result in an inflation rate larger<br />than 3%, any of the tariffs Trump has suggested<br />actually going into effect would likely increase<br />inflation beyond 3%.","Lillie Puhrmann (28%): While I believe Travis<br />and Taylor have a good relationship, I think the<br />probability for them to get engaged by April 28th<br />is very low. They do have a strong and committed<br />relationship that is shown publicly, but they<br />have been dating for a little over a year. Both of<br />their careers require them to be very busy and it<br />just does not seem possible at the moment.","Lillie Puhrmann (63%): The chance that U.S.<br />inflation will go over 3% in a CPI report this<br />semester is fairly high. As of December 2024,<br />inflation stood at 2.9%, and predictions suggest<br />it will stay around this level. But, economic<br />uncertainty, like possible tariff policies, supply<br />chain problems, or changes in energy prices, might<br />cause inflation to rise temporarily. Considering<br />how unpredictable inflation has been lately, it's<br />possible that at least one CPI report could exceed<br />3%, but it's not an absolute certainty. If the<br />economy stabilizes, inflation might remain under<br />3%, but any unforeseen events could push it past<br />that point.","Mabry Cartwright (30%): I do not believe<br />that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce will be<br />engaged/announce an engagement by April 28th. The<br />couple have only been dating since September of<br />2023 and seem to be taking the relationship slow.<br />They are also very private, so I do not believe<br />they would immediately announce an engagement<br />to the public. The only reason I placed the<br />probability at 30% is because of speculation from<br />many sources that Kelce may retire this season.<br />With him retiring and Swift being done with her<br />eras tour, there is a possibility that they may<br />move their relationship forward.","Mabry Cartwright (20%): I placed the probability<br />that the US inflation rate will be greater than<br />3% this semester relatively low because most<br />projections from the Congressional Budget Office<br />have it sitting below 2.9%. There have also been<br />no rate cuts. The issue of impending tariffs does<br />bring more questions about the inflation rate, but<br />the CPI report has a very lagged effect in regard<br />to tariffs, so I do not see an impact from these<br />before the end of the semester.","Margaret Pope (37%): Although Taylor Swift<br />and Travis Kelce are two of the largest public<br />figures right now, they are relatively private<br />in comparison to their status. Taylor Swift never<br />openly speaks about her relationships, with the<br />exception of her tour and her speech at the 2024<br />grammy's, fans are left to speculate based on what<br />they see her doing. I believe it is not likely<br />that the public will know if Travis Kelce and<br />Taylor Swift are engaged by April 28.","Margaret Pope (58%): In the last 3 months, the<br />inflation rate has continued to slowly rise.<br />It currently sits at 2.9%, as published in<br />the December CPI report. I believe this steady<br />incline in the inflation rate should raise some<br />eyebrows. Considering the transition into the<br />Trump administration, it raises alarms that the<br />potential tariffs he is imposing could affect the<br />Federal Reserve's choice to keep interest rates<br />high. I believe that it is more likely than not<br />that a CPI report will be higher than 3% before<br />April 28.","Maston Corn (65%): With the Superbowl coming up<br />on February 9th, Travis Kelce has been asked many<br />questions about the future of his relationship<br />with Taylor Swift. In recent years, when asked<br />about if he would propose, he has simply dismissed<br />the question and moved onto the next. However,<br />when asked before the upcoming game, he responded<br />with \"Wouldn't you like to know?\", with a smile on<br />his face. If the Chiefs win the Superbowl I could<br />see that it is very likely that he proposes to<br />Taylor Swift at the end of the game. However, even<br />if they do not win, there is still plenty of time<br />in the off season for him to propose to her.","Maston Corn (70%): The U.S. inflation rate is<br />currently 2.9 percent and seem to continue to<br />rise as Trump's tariff policy continues to be<br />implemented. The annual inflation rate for 20204<br />was 3.2% and with the tariffs continuing to be<br />implemented consumer prices are likely to rise and<br />inflation is likely to increase in the short term.<br />The people of the United States are likely to feel<br />this inflation in the next month.","Matthew Newby (15%): I do not think it is likely<br />that Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift get engaged<br />before April 28th. They have been dating for a<br />year and a half and it seems famous people stay<br />dating for longer or never even get married. I<br />believe if they were to get engaged it would be<br />privately and probably not for some time.","Meera Srinivasan (25%): Given what little I<br />know about the nature of Travis Kelce and Taylor<br />Swift's relationship, I do not think it is<br />likely that the two will be engaged by the 28th<br />of April. In the context of their relationship,<br />it feels somewhat premature; thus, I believe it<br />is unlikely, but still possible. In my opinion,<br />however, the probability of the two becoming<br />engaged is also partially dependent on the victor<br />of the Superbowl, which is unknown as of now.<br />If Kelce's team, the Kansas City Chiefs, are to<br />become the first team to win a third consecutive<br />Superbowl, that may influence the odds of Kelce<br />proposing. If they were to lose, that could have<br />some influence as well.","Meera Srinivasan (35%): So far, the US inflation<br />rate has gradually decreased since the near-record<br />highs of June 2022, but continues to fall short<br />of the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.<br />Currently, prices on goods largely stayed stable<br />or declined in 2024, while prices for services and<br />housing remained elevated. Despite new variables<br />influencing economic uncertainty, such as the<br />Trump administration's rollout of aggressive<br />tariffs on US trade partners, I do not believe<br />that this will factor into the inflation rate<br />in the immediate future. If the tariffs do have<br />an impact, I expect it will be observed later in<br />2025, or at least after April 2025.","Mia Pisani (41%): I believe Kelce and Swift will<br />eventually get engaged, but I do not think it<br />will happen before April 28, 2025. The couple has<br />not been dating for an extended period of time,<br />much of which Kelce has been traveling with the<br />Chiefs and Swift has been dedicated to her Eras<br />Tour. Additionally, people have emphasized that<br />Kelce does not want an engagement spectacle.<br />This also leads me to believe that if they were<br />to get engaged before April 28th, it would not<br />be publicized for some time after. All of these<br />factors have led me to determine there is a 41%<br />chance Swift and Kelce are engaged, with the<br />public being aware, prior to April 28th.","Mia Pisani (72%): The inflation rate is about<br />2.9% today, and with the tariffs going into effect<br />I expect it to rise. However, much of President<br />Trump's campaign emphasized maintaining gas and<br />grocery prices. Many of his supporters are upset<br />with the tariffs, as they believe this will<br />negatively affect the United States economy. With<br />pushback from politicians and his constituents,<br />there is a chance Trump may end the tariffs.<br />The deal with Mexico and his tariff plans in<br />the past make it seem unlikely that he would<br />end them before the semester ends. Additionally,<br />the Fed is aiming to combat inflation by keeping<br />interest rates high, which leads me to predict a<br />probability of 72%.","Milan Yadav (25%): Kelce has said that he is<br />taking his relationship with Swift slowly and<br />has just been quoted saying that he has no plans<br />whatsoever to engage to her soon.However, anything<br />can happen when it comes to something like this,<br />as we have very little info on it all. Vegas<br />somehow can predict the future sometimes, as<br />bets are made with hundreds of millions on the<br />line for so many people. Vegas says that there is<br />almost a 95% chance no proposal will happen, but<br />the general public says otherwise. It's hard to<br />tell, really. But at the end of the day, Kelce and<br />Swift are still deep in their respective careers<br />of football and music so the timing would be a bit<br />off if they proposed now....","Milan Yadav (33%): Due to POTUS' sternness on<br />Mexico, Canada, Panama, and China in terms of<br />tariffs and trade equity, our inflation rate will<br />most likely decline from the 2.7-2.9% range it<br />was at in December/January. In the last 24 hours,<br />Trump has stated that he will pause any and all<br />tariffs on Mex/Can as both of those countries<br />have caved in and finally have begun to trade<br />equally, and have pledged more support at the<br />borders with the US. However, since this question<br />asks until late April, there is always a chance<br />of the inflation rate going up in the new few<br />months. When demand for goods increases, the IR<br />will go up (and vice versa). Trump is favorable<br />towards protectionist monetary policies which also<br />increases IR. However, since 2022, the IR has only<br />steadily decreased and most economists forecast<br />this will remain as is.","Nathaniel Long (40%): In many relationship cases,<br />partners do not get engaged until they have<br />been dating for two or more years, which Travis<br />Kelce and Taylor Swift have not reached yet. In<br />addition, with the upcoming Super Bowl and Kelce<br />playing for the Chiefs, it is unlikely that the<br />couple would announce their engagement and take<br />focus away from the outcome of the Super Bowl,<br />likely choosing a more appropriate time when<br />public attention will be highest, possibly during<br />the summer. This would also put them around the<br />2 year time of average dating time before couples<br />are engaged.","Nathaniel Long (75%): The average inflation rate<br />during 2024 was 2.9%, just barely pushing the<br />borders of our 3.0% margin. While Donald Trump has<br />promised to lower inflation, his current focuses<br />through his executive orders has been tariffs and<br />deportation of illegal immigrants. While tariffs<br />have little effect on the inflation rate, mass<br />deportation can cause prices to rise and cause<br />inflation. It is likely that, considering Trump's<br />current focuses, the inflation rate will rise in a<br />CPI report before he is able to begin his plans to<br />curb it.","Niomi Nurse (30%): Although Taylor and Travis have<br />been dating for a while, since the summer of 2023,<br />i think it is unlikely that they will get engaged.<br />Taylor Swift has recently finished her Era’s<br />World Tour and Travis has been preparing for the<br />super bowl.These are both very busy times in their<br />lives. Additionally, Travis did not join Taylor<br />Swift on the red carpet at the Grammy’s. They are<br />still in a confirmed relationship, but I do not<br />think they will make it to fiancé status.","Niomi Nurse (80%): I do believe that the inflation<br />rate will go above 3% this semester, because of<br />the introduction of international tariffs and<br />drastic changes being made to our economy. As<br />of December 2024 the inflation rate was at 2.9%,<br />which is extremely close to 3%. As of January<br />2025 the inflation rate was projected to go down<br />to 2.7%. Because of the drastic economic changes<br />being made and inflation on the rise, I can<br />foresee this figure increasing and fluctuating<br />throughout the semester.","Pablo Martinez (10%): Taylor Swift has been in<br />12 publicly known relationships. Her longest<br />relationship was with Joe Alwyn for 6 years. Out<br />of all her relationships, no one has ever been<br />engaged to Taylor swift as well. Kelce and Swift<br />have only been dating for 2 years so it would seem<br />very unlikely out of Taylor Swift character to<br />accept a proposal or be the one to propose. And<br />even if they do engage who's to say it will be<br />public by April 28th? it seems very unlikely and<br />seems more likely that they breakup and Taylor<br />then writes song about it.","Pablo Martinez (35%): December ended with a<br />2.9% inflation rate and the federal reserve<br />bank of clevands inflation now casting model, is<br />projecting for a 2.8% rate in January following<br />with a 2.6% in February . St. Louis fed also<br />projects that the yearly inflation rate will<br />cool down to 2.4% as well. Although much can<br />happen throughout the year that could change this<br />trajectory. It seems that not much will change<br />before the semester ends and seems that the trend<br />of inflation will stay around the 2.7% average<br />rate with a 3.0+ increase being more surprising .<br />However with trump putting tariffs on many<br />countries and basically inciting a trade war,<br />anything could happen to the economy it’s just<br />a matter of will it effect us by the end of the<br />semester","Quintin Gallardo (20%): Over the years, Taylor<br />Swift has been involved in many long-term<br />relationships. Several have lasted longer than<br />the current relationship between Travis Kelce and<br />Taylor Swift. The couple is also quite secluded<br />from the public sector as much as they possibly<br />can be, as they’ve only been several instances<br />weak to the media of them showing PDA. With<br />this being said even if they had potential to be<br />engaged before 28 April, I doubt it would become<br />public information.","Quintin Gallardo (70%): Inflation will most likely<br />be above 3% and at least one CPI report this<br />semester. The last one recorded was at 2.9 in<br />December 2024, meaning that potential lame from<br />the prior administration have yet to be included.<br />Along the reports, there was a trend of inflation<br />spiking in January of the years, where an<br />administration turned over. Additionally, trump’s<br />current policies on tariffs have a high potential<br />to initially increase inflation.","Rebecca Mcadam (35%): I think both Taylor Swift<br />and Travis Kelce are too involved in their<br />professional careers for a proposal to be on the<br />horizon. Kelce proposing at the Super Bowl would<br />cast a shadow on the actual game, which would<br />anger NFL fans. Also, if they were to get engaged,<br />I think it would be kept private by the couple.","Rebecca Mcadam (60%): Economic forecasters think<br />that the inflation rate is going to continue in<br />the pattern of decline that it has seen in recent<br />years throughout 2025. That being said, I think<br />the fact that the inflation rate is 2.9% coupled<br />with Trump's recent tariff policies will drive<br />up inflation in the United States and around the<br />world.","Riley Batz (30%): When asked in an interview on<br />Monday, February 3rd, whether he would propose at<br />the game, Travis simply responded, “Wouldn’t you<br />like to know.” His response leads me to believe<br />that he dislikes the rumours of his proposal at<br />the Superbowl and the fact that attention from<br />the team is being brought on his relationship<br />already- I don’t think there is any chance for<br />him to entirely steal the spotlight and propose<br />on Sunday. Regarding potential engagement from<br />now until April 28th, many people could argue<br />a foreseeable engagement based upon Travis and<br />Taylor’s ages (both 35). Despite statistics for<br />the general population of people their age, Travis<br />and Taylor are far outliers from the general<br />population. I find it hard to believe that the<br />couple will be engaged by the end of the semester.<br />The time for their engagement likely depends on<br />when either has time off. According to the NFL,<br />players have time off from mid-June to mid-July.<br />This gives the couple an opportunity to travel<br />and have time for themselves, a time in which an<br />engagement is more likely.","Riley Batz (60%): I am close to being 50/50<br />on this, given that the forecast for inflation<br />rates within the next 3 months is expected to<br />decrease. I believe that government spending<br />will be reduced, thus bringing inflation down.<br />However, given the recent tariffs implemented,<br />I am hesitant to believe that inflation will<br />be reduced within the next 3 months. The last<br />recorded inflation rate was 2.9% in December 2024.<br />Given this news, inflation in the United States<br />is expected to be 3.20 percent by the end of this<br />quarter, according to Trading Economics global<br />macro models and analysts expectations.","Sarah Joyce (50%): After doing some research,<br />I honestly feel like this is a coin toss. There<br />have been engagement rumors since the beginning<br />of their relationship in 2023, and none of those<br />have been correct. Additionally, they both seem<br />to be committed to keeping much of the details<br />of their relationship private. However, after<br />the Super Bowl it will be the first time in their<br />relationship where she will not have the Eras<br />Tour, and he will have a break from playing so it<br />is also possible that it might be the time they<br />choose to get engaged.","Sarah Joyce (65%): After doing some research, I<br />feel fairly uncertain, but I am leaning toward<br />the inflation rate reaching greater than 3% at<br />some point. Many economic outlooks by investment<br />banks that I found predicted that the rate would<br />continue to fall, but this was prior to Trump<br />taking office and beginning his trade war with<br />tariffs. Now with a rate of already 2.9%, more<br />are forecasting that we will likely see inflation<br />increase as a result, with a University of<br />Michigan consumer index predicting it to rise to<br />3.3%","Senait Pirani (35%): Taylor and Travis will have<br />been dating less than a year in April, and while<br />this relationship seems different than past ones,<br />drawing on her previous relationship patterns<br />would indicate that she is not eager to rush<br />into longterm commitment. She was in a previous<br />relationship with Joe Alwyn for six years without<br />an engagement, and has never been engaged, which<br />makes the probability that she would rush into an<br />engagement low.","Senait Pirani (77%): As of December 2024, the<br />CPI was 2.9, and with Trump's proposed tariffs<br />and already rising costs, I think it is likely<br />that the CPI will be either at or above 3% in the<br />near future. This would depend on if inflationary<br />pressure materializes quickly enough to be seen<br />during this semester.","Sreya Pandyaram (39%): The likelihood of a<br />proposal appears to be low, as numerous sources<br />have indicated that engagement is unlikely.<br />Additionally, there have been several instances<br />where speculation surrounding a potential<br />engagement arose, only to be unfulfilled, even<br />after significant milestones in the couple’s<br />relationship timeline. Also multiple sources note<br />that if the couple do get engaged, that it would<br />be a private moment and not something that will be<br />reveled immediately.","Sreya Pandyaram (79%): The U.S. inflation rate<br />is likely to exceed 3% due to recent developments<br />surrounding new tariffs on goods from Mexico,<br />Canada, and China. Mexico and Canada are two<br />of the United States’ largest trading partners,<br />and as a result, the imposition of these tariffs<br />is expected to increase costs for consumers.<br />According to a Wall Street Journal article<br />by Jeanne Whalen, the tariffs could lead to<br />significant supply chain disruptions, especially<br />at the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders. These<br />disruptions, coupled with higher import costs,<br />could drive up prices across various sectors, from<br />everyday consumer goods to industrial products.<br />The article also highlights the historical \"Trump<br />Effect\"—the inflationary impact of tariffs imposed<br />during former President Trump's administration.<br />Past tariff policies contributed to higher prices,<br />particularly in sectors reliant on imports, such<br />as electronics, automotive, and construction. If<br />the new tariffs mirror the same broad effects,<br />it is highly plausible that inflation could<br />surge again. However, the ultimate trajectory of<br />inflation will depend largely on how the Federal<br />Reserve responds. If the Fed acts decisively,<br />possibly with further interest rate hikes, it may<br />be able to temper inflation.","Teya Hagy (15%): I do not think they will get<br />engaged any time soon. I think that if they were<br />to get engaged this year, it would be towards the<br />end around December. Taylor Swift has had many<br />bad experiences with men and I think she will wait<br />this out as long as she can to make sure that he<br />is actually \"the one\". I also think that it would<br />be a strategically planned engagement and she will<br />get engaged on a date that is particular to her<br />life.","Teya Hagy (25%): I do not think that the inflation<br />rate will be greater than 3%. It is projected that<br />the inflation rate will not exceed 2.4% for the<br />year, therefore I do not think that it will go up<br />that much this semester, maybe the year. However,<br />the new tariffs may increase the number, but I do<br />not think it will rise that fast in half a year.","Thomas Smith (35%): Based on past secrecy within<br />her past relationships I find it unlikely that<br />this engagement is made public information before<br />April 28th. Taylor Swift based on past behavior<br />seems to enjoy a certain amount of privacy when it<br />comes to her relationships due to her being ripped<br />apart by the press on every single detail when it<br />comes to her boyfriends.","Tiyanah Rowtham (26%): Travis Kelce and Taylor<br />swift have been dating since September 2023.<br />Although I have only heard good things about<br />their relationship, I do not think they are end<br />game. And if they are, I’m unsure if they would<br />be engaged before April 28. The Kansas City<br />Chiefs are playing against the Philadelphia Eagles<br />and Travis Kelce is playing on this team. In my<br />opinion, his success this Sunday may influence the<br />chance of him proposing to Taylor Swift.","Tiyanah Rowtham (30%): The current US inflation<br />rate in the United States is 2.9%. The Inflation<br />rate has been on the decline, especially since<br />its high peak of 9% in June of 2022. While I do<br />predict that the inflation rate may be greater<br />than 3% during Trump's administration, I do not<br />think this will happen before the end of the<br />semester.","Townsend Turner (18%): From everything I’ve heard,<br />the couple plans to take things slow and I doubt<br />they will get engaged before summer. The only<br />thing that might make me think otherwise is that<br />both of them are a little older than the average<br />age for a first marriage. However, with the way<br />marriage is viewed for celebs nowadays, I doubt<br />they rush into it or commit to it by April 28.","Townsend Turner (73%): The inflation rate was 2.9<br />percent last month, is on a positive slope right<br />now, has been in recent history higher than it<br />is now, and only has to hit 3% one of the months<br />of the semester. All these are reasons to vote<br />likely; besides, I tend to take the over when it<br />comes to inflation.","Tristan Thompson (43%): I know little about how<br />Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship is<br />behind closed doors. The media’s glamorization<br />of events for the sake of a good story makes it<br />hard to truly know what is going on. However, I<br />do know that Taylor Swift has been part of many<br />relationships that have spanned many years past<br />where Travis and Taylor are currently. Taylor's<br />fame and demanding schedule makes it difficult to<br />commit to something as serious as marriage, and I<br />am sure that the same stands for Travis Kelce as<br />he competes for his third straight Super Bowl.","Tristan Thompson (70%): President Trump’s policies<br />facilitate the potential for the interest rate<br />percentage in the United States to reach above<br />three percent for many different reasons. Mass<br />deportations could cause supply chain issues due<br />to loss of employees, and tariffs could lead to<br />large price increases on imported goods. On top<br />of this, the bird flu has already wreaked havoc on<br />the poultry industry, causing the price of things<br />such as eggs to skyrocket.","Vangeli Tsiaras (15%): I think that Travis<br />Kelce and Taylor Swift's engagement will not be<br />announced before April 28th. While I think that<br />the couple will eventually decide to tie the knot,<br />it will occur later than April 28th. By this date<br />the couple's relationship will still be less than<br />two years old and is likely too soon of a date<br />for both Swift and Kelce, who are two people with<br />very different but very busy and time consuming<br />careers.","Vangeli Tsiaras (45%): The United States current<br />inflation rate sits at 2.9 percent which is down<br />from its peak of 7 percent in 2021 and 2022. Since<br />early 2022 the inflation rate has been decreasing<br />steadily. In his campaign for President, Donald<br />Trump made reducing the inflation rate a main<br />goal of his economic policy and agenda. While<br />Trump's newly imposed tariffs have recently been<br />in the spotlight as a new possibility of rising<br />inflation, I think that the U.S. inflation rate<br />will slightly decrease or stay the same and won't<br />meet its main goal of dropping to 2 percent but<br />will not exceed the 3 percent threshold.","Wyatt Dasher (20%): The odds that they will be<br />engaged are very low. This is because the most<br />likely event to do it at is the Super Bowl.<br />In which the chiefs have to win and he has to<br />propose. This just makes the odds against the<br />event happening. I could not find any new major<br />events for either of them. As Taylor swift was<br />just on the Grammys and it did not happen then.<br />I just don't see the date being this soon if they<br />do get engaged. There is also the fact that hs<br />his going one tour in 2026 and she just got off<br />another tour in December. She needs rot make a<br />new album, plan a wedding, and make new songs all<br />in the span of one year. That just seems like too<br />much.","Wyatt Dasher (65%): Many economist are saying that<br />the CPI is going to raise. On average it appears<br />to go up .3 a year. We are sitting at 2.9 as<br />of February 5th. So the likelihood that it will<br />increase seems in favor. But the question seems to<br />be one of time. Will the first 4 reports have an<br />increase. I believe that with the economic policy<br />change we will see some effects to inflation. I do<br />not strongly feel that it is likely to happen so I<br />am only putting 65%.","Wyatt Stevenson (45%): While the CPI reports come<br />out at the 12th of each month, recent changes<br />to the economy can determine the outcome of<br />inflation in coming months. The tariffs that Trump<br />implemented may cause inflation to rise in short<br />term just a little. The hold on tariff's for a<br />month with Mexico may help with not increasing the<br />inflation rate. On top of that, experts say that<br />the inflation rate will fall into the 2.4%-2.9%<br />range despite the tariff implementation. It is<br />hard to tell, but I think inflation will settle<br />down over time.","James Martin (33%): I think there is a 33% chance<br />Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift will be engaged<br />before April 28th. According to sources Travis<br />has no intentions of proposing in the near future.<br />But given they like to keep their personal life<br />private and with the Super Bowl coming up, there<br />is a chance he could propose if they get enough<br />enough pass interference calls and win the game.","James Martin (40%): I believe there is a 40%<br />probability that the US inflation rate will be<br />greater than 3% in any CPI report this semester.<br />As for the latest Consumer Price Index report, it<br />showed that the annual inflation rate for December<br />2024 was 2.9%. Given the fluctuations of the CPI<br />from month to month, it is possible to be greater<br />than 3%. With the disputes over the tariffs,<br />this could play a role in an increase in the CPI.<br />Also, the core CPI which excludes food and energy<br />prices was 3.2% in December so that could be an<br />underlying concern as well.","Ruby Douglas (70%): Because the annual inflation<br />rate in the US has risen for the past three<br />months. This suggests that there could be upward<br />pressure on prices. However, it is difficult to<br />predict what the fluctuations might be from month<br />to month. For example, if there are significant<br />shifts in those sectors or a sharp rise in oil<br />prices, inflation could tick back above 3% for<br />a given month. Furthermore, because the Core<br />CPI annual rate was 3.2%, a notch down from the<br />month before and slightly better than the 3.3%<br />outlook it appears to be that there is a slight<br />trend downwards. Some of Trump's policies that<br />he implements within the first 100 days regarding<br />tariffs could potentially backfire and result in a<br />period of time where the inflation rate is higher<br />than it should be."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will the effective tariff<br />rate on Canadian exports<br />to the US be higher than<br />10% on March 1?","Will the US inflation<br />rate be greater than 3%<br />in any CPI report this<br />semester?","Will Travis Kelce and<br />Taylor Swift be engaged<br />before April 28?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will the effective tariff<br />rate on Canadian exports<br />to the US be higher than<br />10% on March 1?","Will the US inflation<br />rate be greater than 3%<br />in any CPI report this<br />semester?","Will Travis Kelce and<br />Taylor Swift be engaged<br />before April 28?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"44c42b1a790":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"44c47f7d12f9":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"44c42b1a790","visdat":{"44c42b1a790":["function (y) ","x"],"44c47f7d12f9":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

There hasn't even been a bill introduced<br />yet (Senator Lummis' BITCOIN Act of 2024 was<br />introduced in the previous Congress), and seems<br />unlikely to be speedily adopted even if it were.<br />Could something like this be included as a budget<br />gimmick in the reconciliation bill? I guess that<br />possibility is what keeps me from putting this at<br />0%. Ironically, the federal government *already*<br />owns a substantial share of the world's Bitcoin<br />supply (about 200,000), mostly seized through<br />criminal investigations. Honestly, that seems<br />like a much more cost-effective way to acquire a<br />Bitcoin reserve than to buy it at inflated prices.","Joe Ornstein (0%): Judging by the polling (which<br />in Germany is generally quite accurate) the<br />far-right AfD is about to have its best election<br />ever. Following the collapse of the current<br />SPD-led coaltion, AfD is on track to double its<br />popular vote from 10% to 20%, which should make<br />it the second-largest party in the Bundestag.<br />The CDU/CSU will almost certainly return to<br />its pre-2021 place as the largest party in the<br />Bundestag, and will be given the opportunity to<br />form a coalition. So the question boils down to:<br />will the center-right choose to form a coalition<br />with the AfD, or revert to a grand coalition with<br />the left (grobe Koalition, or \"GroKo\" in German)<br />that leaves the AfD out? Here the CDU leader<br />Friedrich Merz has been pretty unequivocal, saying<br />\"I can assure voters in Germany of one thing very<br />clearly: We will not work with the party that<br />calls itself the Alternative for Germany. Not<br />before, not after, never.\" Depending on how many<br />small parties cross the 5% threshold, we're most<br />likely to see either a CDU/SPD coalition or a<br />three-party CDU/SPD/Green coalition.","Joe Ornstein (15%): The base rate of these<br />declarations is roughly one every two years<br />since 2005, which suggests something like a<br />10% chance over a three-month period. I'll bump<br />that to 15% given the ongoing spread of avian<br />flu in the United States, but with no confirmed<br />human-to-human transmission and the reported<br />numbers in poultry flocks declining in recent<br />weeks it seems unlikely to result in a (human)<br />epidemic at this

Diaz (5%): I think it is highly unlikely<br />that Congress will pass legislation establishing a<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by April 28. The BITCOIN<br />Act of 2024 was just introduced to the senate<br />in July of 2024. While I have little to no doubt<br />that it will pass, I still find it difficult for<br />this timeframe due to it still being in the early<br />legislative process and taking into account how<br />lengthy and sometimes complicated these things can<br />be, I can’t see it passing before or by April 28.","Aaliyah Diaz (10%): I think that it is highly<br />unlikely that the WHO will declare a new Public<br />Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)<br />before April 28. As of today, they have only ever<br />declared a new eight Public Health Emergencies<br />of International Concern. The last reported<br />disease was in 2024 and concerned monkeypox.<br />While it is extremely difficult to determine the<br />unpredictability of a disease, I don’t think one<br />will be declared before April 28.","Addisen Kameron (20%): 20% Trump has spoken<br />about crypto but I don’t see it as one of his top<br />priorities. He signed the execute order creating a<br />task force for digital assets and I saw something<br />saying he wanted a plan in six months. I don’t<br />think congress would love this idea and I just<br />don’t see it happening this soon if it happens at<br />all. Too many unknowns and seems too irrelevant<br />right now but I’m also not a crypto bro so I could<br />be very off.","Addisen Kameron (35%): I think there is a 35%<br />chance. From what I understood, the new president<br />and chancellor will select the cabinet members<br />based on who they form a coalition with. After<br />Merz’s highly unpopular comments regarding getting<br />AfD votes for his immigration bill, resulting<br />in enormous protests and criticisms from big<br />figures, I think it's unlikely he continues to<br />poke the bear. The AfD is justifiably kept out<br />of coalitions due to its extremist and alt-right<br />positions, and while they’re breaking into the<br />political norm I think establishing them in a<br />cabinet position would be massively unpopular.","Andreas Papandreou (25%): The AfD is not polling<br />high enough to win a large enough percentage of<br />the seats in the German government. The CDU is the<br />likely winner and will look to form a coalition<br />government with the center-left SPD. With the<br />overwhelming likelihood that the coalition<br />government will be between the SPD and the CDU<br />and the CDU already saying they will not coalition<br />with the AfD, I find it unlikely that the AfD<br />holds a cabinet position following the February<br />election.","Andy Wyatt (5%): A Bitcoin reserve act has not<br />yet been introduced by any federal legislator.<br />Although Senator Cynthia Lummis sponsored the<br />BITCOIN Act of 2024, she has not re-introduced<br />it as of this writing. Even if a bill is proposed<br />soon, the length of the legislative process<br />and the fact that Congress passes a miniscule<br />share of legislation are significant barriers.<br />An additional complication is the President’s<br />executive order on digital financial technology,<br />which directs a working group to make a report<br />to him within 180 days of the order’s issuance.<br />Assuming it will take the group the full 180<br />days, they would meet the deadline outside of<br />the 100 day window. Congress will likely want to<br />wait until the report is completed before moving<br />forward with new legislation on a strategic<br />reserve.","Andy Wyatt (5%): Because all of the major parties<br />have refused to entertain AfD, the party will need<br />to win an outright majority to have any cabinet<br />ministers. That scenario seems very unlikely.<br />Currently, AfD stands a 3% chance of winning more<br />than 30% of the vote, according to Polymarket.<br />Polls project the AfD to receive 20.7% of the<br />vote, well short of the 50% they would need.<br />AfD’s main hope of governance would then be it and<br />CDU capturing a majority of the vote, but CDU’s<br />candidate for chancellor vowed that they would not<br />engage with AfD whatsoever.","Andy Wyatt (10%): A PHEIC is “an extraordinary<br />event which is determined to constitute a<br />public health risk to other States through the<br />international spread of disease and to potentially<br />require a coordinated international response.”<br />Bird flu is the most pressing public health<br />problem globally. Over 500 bird species and 70<br />mammalian species have been infected. However,<br />bird flu mainly threatens food security. The<br />CDC has confirmed only 68 human cases since the<br />outbreak began in the U.S., and there have been<br />zero reports of human-to-human transmission. The<br />risk of human spread is certainly rising, but<br />still low in the short-term.","Angela Jacobs (12%): With President Trump's<br />executive order aiming to boost the U.S. crypto<br />industry and the creation of a working group to<br />focus on digital asset development, the U.S. is<br />shifting toward more crypto-friendly legislation.<br />However, despite these positive signals, creating<br />a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve requires a complex<br />policy shift which will likely take Congress<br />longer to agree on. With the working group in<br />place and ongoing discussions, the probability<br />of legislation passing by April 28, 2025 could<br />rise slightly, but it’s still a longshot. I’d say<br />the likelihood is about 12% based on the recent<br />executive actions and working group formation.","Angela Jacobs (19%): Given that a PHEIC is<br />already in effect for mpox, the likelihood of<br />the WHO declaring an additional PHEIC before<br />April 28, 2025, depends on the emergence of new<br />public health threats that meet the criteria.<br />These criteria include an event that is serious,<br />unusual, poses a risk of international spread, and<br />may require an international response. Currently,<br />there are no publicly reported events that meet<br />these criteria. However, public health situations<br />can evolve rapidly. Considering the unpredictable<br />nature of infectious diseases and other health<br />threats, I would estimate the probability of the<br />WHO declaring a new PHEIC before April 28, 2025,<br />to be approximately 19%.","Anna Rachwalski (15%): Polymarket's at 14%<br />right now, with $6,804,254 in bets made on this<br />question. I'm going with the substantial crowd<br />here, and banking on the randomness of the Trump<br />administration. They really do like to throw ideas<br />like this out, see the public reaction, and drop<br />them if they're not hot anymore. We don't really<br />have any other sort of reserves like this, too, so<br />there's pretty much no precedent or framework to<br />follow.","Anna Rachwalski (10%): Despite the fact that CDU<br />leader Merz has shown more sympathy to the AfD in<br />recent weeks, he, and every other major party, has<br />still affirmed that he will not form a coalition<br />with them to take control. If the AfD isn't part<br />of that coalition, they're not getting a cabinet<br />position. As such, I think the probability is very<br />low that this will occur.","Anna Rachwalski (40%): No sustained human-to-human<br />transmission has been identified associated<br />with the recent reported human infections with<br />avian influenza. Until that happens, it feels<br />unlikely that the WHO would declare it a PHEIC.<br />With the randomness of public health events, some<br />cautiousness lingering from Covid-19, and extra<br />randomness interspersed from the US's recent exit<br />from the US, my prediction is slightly bumped up.","Archita Gaur (35%): I don’t think Congress will<br />be able to pass legislation establishing a bitcoin<br />reserve before April 28th. The only bill I see<br />that currently would do this is the BITCOIN Act<br />but it has just been introduced and Congress<br />doesn’t seem likely to pass it unless the task<br />force that Trump created through his executive<br />order deems the reserve to actually be strategic.<br />They have 180 days to give their report and that<br />makes me believe that legislation will most likely<br />not be passed before April 28th.","Archita Gaur (34%): I don't really understand<br />what the Bundesregierung is but even though there<br />is some support for AFD is government, I don<br />think they will be able to form a coalition with<br />the other parties in order to get spots. They<br />are highly disliked by other parties. All other<br />parties have ruled out working with them.","Archita Gaur (20%): While there is a chance that<br />there might an outbreak of some disease that will<br />trigger this concern, it is highly unlikely that<br />any of the current diseases will progress to this<br />level. Additionally, the politicization of the<br />process will attempt to delay the trigger for as<br />long as possible with any disease.","Ava Herring (11%): The bill is still stuck with<br />the Senate Finance Committee and has yet to have<br />any hearings or votes. Even if the bill passes<br />through the Senate, it still needs to be approved<br />by the House of Representatives as well as the<br />President before it can be established. The<br />Legislative Process usually takes a long time,<br />making it very unlikely that this will happen<br />before April 28, if at all.","Ava Herring (15%): Based on the current<br />political standpoint, I believe that it is<br />highly unlikely for the AfD to hold any positions<br />within the German Cabinet. Major German parties<br />have explicitly stated that they will not be<br />collaborating with the AfD. Although the AfD<br />has somewhat of a strong poll, I do not believe<br />that it will have enough support to form its own<br />government based on current information.","Ayaan Fazal (5%): I believe that within the<br />2-3 month time frame, there will be almost no<br />chance that the United States successfully passes<br />legislation establishing a Strategic Bitcoin<br />Reserve. Recently, President Trump established a<br />working group to explore the feasibility behind<br />stockpiling Bitcoin. The findings are expected<br />to take at least 180 days making it improbable<br />to successfully establish a reserve for bitcoin.<br />Even such a major proposal would require public<br />acceptance, bipartisan support, etc.","Ayaan Fazal (15%): Given that German political<br />parties are not permitted to collude with one<br />another, it is very unlikely that the AfD have<br />any majority in the following elections. The party<br />has not gained liking from the majority of German<br />citizens, especially following the terrorist<br />attack.","Ayaan Fazal (15%): As there has not been any major<br />outbreaks/diseases lingering the Earth, I find it<br />improbable with a short window of time, that the<br />WHO declares any emergency. The only potential<br />outbreak that could be declared is the Bird Flu.<br />I find it unlikely that there will be another<br />outbreak announced in only two months.","Bailey Mattox (2%): While Trump has talked a<br />lot about establishing a bitcoin reserve, I<br />just don't think there's much of a chance of it<br />happening before April 28. As Jerome Powell has<br />pointed out, the Federal Reserve is currently<br />not authorized to hold Bitcoin under current<br />law. So first, that problem would need to be<br />handled through legislation. Then, there is the<br />problem that crypto is volatile and there is<br />significant pushback from people who do not trust<br />bitcoin or any type of digital currency. The<br />only reason I even gave it 2% is that Trump and<br />his PACs collected 130 million dollars from the<br />cryptocurrency industry in his run for office and<br />he has signed an executive order that aimed to<br />\"evaluate the potential creation and maintenance<br />of a national digital asset stockpile\". I think<br />this is a priority for him, but I think it will<br />take a lot longer than two and a half months.","Bailey Mattox (5%): It really seems unlikely.<br />The AfD has never held a federal or even a state<br />ministry position and the other major parties<br />will not cooperate with the AfD. Recently the<br />most popular pick for chancellor, Friedrich Merz,<br />agreed with the AfD on a migration policy and<br />there have been mass protests against him. If Merz<br />becomes chancellor (which it looks like he will<br />given that he is up by more than ten percentage<br />points in the polls), I don't think he will put<br />any AfD members in his cabinet. He has been very<br />vocal about his disdain for Elon Musk supporting<br />them and he has said publicly that he did not<br />directly collaborate with the AfD.","Bailey Mattox (10%): The average time between<br />PHEIC declarations has been about two years and<br />the last declaration they released was in August<br />of 2024, though it is worth noting that it seems<br />that the declarations have been getting closer<br />together. Public health crises can be very hard<br />to predict, but based on this pattern, I don't<br />think there will be an outbreak before April 28th<br />especially considering that I did not find any<br />evidence of a global health crisis that could<br />qualify in the near future.","Benjamin Jacobstein (10%): I don't think Congress<br />will enact legislation that would allow for the<br />establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve,<br />much less by April. Even though the president has<br />promised to make America the \"crypto capital of<br />the planet\" and this is a hot topic, the BITCOIN<br />Act of 2024 did not move forward before the 118th<br />Congress adjourned. Despite the strong desire to<br />make this happen, the legislative process is still<br />complicated and time-consuming, so I do not think<br />this will be resolved by April 28.","Benjamin Jacobstein (0%): In short, while the<br />AfD will hold Bundestag seats and influence<br />legislative debates, they are very unlikely to<br />be part of the federal government or at least<br />hold executive power. Cabinet positions require<br />coalition agreements, and all major parties have<br />ruled out working with the AfD, making their<br />participation in government nearly impossible.","Benjamin Jacobstein (5%): It seems that the only<br />ongoing concern with the potential to become a<br />PHEIC is Bird Flu (H5N1). For this to happen, the<br />virus would likely need to mutate for sustained<br />human-to-human transmission, which recent research<br />suggests is possible but I believe is unlikely<br />to happen before April 28. Additionally, since<br />PHEICs are declared approximately every 2.5 years<br />on average, the timing further points to the fact<br />that a declaration this soon is unlikely.","Bennie Trujillano (15%): I'm actually somewhat<br />confident that legislation for a BitCoin reserve<br />will eventually be made into law at some point,<br />but it seems unlikely that it will ever happen<br />before April 28th. While it was one of Trump's<br />campaign promises, I don't see it making it<br />through congress anytime soon. It's been discussed<br />at the federal level for a while, but it never<br />feels like its making any substantial progress.","Bennie Trujillano (60%): According to most sources<br />I've found, there is about a 90% chance that<br />Friedrich Merz and the right leaning CDU will win<br />in the upcoming German election. Assuming that<br />this occurs, I can imagine that an AFD member<br />being appointed to a position in the cabinet is<br />very possible. While Merz insists that there will<br />be no cooperation with AFD, they have worked on<br />immigration law together in the past despite the<br />refusal of other parties to do so. The tremendous<br />amount of traction AFD has gained in just the past<br />two years is also worth taking into account.","Bennie Trujillano (10%): It feels very unlikely<br />that the WHO will announce another PHEIC before<br />April 28th. The only current risk is bird flu,<br />which is present, but the risk of spreading is<br />very low according to the CDC, as it typically<br />isn't spread by mammals. Also, the speculative<br />odds of a pandemic occurring float around 5%-15%<br />on poly market.","Brooke Cheney (20%): The AfD is extremely<br />right-wing party that has actually increased in<br />favorability over the past eight years unlike<br />some other major political parties in Germany,<br />according to Pew Research. According to YouGov,<br />the AfD party is projected to secure around 20% of<br />the vote, which would make it the second largest<br />party in Germany. However, due to their extremist<br />beliefs on immigration, climate change, and<br />other salient topics, many of the other parties<br />have dismissed the idea of forming a coalition<br />with them. Therefore, even if AfD performs well,<br />a probable coalition would completely exclude<br />the AfD from securing one of the 16 ministry<br />positions.","Brooke Cheney (14%): Since 2005, there have<br />only been 8 PHEICs. Therefore, I feel like the<br />likelihood of one happening in the next 2 months<br />is low. However, we have seen the rise of Rhino<br />virus, and I feel like that will be one of the<br />only diseases to make my prediction wrong.","Chinelo Ireh (12%): While there are multiple state<br />legislatures in the early stages of developing<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserves, it is highly unlikely<br />that Congress will pass anything about it. A<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a supply of money<br />stored in cryptocurrency. There has been a<br />push for legislatures to create cryptocurrency<br />reserves. There was a bill introduced in the<br />Senate last year about starting a Strategic<br />Bitcoin Reserve but it never made it off of the<br />floor. President Trump has centered cryptocurrency<br />at his economic policy but I doubt that Congress<br />could get anything done this fast.","Chinelo Ireh (57%): In the upcoming German<br />election, the conservative Christian Democratic<br />Union (CDU) and its Baravian sister party the<br />Christian Social Union (CSU) are predicted to win<br />a majority. The CDU and CSD have also recently<br />allied themselves with the far-right Alternative<br />for Germany (AfD) party. The current makeup of the<br />Bundesregierung largely represents the makeup of<br />the current proportion of the Bundestag, which is<br />led by SDP and its allies in the Green Party. The<br />AfD is likely to hold at least one seat because of<br />its coalition with the conservative parties that<br />are likely to win.","Chinelo Ireh (10%): The WHO has been more<br />reluctant to declare a new Public Health Emergency<br />of International Concern since 2020 because of<br />how dramatic the response is. Also, there will be<br />a 20% budget cut from President Trump that will<br />diminish WHO's ability to operate properly, which<br />reduces the likelihood even further.","Chloe Cooper (8%): Although Trump has talked about<br />making this happening, the federal reserve has<br />expressed lots of disapproval towards the idea,<br />vowing that they will not support the bitcoin<br />reserve. There isn't much clarity on what an<br />actual Federal Bitcoin Reserve would look like<br />either, will Trump not giving much details on<br />his plan to actually enact this reserve. I also<br />looked at an article detailing the thoughts of<br />a cryptocurrency analyst (whatever that means)<br />that said that its more likely that Trump doesn't<br />sign an executive order, but rather continues<br />buying bitcoin in the back ground so the price<br />doesn't run away from him. Also important to note<br />Polymarket has the likelihood of this occurring<br />in Trump's first 100 days (which conveniently ends<br />two days after the semester ends) at 12%, which I<br />feel like is a fair estimate. I believe that the<br />reserve has a solid chance of happening eventually<br />but probably not before the semester ends.","Chloe Cooper (6%): The next chancellor of Germany<br />is almost guaranteed to be Friedrich Merz of<br />the Christian Democrats party, as he is heavily<br />favored in the upcoming election on February 23rd.<br />If he does end up becoming chancellor then he gets<br />to appoint his own cabinet members and has gone<br />on record saying that he will \"never\" work with<br />the AfD. The only reason it isn't lower than 6% is<br />because Merz did accept political support from AfD<br />voters and the AfD is increasing in its popularity<br />among the German people, which could lead Merz to<br />be more willing to possibly give someone from that<br />party a shot at a seat in the cabinet.","Chloe Cooper (14%): From what I've seen online<br />there doesn't seem to be any new developing<br />virus or disease that is concerning enough to be<br />considered a new PHEIC any time soon. The closest<br />thing is the Clade 1 mpox disease which was<br />already declared a PHEIC by the WHO in August of<br />last year. There have only been a total of 8 total<br />PHEIC declared since 2005, but 4 of them have come<br />since 2019 with the most recent two being about<br />monkeypox. The most likely way that this resolves<br />as a yes is a new variant of mpox occurring,<br />different from the clade 1 and clade 2 that<br />are already declared a PHEIC, but it seems like<br />those two labels of the disease cover everything<br />regarding monkey pox for the foreseeable future.","Da In Song (10%): While I do agree that bitcoin<br />in particular has grown more and more valuable<br />over the years due to limited stock, reasonable<br />value/time, and international trading capacity,<br />the downsides are too big for a government to<br />risk. The silk road based its purchasing power<br />on bitcoin, as well as many off-shore paper<br />companies from China and Russia. The government's<br />involvement would require a long process of<br />legitimization, control, and various cybersecurity<br />measures that I do not think people are taking<br />into consideration. I do admit this probability<br />has been heavily biased by my pre-conception of<br />the usage of bitcoin, but if the US Treasury is<br />interested in buying 200,000 bitcoins for 5 years<br />as the bill envisions... it would have to be from<br />legitimate vendors and bitcoin miners.","Da In Song (20%): First, considering the banning<br />of parties in Germany, it seems like the process<br />takes more than a year as \"the parliament<br />(Bundestag), the Federal Council (Bundesrat)<br />and the government can apply to the Federal<br />Constitutional Court to ban a party for its<br />anti-constitutional goals or anti-democratic<br />behavior\", but there are only \"113 out of<br />734 members of parliament\" who backed the ban<br />proposal. Second, the German law also states<br />\"the electoral bodies do not check during the<br />election procedure whether political parties are<br />unconstitutional\", which means the election itself<br />may proceed regardless of whether the ban goes<br />through now or earlier. While most party members<br />are trying to ban the AfD before the election,<br />the lack of support and the AfD's major voter base<br />makes all this happening before the 23rd seems<br />impossible. They may hold positions, but they will<br />lose it if the ban goes through.","Da In Song (60%): Considering the speed in which<br />WHO can declare a PHEIC, the pattern seen with<br />previous outbreaks in 2000-2020, and the weather<br />around the world in January-April of this year, I<br />am asusming a higher percentage than I would like.<br />This is because a PHEIC can be declared within<br />a week at the fastest. The pattern seen before<br />with previous outbreaks, in terms of interval<br />from first observation of disease to declaration<br />of PHEIC, is extremely irregular. Colder weathers<br />are more prone to start an outbreak than warmer<br />weathers. In consideration of all these factors, I<br />reluctantly predict a 60% chance of a PHEIC being<br />issued, and am unable to predict whether a disease<br />will spread, as that is near impossible.","Diane Johnson (18%): Although the AfD won the<br />state election for Thuringia in September 2024,<br />this victory is insignificant compared to the<br />majorities in Germany’s 15 other states. Their<br />popularity is still less than the CDU and is<br />unlikely to surpass. The party has been growing in<br />popularity partially because of Trump’s and Musk’s<br />influence in America but despite this there is<br />still an overwhelming majority that is against the<br />AfD. Even as the 2nd most popular political party<br />in Germany right now the leaders of the CDU have<br />committed to not forming coalitions with the AfD<br />so it is highly unlikely.","Diane Johnson (10%): I think it is highly unlikely<br />that a new PHEIC will be declared by April 28th<br />because there is currently no known new strand<br />of a disease that is circulating in a region or<br />crossing international borders. The illnesses that<br />already exist have treatment options available,<br />even COVID-19 can be treated since there has been<br />enough research put into it. Many are troubled<br />by the Bird Flu but this sickness is hardly ever<br />transmissible from person to person so it has less<br />opportunities to infect other humans.","Eli Henderson (37%): I first checked Polymarkets'<br />odds for a bitcoin reserve this entire year,<br />and it was only around the mid-40s which made<br />me skeptical on the likelihood of a bill being<br />passed. Furthermore, only 2 congressmen have<br />bought cryptocurrency since 2021, and given how<br />Congress likes to personally get ahead of things<br />that could aid them financially, I don't foresee<br />legislation passing for a strategic Bitcoin<br />reserve before the end of the semester.","Eli Henderson (18%): The current scope of<br />outbreaks internationally and within the US<br />struggle to conform to the criteria listed by<br />the IHR to consider a PHEIC declaration for the<br />most part. Dengue is the most likely, but it<br />has far less media coverage, isn't transmissible<br />by humans, and is mostly endemic to tropical<br />climates. Bird flu is receiving sensationalism<br />and coverage, which has the public in fear, but<br />the handling of the situation by poultry farmers,<br />the low number of human cases, and the fears of<br />another controversy like they had when declaring<br />swine flu a PHEIC indicates to me the chance they<br />declare is incredibly low","Elliana Williams (25%): Trump originally said<br />that he would immediately work towards a strategic<br />bitcoin reserve, however it seems unlikely that it<br />is moving fast and toward legislation that require<br />purchase of a certain amount of Bitcoin. Though<br />certain states have went ahead and made individual<br />legislation, it seems it is more likely that the<br />US will reserve what it has already purchased, and<br />if they do pass legislation I do not think it will<br />be before April 28.","Elliana Williams (10%): There is no way to know<br />for sure, however, a public health emergency of<br />international concern is extreme, and the US would<br />have to declare it. Though there may be concerns<br />in other countries, the US does not currently have<br />something that could be of international concern.<br />There is the bird flu and the potential for that<br />to spread to humans, however, I do not believe<br />that will be of international concern.","Emma Allen (43%): Despite momentum for a bill<br />to be passed, I do not think Congress will pass<br />legislation establishing a Strategic Bitcoin<br />Reserve by April 28. In July of 2024, Senator<br />Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act. Sources<br />say the legislation is scheduled to be heard<br />by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and<br />Urban Affairs later this year. I find that crypto<br />legislation is just simply not a top priority for<br />Congress right now due to all the election year<br />shifts of focus. I do, however, see a high chance<br />for this legislation to pass eventually, just not<br />by April 28th.","Emma Allen (34%): The AfD lost ground in the first<br />half of last year but since then has been on the<br />rise in polls and now has about 21 percent of<br />popular support across the country. This places<br />them potentially in second place behind the<br />Christian Democratic Union. Sources say the most<br />probable outcome appears to be a grand coalition<br />between the CDU and the Social Democratic Party<br />(SPD). I find it unlikely because there remains<br />a clear majority of anti-far right parties in<br />Germany that would not want to work with the AfD<br />and it would take a monumental shift to change<br />that.","Emma Allen (28%): The most recent PHEIC was<br />declared in August 2024 over the mpox outbreak. To<br />my knowledge the current mpox PHEIC is an ongoing<br />battle. For this reason, I do not find it likely<br />that the WHO declares another before April 28th.<br />There were only 6 events declared within the years<br />2006-2020, so a PHEIC is not likely to begin with<br />and we recently just witnessed one making it more<br />unlikely another one will be soon in the future.","Emma Pastor (38%): S.4912 - BITCOIN Act of 2024<br />was introduced to the Senate in July of 2024,<br />before being referred back to committee, and<br />is currently pending in the US Senate. However,<br />the fact that this legislature has been drafted<br />and introduced to Senate leads me to believe<br />that there is potential for a bitcoin reserve<br />to be established, as it would simply take them<br />passing the bill. However, the time frame of this<br />occurring within the first 100 days of Trump's<br />presidency seems a little sudden, especially<br />considering the fact that the passing of this<br />legislation could potentially increase the price<br />of bitcoin.","Emma Pastor (55%): While I have very minimal<br />knowledge on the German government and how it<br />functions, based on my preliminary research it<br />seems as though the prospect of the Alternative<br />for Germany party, a far-right party in the<br />nation, holding any positions in the German<br />cabinet is not guaranteed, but probable. This<br />is due to the expressed refusal to work with AfD<br />politicians by members of the Christian Democratic<br />Union (a mainstream party in the nation), such as<br />party leader Friedrich Merz. However, supporting<br />the party has started to become less taboo in the<br />country, as it gains more followers than it has<br />had previously, and they are projected by some to<br />be the second most popular party in this election.","Emma Pastor (35%): Since 2009, there have been 8<br />Public Health Emergencies of International Concern<br />declared. The most recent of these declarations<br />was in August of 2024 for the mpox outbreak,<br />with the emergency still ongoing (not officially<br />declared as over by the WHO). The fact that this<br />crisis is still ongoing, and there have only<br />been a few PHEICs that have overlapped over the<br />past two decades, leads me to believe the chances<br />of another being declared in the next couple of<br />months is low. However, with bridflu cases rising<br />within the livestock and poultry industries,<br />and human cases beginning to surface, there is<br />a possibility that this outbreak could become<br />an issue among humans and be deemed a PHEIC,<br />depending on if/how quickly it spreads.","Emma Peterson (40%): I put 40% because the more I<br />think about this question the less confident I am<br />that legislation will be passed for bitcoin. Most<br />probability websites have kept their odds of Trump<br />establishing a bitcoin reserve in his first 100<br />days very low. I think at the federal level there<br />are lower odds of it occurring in the beginning of<br />the year as opposed to the middle/end because if<br />it does happen I don't think it will be as soon as<br />April. I also believe that it would need to start<br />occurring at the state level first before it moves<br />to federal.","Emma Peterson (65%): I put 65% because according<br />to the preliminary polls right now, they are<br />trailing behind the CDU, but not by much. Most<br />articles are expecting the AfD party to gain<br />seats in the cabinet, alongside the CDU come the<br />February 23rd election. Some even say they have<br />gained a good amount of public support, leading<br />me to think their chance is pretty high. The<br />only reason that my prediction is not higher than<br />65% right now is because they are known as an<br />extremist group, and very against immigration,<br />which may not sit well with voters.","Emma Peterson (35%): The reason I put 35% is<br />because I don't think there will be something as<br />drastic as COVID-19 in the coming months. It's<br />important to note the WHO only declared the public<br />health emergency of Covid over in the beginning<br />of 2023, 3 years after it first became an issue.<br />This means public health emergencies are to be<br />used sparingly and only when something meets its<br />criteria. This being said, the only thing that<br />worries me currently is the Bird Flu. I have<br />seen many reports that it does not seem to pose<br />an immediate threat to public health, but the<br />virus is evolving as time passes so I did leave<br />some room to account for that. However in the<br />end I don't think it will be enough to declare an<br />emergency by April 28 because it does seem to be<br />evolving at a relatively slow speed.","Ethan Joyce (2%): I estimate the probability of<br />AfD holding a cabinet position at 2%, given their<br />overwhelming rejection by mainstream parties.<br />The Union, SPD, the Greens, and others refuse<br />to govern with AfD due to its extreme views.<br />Additionally, the most likely coalition is a<br />coalition between Union and SPD, which excludes<br />AfD entirely. No viable coalition includes<br />AfD, and it lacks potential partners to reach a<br />governing majority. While the party is polling<br />second, historical precedent suggests it will<br />remain politically isolated. The only conceivable<br />but highly unlikely path to this happening would<br />be an extreme political upheaval post-election.<br />Or, if the AfD wins enough seats that they have<br />an outright majority (although that is not what<br />polling indicates will occur).","Ethan Marcum (30%): I feel that this will occur,<br />just not within two months. I feel that congress<br />is too convoluted of an entity that would take too<br />long to pass into law. I also feel that this could<br />be absolved if enough states pass a bill for their<br />own treasury. So far, 18 states have passed a bill<br />to establish a reserve of their own. For this to<br />stem into a federal issue, I feel there needs to<br />be more strategy as to how much bitcoin is bought<br />and they also need to deliberate over how much<br />money this will cost. Again, I feel this will<br />happen, but for this to occur, I feel there would<br />need to be serious fast tracking.","Ethan Marcum (70%): The party is becoming less<br />taboo and growing in the public. It seems that the<br />government vows to limit the influence they have<br />in office, but it seems that there is a legitimate<br />chance, or concern, that they will end up there. I<br />can see where there is possibility that there are<br />none","Ethan Marcum (38%): There currently is a PHEIC<br />for mpox out, so I doubt there would be another<br />issuing. However, there have been rare cases in<br />the past that have made it so that there were<br />multiple at once. I feel that is rare, and that<br />it is also monitored for quite some time before<br />one is issued. There seems to be no real indicator<br />that in the next 2 months there will be another<br />PHEIC issued. There are some diseases at a level<br />2 right now, but I feel that it would take longer<br />than 2 months for those to warrant a PHEIC.","Grace Mccann (25%): I think it is unlikely that<br />congress will pass legislation establishing a<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by April 28? Trump<br />want to do this but it would need significant<br />congressional approval and I simply do not think<br />that is enough time. However im still putting<br />my probability at 25% because trump can be quite<br />radical and move quite quickly when he wants.","Grace Mccann (22%): The AfD party is quite radical<br />and not very established in Germany as they were<br />only were created in 2013. Also Friedrich Merz<br />the most promising candidate for the chancellor<br />of Germany said there would not no cooperation<br />with AfD and that he wants to make them as small<br />as possible. I think that this also might speak to<br />how a lot of Germany might feel about the party as<br />Merz is the most popular candidate at this point.","Grace Mccann (20%): The WHO has only declared<br />6 PHEICs in between 2007 and 2020. This is a<br />relatively low number especially considering<br />during this time we had issues like Zika and Covid<br />19. I think the only thing that is on the publics<br />minds as of now that could be a problem is the<br />Avian Flu however this has not become a human<br />concern quite yet.","Grace Reichelderfer (40%): Sixteen US states are<br />considering Bitcoin as part of their investment<br />strategies, with legislation to allow public<br />funds to be allocated to such digital assets<br />already under discussion. However, I do not think<br />establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will<br />be a top priority in the next two months. Over<br />the course of Trump’s term, I could see this<br />happening. I just do not think it will be by April<br />28th.","Grace Reichelderfer (58%): CDU leader Friedrich<br />Merz – tipped to become Germany’s new chancellor<br />– proposed a motion on tougher migration rules,<br />known as the five-point plan, that passed with<br />the backing of the AfD. The Federal Chancellor<br />chooses the Federal Ministers and the departments<br />for which they are to be responsible. He submits<br />a binding proposal to the Federal President on<br />the basis of which he appoints or dismisses the<br />Ministers. If Merz is elected the new chancellor,<br />it seems likely that he will work closely with<br />the AfD party, possibly nominating one for the<br />cabinet.","Grace Reichelderfer (30%): A PHEIC is a formal<br />declaration by WHO of ‘an extraordinary event<br />which is determined to constitute a public health<br />risk to other States through the international<br />spread of disease and to potentially require a<br />coordinated international response.’ Six events<br />were declared PHEIC between 2007 and 2020,<br />COVID-19 being the most recent. However I do not<br />think there will be one in the next few months.","Hampton Barrineau (25%): The clowns of the crypto<br />world have an ally in Trump, but frankly I don’t<br />think his administration cares enough to pass such<br />legislation so fast into his first term. The only<br />reason why such legislation is being considered<br />is because Trump had a “meme coin” and the crypto<br />community gave hundreds of millions of dollars to<br />influence the election. If this happens, it will<br />be a cynical push nearer the midterms.","Hampton Barrineau (20%): For the AFD to get a<br />cabinet seat, they must be part of a governing<br />coalition. While this might seem plausible at<br />first with them being polled as the second most<br />popular party, their closest politically aligned<br />party, the CDU/CSU, are insistent that they will<br />never govern along side the AFD with party figures<br />like Angela Merkel even opposed to the parties<br />working together on passing legislation.","Hampton Barrineau (20%): Admittedly, this is<br />one of my least researched questions, but given<br />the recent outbreak of disease affecting Chicken<br />prices and renewed focus on pandemics following<br />COVID-19, I believe that it is unlikely at<br />this time nor the immediate future for such an<br />emergency.","Hannah Carson (10%): I do not believe Congress<br />will pass legislation establishing a Strategic<br />Bitcoin Reserve by April 28th. Although<br />there has been acts in the works for this and<br />President Trump has made statements endorsing<br />cryptocurrency, legislative proceedings are very<br />slow and I couldn't see this being passed by<br />April 28th. Additionally, cryptocurrency doesn't<br />seem anywhere near ready to be used at a national<br />level. Its value is just too unreliable to be used<br />wide spread like the US dollar.","Hannah Carson (20%): AfD will likely hold about<br />20% of Bundestag, but will not hold positions<br />in Bundesregierung. I believe this because the<br />mainstream parties of the German government have<br />ruled out working with AfD. Additionally, they<br />will win significant votes but don't have many<br />coalition partners which will make it hard to get<br />a position in Bundesregierung. Also, AFD has never<br />held a spot in Bundesregierung before and I doubt<br />this year will be different.","Hannah Carson (30%): The only reason I could see<br />WHO declaring a new Public Health Emergency is for<br />the bird flu. The bird flu is currently spreading<br />among chickens, but has a low risk of transmission<br />to humans. There has been 66 confirmed cases of<br />the bird flu in the United States since 2024, and<br />1 fatality. Although this is a lot higher in the<br />past, most of these cases have been contained to<br />people who farm as an occupation and it doesn't<br />seem to pose a risk to the general public.","Isaac Fleischer (30%): Though many states are<br />beginning to pass legislation to establish a<br />bitcoin reserve, I don’t believe that Congress<br />will pass any legislation on the federal level<br />before the end of the semester. It will take time<br />before the policy gains enough widespread support<br />to be enacted at the national level.","Isaac Fleischer (50%): Though the AFD is projected<br />to win 20% of the seats in the German parliament,<br />the cabinet members are chosen by the elected<br />federal chancellor. This means that the amount of<br />AFD representation may not be reflective of public<br />opinion. On the other hand, AFD popularity has<br />been trending upwards and could very well end up<br />represented in the German cabinet.","Isaac Fleischer (10%): There have only been 8<br />PHEICs ever. Additionally, it usually takes a few<br />months from the WHOs first knowledge of the crisis<br />to its designation of PHEIC. Despite this, there<br />have been instances of a PHEIC being declared<br />mere days after the issue was brought to the WHOs<br />attention. With all things considered, I believe<br />there is a 10% chance that a new PHEIC will be<br />declared during this semester.","Isabella Molina (20%): Although a bill was<br />introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis about bit<br />coin in July 2024 to reserve it nothing has really<br />been down with that bill.Also from my research<br />it looks like Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell<br />has stated that the Federal Reserve cannot hold<br />Bitcoin without congressional authorization. If<br />something were to happen with this bill I highly<br />doubt it would be dealt with by the given date.","Isabella Molina (20%): There are many protests<br />against the AfD, showing the public's huge<br />discontent with this party. This will most<br />likely lead to fewer votes. Additionally, major<br />parties like the Christian Democratic Union have<br />consistently ruled out forming coalitions with<br />the AfD. Due to how far right they are, it seems<br />that many people don't share the same values as<br />that party. Because of this, it is highly unlikely<br />that the AfD will hold any positions in the German<br />Cabinet following the election.","Isabella Molina (20%): The WHO already has an<br />active PHEIC for the mpox outbreak, which was<br />declared in August 2024,I doubt they would declare<br />another for the same issue. If any of these<br />escalate significantly, the WHO intervene if<br />more outbreaks were to occur. But based on recent<br />trends, a new declaration before April 28 doesn’t<br />seem highly likely.","Jacob Weiss (60%): President Trump already has<br />signed executive orders promoting crypto currency.<br />And during his campaign he did promise many<br />things. Trump is a political anomaly if anyone<br />can do something of this magnitude it would be<br />him. I'm not sure if Republicans would enjoy this<br />idea to essentially open up a new type of monetary<br />policy when the national debt is what it is.","Jacob Weiss (0%): The afd is the second highest<br />polling party in Germany. The question though<br />is not will they win seats is will the be in the<br />cabinet. Germany is a proportional constitutional<br />monarchy meaning more than likely a coalition<br />will have to be formed. All other major parties<br />have refused to go in a coalition with the afd<br />so unless they win over half the seats which they<br />won't they won't get cabinet positions.","Jacob Weiss (60%): The world health organization<br />has declared a state emergency nearly every year<br />since 2010. It is impossible to know whether<br />infectious disease will be spread but on world<br />health organization emergency was declared last<br />August. More than likely something will come up.<br />Then he should be contained and least some part of<br />the world.","Jake Garrard (74%): President Donald Trump is<br />pushing the government very quickly into the<br />cryptocurrency market, and a bill has already<br />been introduced into the Senate to establish<br />a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the Federal<br />Government. Donald Trump has also ordered a<br />digital asset working group to explore the<br />implementation of cryptocurrency stockpile in the<br />U.S.. I don't believe it depends on whether or not<br />this prediction comes true, but if it does before<br />April 28th.","Jake Garrard (58%): i believe that the AfD will<br />hold some position in the German cabinet after<br />the election in February, considering that the<br />far-right German politcal party has been gaining<br />more popularity in the past year. A recent<br />migration resolution was passed with the backing<br />of the AfD. However, some of the parties members<br />have been labeled as \"right-wing extremists\" which<br />is a big blow to the parties chances to get a<br />member in cabinet.","Jake Garrard (23%): Public Health Emergencies<br />of International Concern, while they have been<br />ramping up in the past few years, are still not<br />super common events, with only 7 of them being<br />declared since 2009. With the advancement of<br />medical and diagnostic abilities as time goes on,<br />the discovery of new diseases and epidemics is<br />becoming more common, however it is still unlikely<br />for a new PHEIC to be declare within a given 3<br />month period, leaving the probability of this<br />event occurring to be quite low.","Jenny Qiu (30%): Though it is likely for the<br />government to event pass legislation to reserve<br />bitcoin, I think it's unlikely to happen before<br />April 28. The World Liberty Financial platform<br />has announced a strategic reserve, and Trump owns<br />a lot of stake in the platform so he has said<br />that there needs be regulatory framework for \"the<br />future of finance.\" There are many legal issues<br />to be worked around before a strategic bitcoin<br />reserve can be established by the government.","Jenny Qiu (22%): Despite AfD recently having<br />increased support from the people (polls expect<br />them to win 20% of the federal election), their<br />status remains too controversial to the majority<br />(evident of the reaction to Frederich Merz’s<br />recent attempts to utilize AfD votes to pass<br />immigration reform) for them to gain a seat in<br />the cabinet. The necessity to form a coalition<br />with another notable political party due to the<br />multi-party system simply cannot be achieved<br />due to their radical ideology that other parties<br />find difficult to align with. In the future,<br />the probability may increase if their popularity<br />continues to rise and other parties find it<br />rational to ally with AfD in order to reap<br />political benefits.","Jenny Qiu (38%): There have been 8 declared PHEICs<br />in the last 16 years, so the frequency is rather<br />high. However, there is already an ongoing PHEIC<br />for mpox that begun in August 2024, so I do not<br />foresee another one being declared in the next<br />2.5 months. A possible recent disease outbreak<br />that could lead to a PHEIC is the Sudan virus<br />disease (ebolavirus) outbreak in Uganda. There<br />have already been two PHEICs declared over ebola<br />epidemics.","Jerusalem Greenberg (80%): I think it's fairly<br />probable. Not only did six hours ago Donald Trump<br />make an announcement stating he wanted to make<br />a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve through an executive<br />order (many of which have carried through<br />already), but also he's expressed extreme interest<br />in crypto currency in his own personal life, with<br />$Trump and World Liberty Financial. He personally<br />has a lot to gain from allowing crypto currency<br />to flourish in the US, and I trust his selfishness<br />will carry this through.","Jerusalem Greenberg (75%): The AfD has had an<br />unprecedented successful run, something we haven't<br />seen with far-right leaning parties in Germany<br />since the Nazi party. Not only that, but the<br />uptick in Nazi sentiments, as well as the AfD's<br />willingness and blatant enthusiasm for association<br />with Nazi thinking and talking points seem to make<br />a perfect storm for the increasing desire to align<br />with right-wing policies. After their successful<br />run in 2017, the alignment has only gotten more<br />intense.","Jerusalem Greenberg (40%): I don't think so.<br />Though the rate of PHEIC declarations have<br />gotten exponential over the past 25 years, it's<br />mathematically not yet probable that one will<br />happen within that time period. If we're following<br />the track of the exponential growth of PHEICs,<br />the earliest one should be predicted to appear is<br />late 2025 to early 2026. There are multiple active<br />PHEICs as well. I do concede that with vaccination<br />rates in wealthy countries staggering because of<br />right wing ideology that things may get worse,<br />though.","Jessy Lee (40%): Donald Trump has shown<br />a generally supportive attitude toward<br />cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, and has<br />indicated a positive stance on the idea of the<br />U.S. becoming more involved in digital currencies,<br />but I believe the process for congress to pass the<br />legislation will take longer. Given that the U.S.<br />government is currently facing a budget deficit<br />of around $1.8 trillion, it seems difficult to<br />envision Trump borrowing more—especially from<br />China—to invest in a volatile asset like Bitcoin.<br />There are also regulatory challenges to address,<br />including gaining support from conservative<br />agencies that are cautious about high-volatility<br />assets.","Jessy Lee (35%): I believe it is unlikely the<br />AfD will hold any seats in the German Cabinet<br />following the election because of ideological<br />differences, political exclusion, many concerns<br />with their values, and limited influence.<br />The AfD's far-right views, particularly on<br />immigration and nationalism, put them at odds<br />with Germany's mainstream, centrist parties.<br />Major parties like the SPD, CDU, and Greens have<br />ruled out working with the AfD, making coalition<br />agreements impossible.The AfD is also criticized<br />for undermining democratic values, with some<br />factions linked to radical right-wing ideologies.<br />While the AfD has gained regional support, they<br />remain a minority party on the national stage.The<br />party also faces significant protests and public<br />resistance, further isolating them from government<br />roles which is why I believe they are unlikely to<br />hold any seats in the German Cabinet.","Jessy Lee (35%): The WHO declaring a new Public<br />Health Emergency of International Concern can<br />happen but is not frequent. The criteria for the<br />WHO to declare a PHEIC is: serious public health<br />impact, unusual or unexpected event, significant<br />risk of international spread, significant risk<br />of international travel or trade restrictions.<br />The most recent PHEIC is the Clade I Mpox which<br />began in August of 2024 and is concurring. While<br />most cases have been in Democratic Republic of<br />Congo, it is still a Global Emergency. I do not<br />believe WHO will declare a new PHEIC before April<br />28th because there have only been 8 since 2005<br />and there are many times delay from the outbreak<br />to the declaration due to good surveillance via<br />data collection, evaluation, and organization,<br />and the detection of the outbreak and widespread<br />recognition and declaration of it as an<br />international concern.","Joey Khashan (75%): President Trump has made it<br />his mission to establish America as the “Crypto<br />Capital” of the world. Along with backing in<br />several other states, I think that it is almost<br />guaranteed that we will see the establishment<br />of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve within Trump’s<br />presidential term, however, I am unsure if we will<br />see Congress pass the necessary legislation by<br />April 28th, which is why I only have it as a very<br />likely scenario.","Joey Khashan (25%): I believe that it is very<br />unlikely that the AfD will hold a position in the<br />Bundesregierung after the February election. While<br />they are gaining traction, it is still very much<br />taboo to support the far-right party. The other<br />German parties do not seem to view the AfD in a<br />favorable light, therefore I believe that the only<br />way they will have a seat in the Bundesregierung<br />is to win the federal election, which seems<br />unlikely according to Kalshi.","Joey Khashan (25%): There have been 8 PHEICs<br />declared since 2009. The most recent being just<br />last year. Considering that they are usually<br />declared every other year and very rarely have<br />been declared within a year of another, it is<br />highly unlikely that one will be declared this<br />semester. I do think that the HMPV Virus that<br />was infecting many in China may end up being of<br />concern but it may be after this semester if it is<br />declared a PHEIC.","Joshua Kang (10%): A bill has been already<br />introduced in the Senate - it is currently<br />sitting in committee limbo, with the last action<br />on it being in July 2024. Perhaps with Trump’s<br />endorsement, it may be voted on soon - but it<br />seems unlikely. Trump has ordered a new task<br />group to report by July the options for creating<br />a cryptocurrency strategic reserve, which would<br />likely put any concrete creation of the reserve<br />past the prediction deadline of April 28.","Joshua Kang (10%): The AFD has managed to gain<br />significant traction since its beginnings in the<br />early 2010's. It is projected to take the second<br />most amount of seats in the German Bundestag<br />in the upcoming elections. Public sentiments<br />of immigration and dissatisfaction with the EU<br />have fueled it significantly. However, with its<br />controversial, fringe views, and the firm stance<br />of the other parties to not cooperate or work with<br />the AFD, it is unlikely they will find a spot on<br />the German cabinet.","Joshua Kang (10%): There is always the chance<br />of a new disease coming to fruition, prompting<br />the WHO to call a Public Health Emergency. The<br />number one possible issue could be H5N1/bird<br />flu. It has already made its way across the US,<br />killing thousands of wild bird, poultry, and<br />spreading to humans and cattle. However, human to<br />human transmission is still not seen. If it does<br />mutate to do that, that will most likely become<br />an automatic, severe issue with the WHO - however<br />chances are still low of that happening.","Julia Loggins (30%): The German election is<br />supposed to take place February 23, 2025.<br />According to current models, the AfD will finish<br />in second place, winning 20% of the vote. The<br />CDU/CSU still have a lead on 29% of the vote and<br />are projected to win 207 seats. All major parties<br />have ruled out forming an alliance with the AfD<br />making it hard for the AfD to hold any positions.<br />The AfD ultimately will win seats but will not<br />hold any positions in the German Cabinet.","Julia Loggins (16%): The World Health Organization<br />established the Public Health Emergency of<br />International Concern (PHEIC) in 2005. Since 2005,<br />the WHO has declared seven PHEICs in total with<br />the last declaration taking place on August 14,<br />2024 for mpox. According to the data, on average,<br />a PHEIC is declared approximately every 2-3 years<br />making it likely for another one to be released in<br />August 2026-August 2027 not this April.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (15%): I believe the probability<br />of Congress passing legislation establishing a<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by April 28th are quite<br />low. I think that the process is in the very early<br />stages and April 28th is not enough time to lay<br />out the legal framework and everything else that<br />must be put in place for Congress to pass such<br />legislation.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (5%): Currently, the AfD holds<br />no seats in the German Cabinet. I believe it<br />is highly likely for the party to continue this<br />trend following the February 23th election due to<br />polling considerably far behind the CDU, the party<br />with the greatest current support. Additionally,<br />the CDU has refused to form a coalition with the<br />AfD which will make it nearly impossible for the<br />party to hold any seats unless a different party<br />were to break this bloc. However, the odds of this<br />happening so close to the election are slim to<br />none.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (25%): This is very difficult to<br />predict considering how unpredictable a PHEIC can<br />be. Based off of my intuition alone, I would say<br />that this is unlikely to happen. Mpox was the last<br />PHEIC to be declared and it was on the WHO's radar<br />for nearly a year before it earned PHEIC status.<br />Currently, there doesn't seem to be many rising<br />health concerns that would be an international<br />threat by April 28th, but again, the emergence of<br />a new PHEIC could be very unpredictable.","Kelsey Dyar (15%): Donald Trump has stated that<br />he wants the U.S. to be the \"crypto capital of<br />the world\" and has taken many steps to reach that<br />goal including appointing officials who support<br />crypto and rolling back some of Biden's crypto<br />regulations. He also ordered the creation of a<br />digital asset working group, which he has tasked<br />with creating a report addressing the criteria<br />that needs to be met for a federal bitcoin<br />reserve. He has requested the group to turn in<br />this report by July. Because of this, I do not<br />think it is likely for a bitcoin reserve to be<br />created by April 28th.","Kelsey Dyar (20%): A PHEIC is defined in the<br />IHR (2005) as, “an extraordinary event which is<br />determined to constitute a public health risk to<br />other States through the international spread of<br />disease and to potentially require a coordinated<br />international response”. The latest PHEIC the<br />WHO declared was the mpox virus in 2022, which<br />was sexually transmitted and was found in various<br />countries it had never been seen before. I believe<br />that with the avian flu continuing to get worse,<br />it will eventually become a PHEIC. It has already<br />spread to dairy cows and a dairy worker and is<br />projected to get worse. However, I don't think it<br />will progress enough by April 28th to constitute a<br />PHEIC.","Kyle Smith (15%): As a current bitcoin investor<br />I find this to be one of the best outcomes for<br />crypto but i do not see it happening within<br />this time frame. I do see it happening within<br />the distant future but with the process of<br />a bill becoming a law being so extensive, it<br />will most likely take a while. Some states have<br />already shown interest towards the Bitcoin Act<br />of 2024 (S.4912) but the bill still needs to<br />pass legislation. This process is very slow and<br />can take a while. There are too many steps in<br />place that need to happen for the bill to pass<br />legislation before late April.","Kyle Smith (18%): I put the chances of the AFD<br />holding any positions in government pretty low<br />due to the history of the party. There has never<br />been a participation of AFD in German politics.<br />Although they have been close a few times, they<br />have never officially held a federal government<br />position. This may change due to the recent<br />‘five-point plan’, that passed with the backing<br />of the AFD. With cooperation and agreements being<br />made between parties there is less political<br />differentiation between parties then seen in prior<br />years. This may be the case, but the probability<br />of it happening is still slim. Mostly being due<br />to the parties lack of ability to make coalitions<br />with other parties.","Kyle Smith (25%): There are possibilities<br />for there to be a global emergency so we must<br />therefore mitigate the risks of an outbreak.<br />These actions taken to mitigate the flu and other<br />illnesses, will provide further reason why the<br />risk of an emergency is low. The chances of an<br />emergency being announced according to the raw<br />statistics, is about 30%. This percent is then<br />further changed with the current measures taken by<br />countries around the world. Therefore, the percent<br />will decrease, in my opinion, by around 5-10%.<br />Thus, my probability of an emergency announced by<br />the organization to be around 25%.","Lawton Smith (15%): As of February 14, 2025, the<br />likelihood of Congress passing legislation to<br />establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by April<br />28 appears low. While there is growing interest<br />in Bitcoin at both federal and state levels,<br />significant legislative hurdles remain. That<br />hurdle mainly seems to be time at this point. With<br />how busy and active this administration has been ,<br />we will see.","Lawton Smith (7%): Based on the current political<br />landscape and party stances, the likelihood of the<br />AfD holding any positions in the German Cabinet<br />after the February 2025 election is extremely<br />low. I would estimate that it is less than 10%<br />chance of the AfD being part of the government.<br />Most mainstream parties have expressed a hard<br />reluctance to support the Afd.","Lawton Smith (20%): As of February 12, 2025, the<br />WHO has declared eight Public Health Emergencies<br />of International Concern (PHEIC) since 2007, with<br />the most recent being the mpox outbreak in August<br />2024.Historically, PHEIC declarations have been<br />infrequent, occurring approximately once every<br />two to three years. However, the emergence of new<br />pathogens, resurgence of existing diseases, or<br />other health threats could prompt a declaration<br />at any time. But since the most recent one was<br />back in August, I do think it is unlikely we see<br />another one.","Levi Thomas (10%): The current crypto czar David<br />Sacks has made public statements discussing how<br />the Federal Government was in the beginning stages<br />of research for developing a strategic bitcoin<br />reserve. He also made statements that prioritized<br />the development of rules and regulations for<br />crypto over the development of a reserve.<br />Furthermore, all current legislation proposing<br />a strategic reserve lacks bipartisan support and<br />will likely fall flat given the slim majorities in<br />both the House and Senate.","Levi Thomas (30%): All parties in the German<br />parliament (Bundestag) have stated that they will<br />not be willing to cooperate with the AfD if they<br />win seats in parliament as they are predicted to<br />do. This means that the federal chancellor for<br />Germany’s parliament will likely get voted in by<br />a coalition that excludes the AfD if all parties<br />stay true to their word and if the AfD does not<br />greatly exceed their expected seat victories. A<br />chancellor selected by a coalition void of the AfD<br />will likely avoid AfD party members from acquiring<br />any cabinet positions after the election.","Lillie Puhrmann (20%): Congress is twenty percent<br />likely to construct a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve<br />by April 28, 2025. Donald Trump supports Bitcoin<br />efforts like the BITCOIN Act of 2024. However,<br />Federal Reserve officials and senators who<br />distrust Bitcoin's role in national reserves are<br />opposing the plan. Lawmaking takes a long time,<br />and instability and confusing regulations remain<br />significant obstacles. Even while crypto-friendly<br />policies are growing more popular, new legislation<br />is unlikely in the future months. If political<br />support grows, it might happen.","Lillie Puhrmann (5%): The AfD has almost no<br />chance of being part of the German Cabinet because<br />they are politically isolated. All the major<br />parties are unwilling to work with them, and<br />the coalition system in Germany makes it crucial<br />to form partnerships. Also, the examination<br />of intelligence regarding extremism makes it<br />harder for them to get involved in the federal<br />government.","Lillie Puhrmann (12%): The WHO is less than likely<br />to proclaim a new PHEIC before April 28, 2025.<br />The WHO monitors global health hazards, but no<br />major diseases or outbreaks indicate a declaration<br />is imminent. However, a quick development in a<br />new infectious illness or hazard could change<br />this. There are no visible warning indicators,<br />unlike in the past when PHEICs were called due<br />to rapid developments. Therefore, while unlikely,<br />it's possible. Global monitoring is crucial for<br />preventing hazards from becoming emergencies.","Mabry Cartwright (40%): I believe that Congress<br />will eventually pass legislation establishing a<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, but I do not believe<br />that it will happen by April 28. One of President<br />Trump’s first actions was putting together a task<br />force designed to create policies for digital<br />assets. An article by Cointelegraph states that<br />his team is working towards legislation, but they<br />have six months to put together a plan for this,<br />so I do not see this action happening before<br />April. We might see this at the state level, like<br />in Texas, but not nationally.","Mabry Cartwright (75%): I placed the percentage at<br />75% because the AfD party has been on the rise. I<br />do not know much about German politics, but many<br />different articles talked about how it is “not<br />taboo” to support this party after recent events.<br />Polymarket also placed the probability that the<br />AfD would hold the second most seats at 92%.","Mabry Cartwright (30%): I am placing the<br />probability that the WHO will declare a PHEIC<br />before April 28th at 30%. I do not see any<br />impending threats, but the Bird Flu has been on<br />a steady rise. However, there are a low number<br />of human cases and the current strand is not<br />considered to be highly contagious between humans.<br />It took many more cases for the WHO to declare<br />Covid-19 a PHEIC, so I believe the slow rise will<br />not result in a PHEIC before April.","Margaret Pope (34%): The AfD has gained a<br />significant amount of popularity since the<br />downfall of Germany's government. The Social<br />Democratic Party of Germany was extremely<br />unpopular, and their failure has given rise to<br />many new German political parties. The election<br />during late February will be dependent up on the<br />amount of smaller parties who win; however, the<br />polls have showed clearly that Friedrich Merz of<br />the Christian Democrat Party will win chancellor.<br />Due to his party's distaste for AfD, I find it<br />less likely that AfD will hold a cabinet position.","Margaret Pope (20%): For the World Health<br />Organization to declare a public health emergency<br />of international concern, there must be a health<br />concern that \"carries implications for public<br />health beyond the affected States' national border<br />and may require immediate international concern.\"<br />Currently, H5N1, or bird flu, is a strong<br />contender for an international public health<br />concern, but due to its low risk, I do not think<br />it will pass the threshold to be considered an<br />emergency. I find it highly unlikely the WHO will<br />officially declare a PHEIC before April 28.","Maston Corn (13%): The Bitcoin Act of 2024 is<br />still in the early stages of the legislative<br />process as it was referred to the Committee on<br />Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. It was first<br />introduced into Senate on July 31, 2024, and still<br />has to go through committee review, potential<br />amendments, and then the House and the Senate.<br />There also seems to be other bills that are a<br />priority for Congress before this legislation.","Maston Corn (10%): There are 17 positions within<br />the German Cabinet that will be available in the<br />2025 elections and the AfD is predicted to not<br />win any of them. They are expected to receive<br />anywhere between 20-25% of the votes and receive<br />around 154 seats of the total 735 members which is<br />a slight increase from previous years and reflect<br />the growth in support that the party is receiving,<br />however, the AfD is always politically isolated<br />from the rest of the parliament due to the parties<br />far-right extremism. All of the other parties in<br />the German parliament have ruled out working with<br />the AfD and when the cabinet positions are chosen<br />by the parliament, it is unlikely that the AfD<br />will hold any positions.","Maston Corn (15%): The Who has declared a Public<br />Health Emergency of International Concern a<br />total of 8 times since the International Health<br />Regulations were revised in 2005. during this<br />time, these PHEIC have rarely overlapped during<br />the same years. In 2024, the WHO announced a<br />PHEIC because of the Monkeypox outbreak in the<br />Democratic Republic of Congo and other African<br />countries. It is very unlikely that another will<br />be announced unless there is a large outbreak<br />between now and April 28th.","Meera Srinivasan (20%): Though the idea of a<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the federal level has<br />been floated various times, it seems unlikely to<br />me that Congress would be able to work together<br />long enough to pass legislation concerning<br />this in particular, given the narrow majorities<br />that Republicans have in both chambers. This is<br />further complicated by intra-party divides, which<br />I believe will be a deciding factor in whether<br />a potential bill regarding a SBR is to succeed.<br />However, I expect it is possible that I may be<br />underestimating support for a federal SBR among<br />members of Congress, as well as their efficiency<br />in passing legislation.","Meera Srinivasan (45%): The AfD has been seeing<br />increasing electoral success in recent elections,<br />tapping into the anti-migration sentiment and<br />other ideological concerns of a significant<br />portion of Germans. I believe it would be possible<br />for the President to appoint an AfD member to<br />the Cabinet, especially since the leader of the<br />center-right Christian Democratic Union, Friedrich<br />Merz, has shown an openness to working with the<br />far-right that has not been shown by the center<br />coalition in decades—since the Nazi era, to be<br />exact. While this has caused much controversy<br />within the coalitions, I believe that it is still<br />more likely than not that the AfD will not hold<br />any cabinet positions—but by a very slim margin.<br />Germans themselves were shocked at their recent<br />electoral gains, so I think it is absolutely<br />possible that I could also be shocked as well by<br />the true outcome.","Meera Srinivasan (20%): Though I believe it is<br />possible that the WHO will declare a new public<br />health emergency of international concern, I do<br />not think it is very likely. Apart from countries<br />like the US, where the current leadership<br />has pulled out of the WHO, I believe that a<br />significant portion of the countries around the<br />world learned many lessons from the Covid-19<br />pandemic that they will continue to consider when<br />addressing public health issues. Preparedness has<br />improved in many countries due the pandemic, but<br />gaps still exist.","Mia Pisani (17%): Fifteen states have begun<br />legislative efforts to incorporate Bitcoin into<br />their financial plans. No states have passed<br />legislation forming a Bitcoin Reserve. At the<br />national level, President Trump has advocated<br />for a crypto reserve, however the Federal Reserve<br />Chair has expressed that the U.S. Central Bank<br />has no interest in crypto involvement. The Bitcoin<br />Act was introduced in July 2024. It has been<br />read twice by the Senate is being reviewed by<br />the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs<br />Committee. It was referred there July 31, 2024,<br />and there have been no updates since. I feel that<br />there are more pressing issues in Congress, as<br />well as pushback from the Fed, leading the bill<br />to be placed on the backburner This leads me<br />to believe there is a low chance of a Strategic<br />Bitcoin Reserve being established by Congress<br />before April 28th.","Mia Pisani (38%): The AfD, or the Alternative<br />for Germany party, is a heavily right-wing party<br />in Germany. It was founded in 2013. The AfD is<br />known for their strict immigration policies,<br />unwillingness to admit climate change is man-made,<br />and anti-Islamic policies. In June 2024, the<br />AfD received 15.9% of the vote in the European<br />elections. However, prior to the election, two<br />AfD candidates were under investigation for<br />alleged bribery from Russia. In September of<br />2024, the AfD achieved a blocking minority in<br />several states. It also became the strongest<br />party in a state election for the first time. The<br />Bundesregierung is composed of the Chancellor and<br />the Federal Ministers. The Chancellor is elected<br />by the Bundestag, then may appoint the Federal<br />Ministers. Friedrich Merz is predicted to become<br />the next Chancellor, per Politico, but the AfD<br />is polling in second place. Merz is also taking<br />on a anti-immigration stance, similar to that<br />of the AfD party. However, there are attempts to<br />ban the AfD, arguing it is an anti-constitutional<br />party. The party has grown in support, but I<br />find it unlikely it will hold a position in the<br />Bundesregierung.","Mia Pisani (13%): The World Health Organization<br />describes a Public Health Emergency of<br />International Concern as \"an extraordinary event<br />which is determined to constitute a public health<br />risk to other States through the international<br />spread of disease and to potentially require a<br />coordinated international response.\" There have<br />been 8 declarations of such since 2005, the<br />most recent being monkey pox in August 2024.<br />There are two strains of monkeypox that led to<br />the declaration of a PHEIC, although there are<br />four strains total. There are several illnesses<br />that are automatically considered PHEICs, and<br />therefore do not require a declaration, including<br />any new strain of influenza, SARS, smallpox,<br />and wild type poliomyelitis. However, PHEICs are<br />not limited to illnesses; it may also include<br />exposure to chemicals or radioactive material. Per<br />specialists, a pandemic is likely to occur due to<br />a variety of reasons, including climate change,<br />but we are unable to say exactly when. I find it<br />unlikely a new virus would begin prior to April<br />28th, but a strain of a preexisting virus may<br />warrant a declaration of a PHEIC.","Milan Yadav (12%): While 15 states (on both sides<br />of the aisle) have passed legislation on this,<br />having a federal Bitcoin reserve can be volatile<br />and must go through many obstacles. There exists<br />a Senate bill that directly addresses this, but<br />it is only in its Intro phase and the likelihood<br />of it being passed by both chambers of Congress<br />in just 2.5 months is very unlikely. The 118th<br />Congress (which ended a few weeks ago) was<br />infamous for being history's least-productive<br />Congress in terms of passing bills in both<br />chambers, and although the 119th will be better<br />with this (since one party controls essentially<br />all levels) it will not be monumentally better.","Milan Yadav (5%): As of February 10, , the<br />German federal election is scheduled for February<br />23. Recent polls indicate that the Alternative<br />for Germany (AfD) is projected to secure<br />approximately 20% of the vote, positioning them<br />as the second-largest party in the Bundestag.<br />Despite this anticipated strong performance, all<br />major parties, including the leading Christian<br />Democratic Union (CDU/CSU), have ruled out forming<br />a coalition with the AfD due to its far-right<br />positions.","Milan Yadav (25%): As of today around the world,<br />there are only 2 PHEICs: polio and monkeypox. In<br />places like Africa, east Asia, and South America,<br />major diseases exist. Currently, only a few<br />diseases pose a potential international threat<br />(cholera, avian flu, and Marburg virus). To be a<br />PHEIC, a disease has to be an international threat<br />due to mass death, have a lack of countermeasures,<br />be rapidly spread, and have a major travel impact.<br />the WHO Emergency Committee meets every 3 months<br />to discuss this, and they next meet April 16 this<br />year. As of now, there are no diseases that pose<br />a significant int'l risk. However, the bird flu<br />disease (H5N1) is currently not transmissible from<br />human-to-human, but if it's mutated then it can do<br />this. This makes it have a major potential to be<br />an int'l concern. The UK for example has already<br />bought 5 million doses of bird flu's vaccine in<br />preparation for a possible outbreak.","Nathaniel Long (59%): In 2024, Congress<br />established the Bitcoin Act, which does establish<br />a psuedo-bitcoin reserve. While Congress has<br />already created this reserve, I believe it<br />slightly likely that Congress will pass new<br />legislation regarding it, especially due to the<br />connections Elon Musk has to both cryptocurrency<br />and Donald Trump.","Nathaniel Long (44%): According to DW.com, the<br />Alternative for Germany (AfD), garnered very<br />split popularity among the German public in<br />recent polls. 49% of those polled said it would be<br />unacceptable to pass a law with AfD votes, while<br />44% said it was acceptable. In addition, 66% of<br />those polled rejected the idea of including the<br />AfD when forming a government. It therefore seems<br />that there is a slightly lower chance of the AfD<br />holding positions in the German government after<br />the upcoming elections, though the margin is very<br />slim.","Nathaniel Long (19%): As explained in my briefing,<br />it is most likely that a PHEIC will be declared as<br />a result of a major virus, as all previous PHEICs<br />have been so. Of the major viruses circulating<br />in the current sphere, none pose a significant<br />or new threat to the health of the world. (These<br />viruses include Bird Flu, Covid-19, Mpox, etc).<br />Much of the PHEIC scare is caused by mass media<br />declarations of the 'disease of the year' and the<br />prevalence of Bird Flu in the dairy and poultry<br />industries.","Niomi Nurse (95%): It is highly likely that<br />Bitcoin will become established through Congress<br />passing legislation. While Campaigning, Trump<br />has expressed several time that he fully intends<br />to legitimize Bitcoin in the U.S. and eventually<br />the global market. Republican lawmakers are also<br />pushing for Bitcoin to become established. Because<br />Congress is predominantly Republican, I believe it<br />to be likely that if Trump wants to pass the bill<br />to Legitimize Bitcoin, it will likely happen.","Niomi Nurse (20%): There is said to be no<br />cooperation with the far right regime of Germany<br />in the near future. The German government wishes<br />to do everything possible to keep those negative<br />influences at bay. The country has a deep<br />history with far right politics taking over the<br />government, and is committed to not repeating<br />the same cycles. For this reason I think it is<br />unlikely that the cabinet will administer anyone<br />new.","Niomi Nurse (80%): I believe it is very likely<br />that the WHO will declare a new Public Health<br />Emergency of the Bird Flu Virus by April 28.<br />Several cases of bird fly have been discovered<br />in the past few weeks. The bird flu virus is<br />spreading rapidly and is airborne. The virus has<br />been spreading around farm animals like chickens<br />and cows, and birds. According to the CDC and<br />WHO, this virus is mutating at alarming rates<br />amongst humans. Human to human transfer of the<br />bird flu can be enough to initiate a domestic or<br />international Public Health Emergency.","Pablo Martinez (15%): All major German parties,<br />including the CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens, and FDP,<br />have repeatedly ruled out forming a coalition<br />with the AfD due to its far-right policies<br />and controversial positions. Even in regional<br />governments, where the AfD has gained influence,<br />it remains largely isolated. The only scenario<br />where the AfD could gain influence would be if<br />a major political crisis forces CDU/CSU to break<br />their pledge and cooperate with them—something<br />that seems highly unlikely given recent political<br />dynamics.","Pablo Martinez (10%): The last declared who<br />emergency was August 14th 2024 with the breakout<br />of Mpox. Before this , it was Covid 19 which<br />started in 2020. It took 4 years for who to<br />declare an emergency. In this time period we have<br />seen many dangers of disease come and go but it<br />seems very uncommon that who will declare any of<br />these as an emergency. It seems highly unlikely a<br />new disease will come up especially before April<br />28th but it’s not entirely impossible.","Quintin Gallardo (25%): At its current state<br />state It seems unlikely that Congress will pass<br />any legislation establishing a strategic bitcoin<br />reserve in the United States in the next few<br />months. This is because there is A definitive lack<br />in regards to time for to process through as well<br />as support. While many may advocate for it there<br />is a lack in those who do.","Quintin Gallardo (70%): With support for the<br />AFD, a support for the anti-immigration far right<br />party, increasing, there is a decreasing taboo<br />over the selection of members of this party in<br />parliament. In Europe and other more developed<br />countries in recent years, There has been a trend<br />of selecting officials based on anti-immigration<br />policies as we can see in the United Kingdom<br />as well as the United States. These follow of<br />elevated immigration, which Germany has seen<br />following its recent take in policy of refugees.","Quintin Gallardo (10%): In regards to an<br />additional declaration of a Public health<br />emergency, I think there is a low likelihood that<br />the WHO does this on the basis of how rarely it<br />occurs. Since Covid, the only declarations have<br />been 2 strains of mpox Which both were given the<br />distinction in warmer months. Since we are only<br />looking till April 28, I find this to be variable<br />in the likelihood as well.","Rebecca Mcadam (40%): Since Trump has pushed the<br />idea of establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve<br />in his speeches, I think there is a possibility<br />that the bill introduced in July may pass.<br />However, I think this will be prevented from<br />happening too soon given the volatile nature of<br />bitcoin and uncertainty about the future of it,<br />since it is relatively new.","Rebecca Mcadam (25%): While the AfD is increasing<br />in size and power across Germany, more popular<br />parties refuse to form coalitions with the party.<br />As a result, I think it is unlikely that the AfD<br />will hold seats in the cabinet. However, I do<br />think more seats in the Bundestag will be held by<br />AfD members than previously.","Rebecca Mcadam (40%): I think there is not a<br />disease currently circulating globally that<br />would be a high enough risk for the World Health<br />Organization to need to declare a Public Health<br />Emergency of International Concern. The bird<br />flu is the highest contender, but it is not<br />transmissible between humans, which leads me<br />to believe it will not be the cause of a PHEIC<br />declaration.","Riley Batz (25%): During his election campaign in<br />2024, President Donald Trump pledged to establish<br />a Bitcoin Reserve, sparking ongoing speculation<br />about if and when the U.S. government might<br />formally add Bitcoin to its asset holdings. Since<br />then, the conversation around a federally backed<br />Bitcoin Reserve has gained traction, particularly<br />as some states have adopted more crypto-friendly<br />policies. This seems like a bipartisan issue,<br />as while discussions at the federal level are in<br />their early stages, 15 states have already begun<br />legislative efforts to incorporate bitcoin into<br />their financial strategies- including Republican<br />states like Alabama and Democrat states like<br />Massachusetts. On a federal level, there have<br />been no definitive actions taken so far. Last<br />year Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced<br />the BITCOIN Act, which seeks to establish a<br />national Bitcoin reserve. It has not been passed.<br />Additionally, On Feb. 4, newly appointed crypto<br />czar David Sacks said in a press conference that<br />the bicameral crypto working group is \"looking<br />into\" a strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR) . Overall,<br />though the idea is building traction, I don't<br />believe any bill will be passed by April 28th. It<br />is too fast a timeline to get congress to agree<br />and pass a bill.","Riley Batz (30%): A federal election will be held<br />in Germany on 23 February 2025 to elect the 630<br />members of the 21st Bundestag. AfD is a far right<br />party, not predicted to win the election, but<br />Recent polls indicate the AfD is likely to secure<br />second place in the election, with 21 percent of<br />the vote – 10 points behind the CDU and its sister<br />party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). CDU<br />leader Friedrich Merz – tipped to become Germany’s<br />new chancellor – proposed a motion on tougher<br />migration rules, known as the five-point plan,<br />that passed with the backing of the AfD. This<br />breaks tradition of receiving any support from the<br />far right party. Though this out of the ordinary<br />support may indicate the strong possibility that<br />the AfD will hold a position, Merz seems hesistant<br />towards the party, and expressed that he simply<br />needed their support to pass the plan. Merz<br />stated that \"a decision was not wrong just because<br />the \"wrong people\" supported it.\" Given Merz is<br />likely to be the next German chancellor, and he<br />is calling members of the AfD the \"wrong people\",<br />I do not foresee a high probability for Merz to<br />select a AfD to be a member of the cabinet.","Riley Batz (30%): WHO has determined a public<br />health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)<br />eight times since 2005: H1N1 in 2009, poliovirus<br />in 2014, Ebola virus in 2014 and 2019, Zika virus<br />in 2016, COVID-19 in 2020, and mpox in 2022 and<br />2024. This is 40% of the years since the term's<br />beginning. The recommendations are temporary<br />and require reviews every three months, the last<br />was made in August 2024. However, upon further<br />research, there is nothing to indicate that<br />there will be a PHEIC anytime soon, though it<br />could happen randomly (hence the 30% instead of<br />10%). When searching \"emerging diseases\", there<br />is no article on the WHO website that is in the<br />date range of the past 6-12 months. Covid-19,<br />for example, was declared a PHEIC on Jan 30,<br />2020. This is after the first cases appeared in<br />Nov-December 2019. Unless a new disease emerges<br />within the next few weeks, I don't believe there<br />is a high chance for a PHEIC.","Ruby Douglas (35%): I have a strong feeling that<br />Trump’s return to the White House will advocate<br />for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. For years,<br />people have advocated for the Bitcoin reserve for<br />the purpose that it could hold its own against<br />inflation and currency devaluation. Some US states<br />have gotten particularly serious about Bitcoin<br />Reserves since Trump has taken office and they are<br />looking to consider it as part of their investment<br />strategy. If the US were to fully back up the SBR<br />it would mean humongous growth for Bitcoin and<br />would increase the trust that US citizens put in<br />Bitcoin as a whole. I think that because of the<br />fact that Trump is coming into office eager and<br />ready to test the limits, we can see a probability<br />of this happening.","Ruby Douglas (20%): Recent tensions in parliament<br />will likely boost the far right in terms of the<br />party's legitimacy and visibility. Until recently,<br />voting for the AfD was considered a wasted vote;<br />however, now the party attracts many more voters<br />and has the possibility of being represented in<br />the German parliament. Although they have gained<br />traction and have a higher number of supporters<br />now in comparison to the past, it is very<br />difficult to foresee them holding any significant<br />positions in the cabinet before April unless<br />there's a significant shift in German politics.<br />I could see them continuing to gain traction, yet<br />I think it is too short term for them to hold a<br />position.","Ruby Douglas (10%): There have been several<br />notable declarations of PHEICS in the past couple<br />of decades, all of which are decided based on the<br />severity of public health impact, their unusual<br />or unexpected nature, or the cross-border spread<br />potential. Whil it is difficult to predict when<br />the next public health emergency might be, we have<br />larned from the COVID-19 pandemic how to better<br />prepare our systems and respond to future threats<br />more quickly. While it seems normal to worry about<br />things such as th bird flu and other diseases that<br />are emerging at a quick pace, I don't think we<br />need to worry about a new public health outbreak<br />anytime soon.","Sarah Joyce (15%): I think Congress passing<br />legislation to establish a Bitcoin Reserve this<br />early into the year is pretty unlikely. I think<br />that it will take some time to establish a legal<br />framework, although the Trump administration has<br />expressed it as a top priority. Also, Polymarket<br />gives it an 11% chance in the first 100 days, and<br />that seems like it would be an accurate indication<br />of how those who invest in cryptocurrency feel<br />about the possibility of a Bitcoin Reserve.","Sarah Joyce (10%): I find it very unlikely that<br />AfD will hold any positions in the German Cabinet.<br />It is pretty much expected that the CDU/CSU<br />coalition will win, but it remains uncertain who<br />they will also form a coalition with to get the<br />majority. However, they have completely ruled<br />out AfD. Some are skeptical because CDU recently<br />worked with AfD on anti-immigration legislation,<br />but I think this is vastly different from forming<br />a formal coalition with them, so I still think it<br />would be unlikely.","Sarah Joyce (25%): It seems unlikely that the WHO<br />will declare a new PHEIC. They have only declared<br />7 since 2009, and the criteria seems to be pretty<br />strict to what makes them declare one. The current<br />viral diseases (all the past PHEIC have been<br />viral) seem to be closely monitored to where I<br />think they will be unlikely to become a PHEIC.<br />That being said, a disease could pop up out of<br />nowhere unexpectedly, as the WHO reports that new<br />diseases are emerging at an unprecedented rate, so<br />I am not completely confident.","Senait Pirani (30%): It is unlikely that Congress<br />will pass legislation establishing a Strategic<br />Bitcoin Reserve by April 28. While there is<br />growing interest in Bitcoin at both federal and<br />state levels, the legislative process is slow,<br />and the proposed BITCOIN Act remains in committee.<br />However, increasing state-level initiatives<br />and political discussions around Bitcoin could<br />influence future federal policies.","Senait Pirani (68%): I think there is a good<br />probability that a member of the AfD will be<br />tapped to hold a cabinet position in Germany.<br />The front-runner for Chancellor, Friedrich<br />Merz, recently showed he was willing to leverage<br />the AfD's support to pass a motion on tougher<br />migration rules, although it was ultimately struck<br />down. This showed the presumed future chancellor's<br />willingness to ally with the far-right group,<br />and with cabinet positions being appointed by the<br />president at the suggestion of the chancellor, and<br />no confirmation or election needed, I think there<br />is a good chance at least one member of the AfD<br />will clinch a cabinet position.","Senait Pirani (35%): There’s a fairly low chance<br />the WHO will declare a Public Health Emergency of<br />International Concern (PHEIC) for bird flu before<br />April 28. The recent human case in Nevada, linked<br />to a new strain (D1.1) spreading in dairy cattle,<br />raises concerns. While human-to-human transmission<br />remains unlikely, increased spread among mammals<br />could push the WHO to act. If more human cases<br />emerge or mutations occur, a PHEIC declaration<br />becomes more likely.","Sreya Pandyaram (32%): While the creation of a<br />Strategic Bitcoin Reserve seems likely, given the<br />strong support from several states and leaders<br />who are pushing the initiative forward, the<br />chances of it happening before April 28th are<br />low. Establishing such a reserve takes time, and<br />it may be more realistic for it to materialize by<br />mid-2025. Therefore the chances of a federal level<br />strategic reserve may take a long time. Ans since<br />this is a complex bill it may take longer than a<br />few months as opposed to a more simple bill.","Sreya Pandyaram (30%): Given that the AfD<br />(Alternative for Germany) has not been part of<br />the government for a long time and holds extreme<br />views that most mainstream parties want to<br />distance themselves from, it's highly unlikely<br />that the party will hold any positions in the<br />German Cabinet after February's election. However,<br />with some of the issues the AfD supports gaining<br />more attention, and the CDU (Christian Democratic<br />Union) signaling openness to supporting certain<br />AfD-related policies, it is clear that the party's<br />influence is growing. While they may not directly<br />join the government, the AfD's prominence and<br />potential to shape certain political discussions<br />could increase, particularly if its policies are<br />adopted by other parties in some form","Sreya Pandyaram (16%): The likelihood of the WHO<br />declaring a public health emergency before April<br />28 is relatively low. However, this could change<br />at any time, as major events such as natural<br />disasters or international travel can trigger<br />public health emergencies. After researching the<br />topic, it's clear that there is no specific month<br />more likely for such announcements; instead,<br />certain periods, like flu season, tend to see<br />higher levels of monitoring. With climate change<br />and also recent cases of the flu and stomach bug,<br />there might be an increase in cases but a public<br />health emergency is still not certain.","Teya Hagy (20%): I do not think that congress will<br />pass legislation by April 28th. There is currently<br />no legislation that would lead to a strategic<br />bitcoin reserve, so far. Bitcoin technology is<br />still being worked on and is still improving, and<br />they are mostly working on how to prevent illegal<br />activities, so I do not believe that there will be<br />any legislation being passed any time soon.","Teya Hagy (15%): I do not think that the AfD<br />will hold any positions in the German Cabinet<br />because the major parties like The Christian<br />Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party<br />have all explicitly said that they would not form<br />a coalition with the AfD at a federal level. This<br />would make it highly unlikely for this to happen.","Thomas Smith (64%): I find it more likely than not<br />that a federal bitcoin reserve is started. Trumps<br />administration seems more open to crypto currency<br />exchange than any other modern administration.<br />I think it’s more likely as well given musk’s<br />enthusiasm on the idea and the fact that several<br />states have pending legislation making their own<br />statewide reserve.","Thomas Smith (25%): Given that the AfD are lagging<br />behind in the polls and can't seem to gather<br />much of their momentum they had I find it hard<br />to believe their will be any members of the AfD<br />appointed to the chancellors cabinet. The CDU/CSU<br />coalition that leads the polls by significant<br />margins have made it clear that they will never<br />appoint an individual from the AfD to serve at the<br />federal level.","Thomas Smith (15%): The current bird flu outbreak<br />has the highest chance of being declared a PHIEC<br />but I am doubtful this will happen before the<br />28th of April. PHIEC are not something the WHO<br />takes lightly in declaring so the current bird<br />flu outbreak would have to see some major changes<br />before being considered.","Tiyanah Rowtham (12%): The Bitcoin Act of 2024<br />was introduced on July 31, 2024 to the Senate. It<br />is under the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs<br />Committee. The committee has no record of passed<br />hearings nor any hearings on the schedule. Since<br />the bill is still in the “introduction” stage, I<br />assume there is a very low chance that there will<br />be legislation passed to establish a Strategic<br />Bitcoin Reserve.","Tiyanah Rowtham (10%): In my opinion , the<br />Alternative for America (AFD) has approximately<br />a 33% chance to hold any positions in the German<br />Cabinet which will be elected on February 28. The<br />“firewall” policy, upheld by major parties, refuse<br />to cooperate with the AFD, greatly affecting their<br />chances of having any cabinet seats. On the other<br />hand, Germany’s Chancellor took a major political<br />risk by relying on the AFD to deliver a majority<br />in parliament.","Tiyanah Rowtham (22%): The question asked was<br />whether the WHO would declare a ‘new’ public<br />health concern so I am unsure whether COVID-19<br />would be considered as new. Also, the WHO uses a<br />high standard to determine whether something is a<br />PHEIC. Given the strict PHEIC guidelines and the<br />low probability of a declaration before April 28,<br />I estimate a 22% chance of this occurring. On the<br />other hand, some experts may argue that the rise<br />in H5N1 cases increases the likelihood that WHO<br />would declare a PHEIC before April 28.","Townsend Turner (25%): The current proposal is<br />the BITCOIN Act, and while it has some traction<br />across the aisle in both houses of Congress, the<br />last time it was brought before committee, they<br />refused to even vote on it. Now, it seems likely<br />that it might pass at some point, but the process<br />takes time and so a deadline of April 28 seems<br />ambitious.","Townsend Turner (27%): Odds are very low that the<br />AfD wins the chancellorship, which means their<br />only option for the cabinet is as a minister.<br />Ministers are appointed by the President based<br />on nominations from the chancellor. The current<br />frontrunner in the election has already ruled<br />out a partnership between himself and the AfD,<br />and coupling that with the fact that the current<br />President is a member of the SPD party and<br />therefore holds the opposite views of the AfD, an<br />appointment to the cabinet from the AfD has low<br />odds. However, there are things that are happening<br />that might surprise anyone, and there are 16<br />cabinet positions…","Townsend Turner (12%): The odds of another PHEIC<br />being declared in the next two and a half months<br />are low. For one, it takes some time before<br />something is declared a PHEIC. COVID-19 was first<br />discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019,<br />but it took almost two months until the 30th of<br />January 2020 for it to receive the PHEIC label.<br />Therefore, the real question is less of “Will<br />there be a PHEIC before April 28th?” and more of<br />“Will a potential global health threat present<br />itself in time to be declared a PHEIC before April<br />28th?” In other words, if COVID-19 is any clue,<br />will a potential global health threat become known<br />before the end of February? That gives less than<br />three weeks for something to appear on the global<br />stage, and since there are not any current obvious<br />candidates for a PHEIC, those odds are quite low.","Tristan Thompson (43%): While it is clear<br />that President Trump has made it a priority to<br />increase the Federal Government’s involvement in<br />cryptocurrency, his plan for the Fed to purchase<br />stockpiles of Bitcoin is one that I think will<br />take a substantial amount of time to pass through<br />congress as it is such a radical change.","Tristan Thompson (25%): Predicting things such<br />as public health emergencies is difficult because<br />the development is often very rapid. The first<br />case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Wuhan, China in<br />December of 2019, but it was not deemed a public<br />health emergency until roughly mid-January of<br />2020. The only notable concern recently has been<br />the spread of Monkeypox, but there has been little<br />development on the disease since last year. I find<br />it unlikely for this to occur within the given<br />window of time based on current information.","Vangeli Tsiaras (20%): The centre-right German<br />CDU/CSU coalition parties are currently ahead in<br />German election polls. CDU/CSU leader Friedrich<br />Merz has stated that if the party is victorious<br />that there will be no collaboration with the AfD<br />on the account of their Eurosceptism, anti-Nato<br />sentiment, and other various extreme right wing<br />views.","Vangeli Tsiaras (30%): I think that it is unlikely<br />the WHO will issue a new PHEIC before April 28th.<br />Monkeypox has recently taken over international<br />news regarding its outbreak and severity, to which<br />the WHO issued another PHEIC on August 14 2024.<br />The WHO will likely issue another PHEIC sometime<br />this year regarding monkeypox or another possible<br />disease outbreak but I predict it will come later<br />than April 28th.","Wyatt Dasher (5%): The odds on betting markets are<br />very low for it to happen through th entire year.<br />If trump is going to add bitcoin I don't think<br />it will be this early on during his presidency.<br />I just see it being very low. He seems to be busy<br />and focusing on his main running points. Boarder<br />and other issues seem to be taking priority.","Wyatt Dasher (40%): Honestly I am not sure how<br />they are going to do. All my research says that<br />it's unlikely but it also may happen. With Elon<br />musk backing the AfD party is really is a wild<br />card. There is also the fact that the current<br />chancellor had a vote of no confidence. All and<br />all I am honestly not sure.","Wyatt Dasher (40%): Bird flu seems to be turning<br />around and with that I believe that they will not<br />change the emergency status. The reason which my<br />estimate is high is because of my life experience.<br />I fear that virus are more common and spreading<br />faster. We also have \"Covid Fear\" where we act<br />like every new sickness is going to be as big and<br />powerful as covid was.","Wyatt Stevenson (32%): There is a lot to consider<br />when thinking about legislation on Bitcoin. First<br />and foremost, the legislative process takes time<br />to the point where it might be difficult for<br />the bill to be passed before then. Along with<br />the legislative process, you must consider both<br />parties and the lack of consensus. Part of the<br />reason there might be some hesitation to pass<br />this bill is because there were other priorities<br />that the current administration would cover first,<br />despite having interest in expanding bitcoin.","Wyatt Stevenson (30%): It will be pretty difficult<br />for Afd to hold any positions in the German<br />Cabinet after the February election because of<br />their past extreme views. While establishing their<br />views publically and with the elections coming<br />up soon, it is going to be difficult for Afd to<br />govern Germany. Currently, they are projected to<br />be in second place behind the Christian Democratic<br />Union by 10 point voting.","Wyatt Stevenson (30%): There has not been many<br />declarations for a new PHEIC over the past couple<br />of decades. There have been a couple of diseases<br />that were noted in 2025; however, they have not<br />been crucial enough to call for a public emergency<br />of international concern. It is a multi-step<br />process that the WHO declares a PHEIC. They need<br />to look at severity, potential spread of disease,<br />while obviously gathering managerial expertise.<br />With that being said, I doubt there is an outbreak<br />that requires that procedure.","Aaliyah Diaz (30%): I think that it is highly<br />unlikely that the AfD will hold any positions in<br />the German cabinet. For one, given the extremists<br />views of the AfD, it’s difficult to decide whether<br />or not one would one to be associated with them.<br />If anything, I think the AfD will be excluded.","James Martin (1%): I believe there is a 1% chance<br />that the AfD will hold any positions in the German<br />Cabinet (Bundesregierung) following February's<br />election. After the recent election in February,<br />the AfD received a good amount of votes totaling<br />around 20%. However the other political parties<br />have decided not to work with the AfD. So there<br />will be no AfD participating in the coalition that<br />forms the government. Which also means they will<br />not have any members in the German Cabinet.","James Martin (7%): I believe there is a 7%<br />probability that the WHO will declare a new Public<br />Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)<br />before April 28. The WHO only declares a PHEIC<br />when there is a emerging global crisis that poses<br />significant risk. As of now, there are no known<br />threats that would warrant a PHEIC declaration.<br />However if a new disease emerges, rapid existing<br />outbreak, or a resurface of a known disease were<br />to present itself then the WHO would have to<br />intervene.","Teya Hagy (30%): I think that it is highly<br />unlikely that the WHO declares a new public health<br />emergency because the last emergency was instated<br />in August 2024. Monitoring the recent health<br />trends, I don't believe that there will be an<br />outbreak because we are getting out of the winter<br />months, which usually makes people more sick, so I<br />believe that they would have done it by now."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Congress pass<br />legislation establishing<br />a Strategic Bitcoin<br />Reserve by April 28?","Will the AfD hold any<br />positions in the German<br />Cabinet (Bundesregierung)<br />following February's<br />election?","Will the WHO<br />declare a new Public<br />Health Emergency of<br />International Concern<br />(PHEIC) before April 28?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Congress pass<br />legislation establishing<br />a Strategic Bitcoin<br />Reserve by April 28?","Will the AfD hold any<br />positions in the German<br />Cabinet (Bundesregierung)<br />following February's<br />election?","Will the WHO<br />declare a new Public<br />Health Emergency of<br />International Concern<br />(PHEIC) before April 28?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"44c438b74855":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"44c41cba477a":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"44c438b74855","visdat":{"44c438b74855":["function (y) ","x"],"44c41cba477a":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This assumption turned<br />out to be correct! The White House's current<br />negotiating position is that Russia should get<br />everything on its wish list: all the territory<br />it has conquered plus the removal of sanctions<br />in exchange for Ukraine receiving zero security<br />guarantees and getting squeezed for its natural<br />resources. All this is to say that Russia will<br />be actively working towards a ceasefire, and the<br />relevant questions are (1) what sort of losses<br />the Ukrainians will be willing to accept, and<br />(2) whether the technical details of a ceasefire<br />deal can be hammered out in the next two months.<br />I think we're more likely than not to have a<br />ceasefire deal this year, but would be mildly<br />surprised if we saw one by the end of April.","Joe Ornstein (7%): Netanyahu's governing coalition<br />currently has a *one seat* majority in the<br />Knesset, and depends on the votes of three small<br />right-wing parties in order to stay in power.<br />The leadership of all three have made public<br />statements promising to leave the coalition if<br />Israel withdraws from Gaza without first achieving<br />the \"complete destruction\" of Hamas. The Trump<br />administration briefly broke this dynamic by<br />insisting that Israel agree to the first phase of<br />the ceasefire agreement, but following a friendly<br />visit to Washington by Netanyahu, the president<br />has dramatically reversed his position, and is<br />giving Netanyahu a fairly blank check to proceed<br />as he pleases. It's hard to see how Hamas agrees<br />to release the remaining hostages under such<br />conditions, which would pretty thoroughly scuttle<br />the second phase of the ceasefire deal."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,255,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,255,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,NA)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.25,0.38,0.34999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.57999999999999996,0.59999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.57999999999999996,0.55000000000000004,0.69999999999999996,0.34999999999999998,0.37,0.20000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.25,0.42999999999999999,0.33000000000000002,0.25,0.29999999999999999,0.32500000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.28000000000000003,0.59999999999999998,0.39000000000000001,0.55000000000000004,0.14999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.25,0.14999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.56000000000000005,0.25,0.40000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.12,0.59999999999999998,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.050000000000000003,0.20000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.57999999999999996,0.14999999999999999,0.25,0.20000000000000001,0.55000000000000004,0.60999999999999999,0.59999999999999998,0.32000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.55000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.17999999999999999,0.63,0.33000000000000002,0.050000000000000003,0.25,0.40000000000000002,0.050000000000000003],"y":[3.0481012023752556,3.0481715323636309,2.9796810035593806,3.0320165956625713,2.9874121419386936,3.0175385663984344,2.9559946072055028,2.9654556253226474,2.9974931499920787,3.0295063195517287,2.960388598497957,3.0429039241047575,3.0353460060898216,2.9941789584001528,2.9889967787778007,3.0242271562106908,3.0302417706232516,3.0396805495256558,3.0300224431324749,2.9562131757615133,3.0017984586767854,2.978147343848832,3.0192336722277107,2.9579902865225449,2.9548946494935082,2.9853427981492131,2.9879911622963844,3.0211746560642494,2.9833947027334942,2.9711095093749464,2.9699957063188775,2.9577891448745506,2.994086139369756,2.9909225449431687,2.9934669034322723,3.0326240299968048,3.0112265213858338,3.0391139339888467,2.9626010993961245,3.0252526500029489,2.9641785873565825,3.0313835991080849,2.963984383060597,3.0151181424502282,2.9600285878172143,2.9910280931275337,2.968061749683693,3.0448794115334747,2.9988423294154929,2.999253106233664,2.9683840638492258,3.0332176218973474,3.0069386033806951,2.9688534750603139,3.029703980963677,3.0024437145562843,3.0176024091895668,2.9711680443258954,2.9857790772570296,3.0092139671789484,3.0236335867550226,3.0466655944008378,3.0263033547671512,2.9903815154219044],"text":["Aaliyah Diaz (25%): I find it very unlikely that<br />the UGA basketball team will qualify for the NCAA.<br />They have recently had a three losing game streak<br />and are set to compete against the top two teams<br />No. 1 Auburn and No. 2 Florida. Given their past<br />performance and records, it’s not looking too<br />favorable for them.","Addisen Kameron (38%): 38% I know nothing about<br />college basketball. I derailed one of my classes<br />with this question Wednesday and everyone said<br />that we won’t make it. But then I saw all the<br />predictions online and they were mostly positive.<br />I started thinking “Wow, maybe we’ve got this.”<br />But then I remembered the last time I said that.<br />Last month UGA let me down and I realize they<br />basically always do. Based on some wisdom of the<br />crowds and my wish to protect my heart from being<br />failed once again by UGA athletics, I’m going no.","Andreas Papandreou (35%): Georgia has been on<br />a losing streak and in the last 5 games Georgia<br />needs to win at least 3 to have an 80% to make<br />the tournament. We face top teams in Auburn and<br />Florida which Georgia will likely not win. Then<br />Georgia needs to beat South Carolina, Texas,<br />and Vanderbilt. Overall winning 3/5 to make the<br />tournament is unlikely so I do not think Georgia<br />will make the tournament.","Andy Wyatt (40%): UGA is on the bubble but<br />currently slated to be one of the first four out<br />by ESPN’s bracketology. While the team is in a<br />position to still make the tournament, UGA faces<br />No. 1 ranked Auburn and No. 2 ranked Florida<br />before the end of the season. While UGA’s first<br />face off with Auburn was close, Auburn has gotten<br />much better and UGA has gotten worse. In their<br />last matchup, Florida demolished UGA. While UGA<br />has a tough schedule by virtue of SEC play, they<br />don’t necessarily have the wins to make the case<br />for entering the bracket.","Angela Jacobs (58%): UGA's NCAA Tournament chances<br />depend heavily on their remaining schedule.<br />With a 16-10 record and a challenging SEC slate,<br />their Strength of Record ranks in the top 40,<br />helping their case. However, losses to top teams<br />and inconsistency in conference play leave them<br />vulnerable. Wins against ranked opponents like<br />Auburn or Florida could solidify their position,<br />while additional losses might push them out.<br />Analysts remain divided, with projections ranging<br />from a coin flip to slightly favorable odds. Their<br />tournament fate hinges on their final performances<br />and potential SEC Tournament success.","Anna Rachwalski (60%): I believe. We have to beat<br />Vanderbilt in a few weeks–if we don't, it's not<br />happening. UGA is going up against some tough<br />opponents before that–if we win against any of<br />those, the chances also go up. Betting markets<br />and predictions place our chances anywhere from<br />55-60–with some bias and faith, I get to 60.","Archita Gaur (35%): I don't think that UGA<br />basketball will be in the NCAA tournament. Looking<br />at their previous stats, they have gone 4-9 in<br />the SEC, including 2-8 in their most recent 10<br />conference games. They still need to get a few big<br />wins if they want to bid for the NCAA tournament.","Ava Herring (35%): I think that they have somewhat<br />of a chance to be in the tournament because they<br />are in the \"first four out\" or right outside of<br />the projected field. Although they do not have a<br />strong record currently, the odds of them making<br />it to the tournament are kind of small. If they<br />finish out strong, then they have a chance.","Bailey Mattox (65%): Bet Georgia puts the odds at<br />61.5%. I cannot tell if these odds are given by<br />individual people or by a group so I extremized<br />the results a little bit but I did not extremize<br />them as much as I would have if I knew that they<br />were all made by individuals. I also do not know<br />much about basketball so I did not want to make an<br />estimation too heavily one way or another.","Benjamin Jacobstein (58%): They started off<br />strong, and they are a very good first half team,<br />but lately they have been falling off in the<br />second half of all their games. I think it is more<br />likely that they will make March Madness, but only<br />time will tell. The current odds on bracketology<br />sit at 58%. which is also Dr. Ornsteins magic<br />number.","Bennie Trujillano (55%): Looking at past<br />tournament appearances, the men's basketball team<br />has a very unlikely chance of appearing. However,<br />the women's basketball team has had a more<br />than consistent record when it comes to making<br />tournament appearances. Considering performance<br />in recent years and a head coach turnover, I'd say<br />that the women's team has about a 50/50 chance of<br />appearing. Go Dawgs.","Brooke Cheney (70%): Not only does UGA have<br />a decorated coach, they have one of the most<br />difficult schedules in the country. Though they<br />have lost 10 games, 4 of those loses were to<br />the #1 & #2 teams and 1 of their loss was to<br />the #4 team. All this said, UGA has gotten ample<br />practice with high intensity games. They are right<br />on the cusp right now, but sources such as ESPN<br />and USAToday have written off Georgia as one of<br />the first four out. However, a NCAA evaluation<br />tool that takes outside considerations into its<br />predictions besides what is traditional used has<br />placed UGA at 39. There is not much consensus<br />on the situation, and I don't know how they will<br />finish out the season, which is why my prediction<br />is not higher. I do think they have the ability to<br />pull through though.","Chinelo Ireh (35%): After losing against Auburn by<br />2 points a few weeks ago, UGA men's basketball has<br />not really bounced back to its winning streak at<br />the beginning of the season. Once the team started<br />playing against the well-qualified SEC teams<br />consistently, it started losing by bigger margins.<br />Out of the 12 suspected SEC bids for March<br />Madness, UGA is not one of them. If UGA loses to<br />Auburn and Florida in the coming, which it likely<br />will, the likelihood will drop further.","Chloe Cooper (37%): UGA started off the year<br />strong but once they hit SEC play everything<br />went down hill. Georgia currently sits at 16-10<br />overall with a 4-9 SEC record. On top of this they<br />have only won 2 out of their last 10 games. Joe<br />Lunadri, famed bracketology expert, has Georgia<br />as one of the first four teams to not make the<br />tournament, and he is not alone in this thought.<br />Georgia has 5 games left in the season and the<br />next two are against the currently #1 and #2<br />ranked teams in the nation in Auburn and Florida.<br />Georgia is almost definitely losing those two<br />games (although if they did win their chance<br />of making the tournament would skyrocket) so it<br />will likely come down to the last 3 games of the<br />season against South Carolina, Texas, and Vandy<br />(the latter two being predicted as the last four<br />byes of the tournament by Lunardi). I think that<br />if Georgia loses 3 or more of their final 5 games<br />then they will not make the tournament, and with<br />them being favored in only two of them it seems<br />unlikely that the Bulldogs will be able to make<br />the tournament this year.","Da In Song (20%): Past records have shown that the<br />UGA basketball team has not entered the NCAA since<br />2018. It also seems like the new coach that joined<br />since 2022 has not led UGA Men’s Basketball into<br />NCAA for the past three years. The likelihood of<br />this happening this year seems abysmal.","Diane Johnson (15%): Currently, UGA is not<br />predicted to be in the NCAA and it will be<br />difficult to change this considering their next<br />two games in the tournament. UGA is up against<br />Auburn and Florida before moving further and those<br />are the top two teams in the SEC while UGA is only<br />placed at 13. This stark difference in ranking is<br />telling of how the rest of the season will go.","Eli Henderson (25%): Georgia has a very difficult<br />path to make it past Selection Sunday for March<br />Madness this year. Notably, they have games<br />against no.1 Auburn and no.2 Florida back-to-back,<br />followed by sub-par competition between Texas,<br />South Carolina, and Vanderbilt. Winning all<br />three of those last games likely won't move the<br />proverbial needle too far in favor of Georgia, and<br />dropping one would almost certainly put us out of<br />contention. Our best opportunity lies with beating<br />either the 1 or 2 seed in the coming days, which<br />is drastically unlikely, but it would more than<br />likely make a strong case for the Dawgs to play<br />in the tournament. According to ESPN, we have an<br />8% chance to beat Auburn and a 33% chance to beat<br />Florida. However, with a win over one of these<br />teams and a strong finish against our conference<br />opponents, Georgia just might make it.","Elliana Williams (43%): Basketball is such a<br />close-game sport, and that has worked against<br />Georgia in the most recent games. Once a No. 23<br />team, they are far out of the 25 and are projected<br />to be one of the first teams out. I am on the<br />fence about my prediction, as GA has to play<br />Number 1 and 2 ranked teams this week. Winning one<br />of these games would certainly help their chances,<br />but they are on a losing streak and have lost to<br />Auburn already (even though it was close to the<br />actual last second). Im leaning towards no because<br />even when they were ranked, they were not given<br />certainty.","Emma Allen (33%): Since the middle of January, the<br />Dawgs' chances of making the NCAA tournament has<br />gone downhill a bit. They can only lose so many<br />conference games before they start to look like a<br />team that doesn’t belong in the tournament at all.<br />Currently the team is 16-10 and are 4-9 in SEC<br />play including 2-8 over their last 10 conference<br />games. Georgia plays at No. 1 Auburn on Saturday,<br />Feb. 22 and hosts No. 2 Florida next week, which<br />I project they won't win. UGA is just not winning<br />enough.","Emma Pastor (25%): UGA has not made an appearance<br />in the NCAA March Madness bracket since 2015,<br />marking 10 years of UGA basketball missing out on<br />the opportunity. Although the beginning of this<br />year’s season looked promising for us, projections<br />of the team making it to this bracket competition<br />are no longer favorable for the dawgs. The next<br />3 games, we are set to play ranked numbers 1 and<br />2 Auburn and UF, and are also projected to lose<br />to Texas who is ranked at seed 11 compared to us<br />at 12 in the SEC conference. If we do lose these<br />games, I believe it is highly unlikely we will<br />make an appearance in the bracket this year.","Emma Peterson (30%): I said 30% because UGA<br />basketball has had a pretty good season so far<br />with the men's program, however it's just not<br />enough for them to make the NCAA in my opinion.<br />Especially with the next three predicted game<br />losses to Auburn, Florida and Texas. We have a<br />higher shot at making the NIT tournament like we<br />did in 2024. For the women's program the season<br />hasn't been good enough to make either in my<br />opinion, with a 10-16 record.","Ethan Joyce (32.5%): Most \"bubble watch\" websites<br />have us in the first four out. If we have a win<br />against Auburn or Florida then our chances of<br />getting into the tournament will increase greatly.<br />I don't anticipate UGA beating them though. Even<br />with wins against Vanderbilt and South Carolina,<br />we still have the potential to lose to Texas too.<br />I think three losses in the next five games would<br />make the NCAA tournament very improbable. Two<br />losses would give us a fighting chance, with the<br />potential to fall short still.","Ethan Marcum (40%): At one point this semester<br />I truly thought this was going to be an easy<br />question to answer, however, this has proven to<br />come back and haunt me. I would love to sit here<br />and write about how UGA is a clear lock, but that<br />is not the case. It unfortunately is up in the<br />air and depending on how you think they will end<br />their season is what will shape your answer to<br />this question. They currently do somewhat hold<br />their own fate, but it does not seem likely that<br />they will close out the season strong. They are<br />currently 2-8 in their last 10 games and are too<br />inconsistent for me to think they will close out<br />strong. This is one question I am ok with being<br />wrong on, but with all of that being said, I am<br />giving UGA a 40% chance of making march madness.","Grace Mccann (40%): They had a good first half<br />of their season however since then they have been<br />on a steady loosing streak.They also have the<br />number one and two ranked teams as their nest two<br />opponents which does not bode well for both their<br />mental and physical health going into their last<br />three games. However they are Dawgs and Dawgs<br />sometimes pull through so I dont want to go too<br />low.","Grace Reichelderfer (28%): The Georgia Bulldogs<br />are at the cusp of making the NCAA tournament.<br />However, the face two tough games against Auburn<br />(1) and Florida (2) this week. These will be<br />touch matchups that will be very difficult to<br />win. Although it is possible, it is unlikely that<br />Georgia will beat either of those teams which will<br />make it almost impossible for them to make it to<br />the playoffs.","Hampton Barrineau (60%): I check out a few<br />sources and odd makers still think that it is more<br />likely than not that Uga will make it to March<br />madness somehow. Apparently the bar to get into<br />the tournament is much lower than many people<br />would guess. Furthermore, I like to root for<br />an underdog. If KSU can make it then so can the<br />Dawgs.","Hannah Carson (39%): I believe Georgia Basketball<br />has a 39% chance of being in the NCAA Tournament.<br />We started off this season on a good note but<br />have had several losses that have hurt our<br />chances included one against Mississippi State.<br />We are currently projected to be in the \"First<br />4 Teams Out\" this season, which means we are not<br />projected to get into the tournament. However,<br />we have several difficult games coming up this<br />season including games against number 1 Auburn<br />and 2 Florida. If we can win against either one<br />of these teams I think we have a good chance of<br />getting into the NCAA tournament. However, I find<br />it unlikely that we will win given our record this<br />season.","Isaac Fleischer (55%): Most betting markets that I<br />could find give Georgia about a 60% chance to make<br />the tournament. Because sports betting company’s<br />shift the odds so as to make a profit, the actual<br />probability that Georgia will make the tournament<br />is likely slightly lower than this number. Because<br />of this, I believe there is a 55% chance that<br />Georgia will make the March Madness tournament.","Jacob Weiss (15%): UGA basketball has slowed<br />down after a hot start and has a record now that<br />most experts are saying will be not good enough.<br />This means UGA will have to have win out against<br />the number 1 and 2 ranked teams in the nation or<br />win the sec tournament. This will be incredibly<br />difficult this year due to the excellent year the<br />sec is having as a whole","Jake Garrard (10%): Georgia basketball, despite<br />a very good start beginning the season, has<br />struggled against it's very difficult SEC<br />schedule. According to most projections, UGA<br />basketball is likely to be left out of the NCAA<br />tournament. Adding to this the last 5 games,<br />which Georgia almost has to win all of, against<br />the first and second ranked teams in the country,<br />their chances are very slim. It is likely that<br />Georgia will be on the best teams to not make the<br />tournament, but with so much competition in the<br />SEC this year, they will likely fall just short of<br />making the NCAA tournament in March.","Jenny Qiu (25%): Both the men's and women's<br />teams have not had good standings in the division<br />conferences. There are 68 teams that get to<br />compete in March Madness. The winning team of<br />the postseason tournament of every conference<br />automatically get a spot in March Madness (total<br />of 31 teams), but bulldogs & lady bulldogs did not<br />win, so they have to rely on getting a bid from<br />the selection committee. 37 teams will get chosen<br />but we are considered a \"bubble team\" of the SEC,<br />along with Oklahoma, Vanderbilt, Texas, Arkansas.","Jerusalem Greenberg (15%): According to<br />Bracketology, the leading sports predicting<br />website, there is an extremely low chance that<br />UGA will be included in the NCAA tournament.<br />The latest predictions all have UGA outside of<br />the tournament, and their statistics have been<br />atrocious this season. I don't know much about<br />sports, but I asked my father, a much better<br />forecaster and sports predictor who has been<br />paying attention to the season, and he said that<br />he wouldn't give UGA above a 5% because of our<br />performance this season. I will be kinder.","Jessy Lee (85%): I think UGA has a very good<br />chance of making it into the NCAA tournament.<br />The top 31 teams get automatic bids into the<br />tournament and although we stand at 39 currently,<br />they have a good chance of being selected for the<br />field of 68 teams. UGA basketball has a strong<br />strength of schedule and some good wins therefore<br />I believe the committee will select UGA basketball<br />for the NCAA tournament.","Joey Khashan (56%): After a series of simulated<br />scenarios predicting the outcomes of our remaining<br />schedule, I found that the UGA Men’s Basketball<br />team has a 56% chance of receiving an at-large<br />bid to enter the NCAA tournament. While Georgia<br />has not looked good, to say the least for the past<br />month, I think they clean up their act and use<br />their weapons like Asa Newell and RJ Godfrey to<br />get the job done and beat FanDuel’s odds of around<br />a 45% chance.","Joshua Kang (25%): The Bulldogs have hit a rough<br />streak the past few games, despite a strong start<br />in the beginning of the season. In addition, they<br />have been unable to make it to the NCAA Tournament<br />since 2015. In order to make it to the tournament,<br />they will have to likely beat either Auburn or<br />Florida (a major upset), or win their next three<br />straight games against Texas, South Carolina, and<br />Vandy. The chances do not look good.","Julia Loggins (40%): I feel as though the road for<br />UGA to make it to the NCAA would be very difficult<br />to accomplish. According to many predictions, UGA<br />will be a part of the first four teams out. I do<br />not see them winning against Auburn or Florida in<br />the upcoming games. However, they may win against<br />South Carolina, Texas, and Vanderbilt which may<br />get them in. I am not certain they won't get in<br />but I feel as though they would have to perform<br />really strong these next 5 games which I do not<br />think will happen.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (60%): I know virtually nothing<br />about college basketball so after consulting<br />various sports predictions, I have determined the<br />UGA Basketball team has a 60% chance of being in<br />the NCAA tournament. Their coming games will be<br />challenging as they play against both Auburn and<br />Florida, ranked 1st and 2nd place respectively.<br />Winning at least one of these games would greatly<br />increase the likelihood of making it to the NCAA<br />championship. Because we will play Florida at<br />home, I am hoping we can redeem ourselves after<br />losing to them earlier this year. Additionally,<br />we only narrowly lost to Auburn and can hopefully<br />full out a victory.","Kelsey Dyar (30%): The UGA basketball team has<br />looked better this year than in past years, and<br />has been projected to be in the NCAA tournament<br />for part of the season. However, the dawgs have<br />been on a bit of a losing streak with their last<br />game against Missouri bringing their record to<br />16-10 (with a losing 4-9 record in SEC play).<br />Their team's schedule has been one of the hardest<br />because the SEC overall has had an incredible<br />season. While there is still hope for the team<br />to make the bracket, it does not seem likely.<br />USAToday predicts that UGA will be one of the<br />first four out of the bracket. Their next two<br />games are against No. 1 Auburn and No. 2 Florida,<br />which will be very tough games. If they can win<br />those games they definitely have a chance to be in<br />the tournament, but it does not seem likely.","Kyle Smith (12%): We came out strong in the<br />beginning of the year vs non conference opponents<br />but as the season has gone on, we have gotten<br />worse and worse. There is very little chance we<br />will win either of the next two games as it is<br />against Auburn and Florida. I sadly am close to<br />certain we will not be in the tournament. Even if<br />we did somehow make it (very unlikely) we would<br />probably lose the first game due to our poor<br />playing.","Lawton Smith (60%): Even though UGA will most<br />likely not make March Madness, I just cant bet<br />against them. Not only is it impossible for me to<br />not bet against us, there is a legit shot where<br />Asa and Silas can pull this off. It comes down to<br />Saturday and how we play against Auburn. ( must<br />win game)","Lillie Puhrmann (45%): UGA has had a very<br />inconsistent season with basketball this year.<br />They have had very strong moments, but also<br />some hard losses. With their 5 upcoming games,<br />they will have to perform very well as their<br />performance is crucial to make it into the NCAA<br />tournament. I believe they will recieve a bid if<br />they play their hearts out during these upcoming<br />games.","Mabry Cartwright (40%): I am placing the<br />probability below 50%. Currently, there are<br />projections that UGA men’s basketball is right<br />outside of the projected bubble of teams making<br />it to the NCAA tournament. The men’s basketball<br />team would have to do exceptionally well in<br />their upcoming games and with their current<br />16-10 record, I do not see this happening. Their<br />upcoming schedule is also quite challenging.<br />UGA Women’s basketball is not even in the<br />consideration for the NCAA tournament.","Margaret Pope (5%): Although UGA has had one of<br />its best seasons since 2011, the Dawgs have been<br />unable to hold steady on their wins. It could be<br />said that we are a \"second half team\", but the<br />past 3 games have been consecutive losses. UGA<br />plays Auburn and Florida, both the top ranked<br />teams in the country, and then has their final 3<br />games against Texas, USC, and Vanderbilt. Assuming<br />UGA can't beat Auburn or Florida, the hoop dawgs<br />must win their last 3 games. Although it would be<br />nice to have faith in the great men on the hoop<br />dawgs, I find it highly unlikely we clinch a spot<br />in the NCAA tournament.","Maston Corn (20%): UGA Basketball will have to<br />win at least one of the two games versus Florida<br />or Auburn to receive an at-large bid for the<br />tournament. It seems likely that they could win<br />their games against South Carolina, Texas, and<br />Vanderbilt but very unlikely that they could beat<br />number one Auburn at Auburn and number two Florida<br />especially after Florida beat us by 30 points<br />last game. They have to make an impression to the<br />committee that they deserve to be there and after<br />currently being on a three-game losing streak and<br />not having much success in recent years at the end<br />of the year it seems highly unlikely.","Meera Srinivasan (40%): Many sports experts<br />have weighed in on whether or not UGA Basketball<br />will be one of the teams to play in the NCAA<br />tournament. Some have given UGA a 50/50 chance,<br />citing the team’s recent game record of 16-10<br />overall and 4-9 within the SEC, the toughest<br />conference. Some are more optimistic, claiming<br />that UGA has plenty of opportunities over its<br />final five regular season games to work its way<br />back into the NCAA Tournament field. UGA plays<br />at No. 1 Auburn on Saturday, Feb. 22 and hosts<br />No. 2 Florida next week, and has to get a few<br />big wins in order to boost their March Madness<br />hopes. Personally, I find it unlikely that they<br />will manage a few big wins so late in the season,<br />but I do not think it is out of the realm of<br />possibility.","Mia Pisani (58%): UGA Basketball has not qualified<br />for the NCAA tournament since 2015, but this year<br />may be different. ESPN's \"Bubble Watch\" has our<br />odds of qualifying at 50%, many claiming our hopes<br />at the tournament are looking slimmer since the<br />recent losing streak. UGA Basketball is currently<br />4-9 in SEC play and 16-10 overall. However, the<br />dawgs will just need to acquire a bid to make it<br />to the tournament. It is likely they will receive<br />some bias from the selection committee, as the<br />SEC has been so successful this season. This is<br />mostly dependent on how we perform in upcoming<br />games against SEC teams, such as Auburn, Florida,<br />Texas, South Carolina, and Vandy. If the losing<br />streak continues, it is likely the Dawgs will<br />not qualify. However, I am slightly optimistic,<br />putting their odds a little above 50/50.","Milan Yadav (15%): As much as it pains me to<br />say this, our b-ball team is not at its highest<br />potential yet (but will be in a couple more years<br />when Mike White gets better at recruiting). As of<br />now we stand in the bottom 4-5 teams in the SEC<br />after a series of disappointing losses during the<br />season, and have a handful of games left. To make<br />it to the NCAA tourney, a team has to win their<br />conference tourney, and I do not see us beating<br />a team like Florida or Auburn unfortunately.<br />The only other way is to get an at-large bid,<br />but these are given with no set formnula by the<br />selection committee and usually for higher ranked<br />teams.","Nathaniel Long (25%): Currently, UGA has a 4-9<br />win/lose ratio and is ranked 12th overall in<br />the Southern NCAA teams. While 16 teams from the<br />Southern NCAA will enter the NCAA tournament, it<br />is unlikely that UGA basketball will get enough<br />wins before the time of the tournament, owing<br />to their relatively bad current standings in the<br />NCAA.","Niomi Nurse (20%): It is highly unlikely that UGA<br />Basketball will make it to the NCAA tournament<br />because of their performance throughout the season<br />so far. UGA Basketball is currently 16-10 this<br />season. It seems that the UGA team has not scored<br />enough wins to make it very far in the season this<br />year, but there may be room for redemption during<br />march madness.","Pablo Martinez (55%): the uga basketball team has<br />not seen a march madness appearance in almost 10<br />years. However this year seems to be going very<br />well for them. Odd makers have them making the<br />tournament at 60% but they still have some games<br />left in order to clean up there resume for the<br />playoffs. They still need to fight number 1 auburn<br />and number 2 florida. wins from any of these games<br />will most likely help there case in getting into<br />the march madeness bracket. And with the Florida<br />game being played at uga territory only time will<br />tell","Quintin Gallardo (61%): Currently, I think uga<br />basketball has around a 61% chance of making<br />the NCAA tournament. This is that most likely<br />the committee will consider the difficulty of<br />the schedule Georgia has faced in the year and<br />hopefully provide a seed, even though we are on<br />the lower end of a win record. Currently with our<br />record of 16 and 10 and five games left it looks<br />unlikely especially considering two of the games<br />being against the one and two seat, but several<br />key players will make a comeback sometime next<br />week and hopefully improve the odds.","Rebecca Mcadam (60%): I think there is a decent<br />chance that UGA will make the NCAA championship<br />this year. Professional sports projectors believe<br />UGA has anywhere from a 50 to a 70% chance of<br />making the bracket, as a last pick for the SEC.<br />Given the difficulty of their schedule this year,<br />coupled with the possibility that they could beat<br />Auburn or Florida next week (very small chance), I<br />see them potentially making the bracket this year.","Riley Batz (32%): UGA Wire has reported that UGA<br />basketball is expected to miss the NCAA Tournament<br />in March. Georgia (16-10, 4-9 SEC) has five<br />conference games and an SEC Tournament to have<br />an opportunity to make the tournament. They are<br />currently the 3rd team out, and need to get a win<br />over Auburn (away) or Florida this week- both who<br />they have previously lost to, and are the #1 and<br />#2 teams, respectively. An upset would boost them<br />majorly but three wins over unranked opponents of<br />Texas, South Carolina and Vanderbilt is the only<br />path to the tournament if the next two games are<br />lost. Ultimately, I think it will be difficult for<br />UGA to make the tournament at this point.","Ruby Douglas (20%): As of April 2024, UGA<br />basketball was not consistently reaching the NCAA<br />tournament. It seems UGA has a good shot at the<br />NCAA tournament this year because Georgia has two<br />high-stakes games ahead of them that could affect<br />their chances of winning. If Georgia beats No.<br />1 Auburn and then again No. 2 Florida, they will<br />bolster their already good chances of making it<br />into the tournament. Georgia has one of the most<br />demanding schedules in the country, yet has done<br />comparatively well to their previous seasons. If<br />they continue to get in their way, then they will<br />not have a shot at the tournament; however, if<br />they use these games to their advantage, then they<br />will certainly have a chance.","Sarah Joyce (55%): After looking at sports betting<br />projections and analysis, it seems that most think<br />that UGA has a little over a 50% chance of getting<br />into the tournament. These are better odds than<br />in years past because UGA has played better this<br />year, but some projections did note that UGA’s<br />schedule is getting tougher.","Sreya Pandyaram (35%): The chances of UGA<br />basketball making the tournament are slim,<br />primarily because they've faced a challenging<br />schedule, and their remaining games are against<br />tough opponents as well. Georgia currently has<br />a 16-10 record, but this does not mean that they<br />cannot make the NCAA as there are other factors<br />such as who they are facing, performance in<br />general, and more that can shape the decision.<br />Therefore it is not impossible, but it is rare.<br />An example is the Syracuse team in the 2016-2017<br />season, however Georgia would have to do very well<br />with the upcoming teams. With Auburn, there may<br />be a loss for Georgia due to their usual strong<br />performance, Florida could be a more balanced<br />game, Texas will be difficult, Georgia could<br />win against South Carolina, and with Vanderbilt<br />there's an inconsistency. Georgia would have<br />to win 3 of the five games and most likely with<br />the strong contenders. Currently Texas lost 3,<br />Florida 4, and Auburn 2. While Georgia has beat<br />these teams in the past, again it is important to<br />consider player changes, homeport games, and the<br />exploitation of weaknesses.","Teya Hagy (15%): I think that it is not very<br />probable that UGA basketball will be in the NCAA<br />tournament. They currently have a 16-10 overall<br />record this year and still have tough teams to<br />play ahead. It is not likely that they will win<br />against Auburn or Florida. I do not think that<br />they will make it, which is why my guess is<br />15/100.","Thomas Smith (18%): The University of Georgia’s<br />basketball team is doing a lot better than they<br />have in recent memory and is having a better<br />year. That being said we are still not very good.<br />We are currently ranked 39th out of all college<br />basketball teams. While I still think there’s a<br />small probability we make it I do not think it’s<br />likely.","Tiyanah Rowtham (63%): The UGA Basketball team<br />last made the NCAA tournament in 2015 but I have<br />high hopes for them this year. They still have<br />to go against top ranked schools such as Auburn,<br />Florida, Texas, South Carolina, and Vanderbilt.<br />Teamrankings assume UGA has a 79% chance of them<br />making it to the NCAA Tournament, while ESPN<br />estimates that they have a 50% chance. The team's<br />ability to play well is heavily influenced by the<br />crowd, so considering ⅗ of these games are away,<br />I assume UGA has a 63% chance of making it to the<br />NCAA tournament.","Townsend Turner (33%): The odds, according to the<br />experts, are as accurate as a coin toss. Some say<br />they make it; some say they don’t. According to<br />TODAY’s Bracketology, UGA is one of the top four<br />teams not to qualify for March Madness. This does<br />make sense, as they finished in the Final Four<br />of the National Invitational Tournament (NIT),<br />also known as the “consolation tournament,” last<br />year. However, this week, NCAA correspondent and<br />basketball expert Andy Katz released his bracket<br />prediction, and on it were the Georgia Bulldogs<br />as one of the final four teams to qualify for<br />the tournament. All in all, the odds are up in<br />the air, and Georgia certainly controls their own<br />destiny. If they beat either #1 ranked Auburn away<br />on the 22nd or #2 ranked Florida at home on the<br />25th, it is hard to see them not on a bracket.<br />However, if they do not do so, it is hard to see<br />them on a bracket.","Tristan Thompson (5%): The UGA Men’s and Women’s<br />basketball teams have struggled against conference<br />opponents this season. The men’s team currently<br />holds a 4-9 record in conference play, and the<br />women’s is at 2-10. The Men’s team take on the<br />number 1 and 2 teams in the country (Auburn and<br />Florida), and the men’s team has not shown that<br />they have a chance to win either of these games<br />based on their performance over the second half<br />of the season. It is for this reason that I do not<br />see UGA making the NCAA tournament.","Wyatt Dasher (25%): To make it to the tournament<br />I read that they have to win 4 out of the next<br />six games. There next two game are against number<br />1 and number 2. Even if they win every game after<br />the next two the odds are not in their favor.<br />A 7 game losing streak doesn’t get you into the<br />tournament. Go dawgs and always hope (just not<br />betting on it)","Wyatt Stevenson (40%): While Georgia has above<br />a .500 record, their in conference record is 4-9<br />which is one of the worst records in the SEC.<br />As of now there are only 12 SEC bids to make the<br />march madness to make the tournament, and Georgia<br />is the first one out. Technically, they can still<br />make the playoffs with a couple of big wins;<br />however, with the remaining schedule it does not<br />look good for the Dawgs. They still have to play<br />the #1 and #2 teams in NCAA basketball, so it does<br />not look very promising.","James Martin (5%): I think there is a 5%<br />probability that the UGA Basketball will be in<br />the NCAA tournament. As of Wednesday, UGA was<br />projected to be one of the first four teams out of<br />the tournament. Their schedule has been difficult<br />this year with playing ten ranked SEC teams. They<br />have also lost to the 5 of 6 ranked teams in the<br />SEC.

Diaz (0%): I find it highly unlikely<br />that Russia and the Ukraine will agree to a<br />ceasefire by April 28, 2025. Russia began its<br />invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and it only seems<br />to be getting worse rather than better. In a<br />recent meeting between the United States and<br />Russia that took place in Saudi Arabia, plans of<br />a possible negotiation were discussed after the<br />exclusion of other countries and Ukraine itself.<br />This blatant lack of cooperation and inclusion<br />of the invaded country leaves it very unclear<br />and almost impossible for a ceasefire to be made<br />now, especially because the president of Ukraine<br />Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made it clear that they<br />will not accept a watered-down deal or one that<br />is made without the input of the people it’s<br />supposed to be protecting. Leaving out Ukraine and<br />the rest of Europe while making a decision that<br />should include its input was a bad move on the<br />part of the United States, and I believe that this<br />action will play a huge role later on as to why a<br />ceasefire has not and will not be met by April 28.","Aaliyah Diaz (30%): In my personal opinion I don’t<br />believe that the IDF will completely withdraw from<br />Gaza on April 28th. The Israeli Defense Minister<br />Israel Kratz had shared plans for the relocation<br />of Palestinians and plans for the rebuilding of<br />Gaza. These plans and proposals have been rejected<br />by the Palestinians people so I find it very<br />difficult to say that the IDF will be withdrawn<br />from Gaza.","Addisen Kameron (0%): 0% No shot the IDF will<br />withdraw from Gaza by April 28th for a lot of<br />reasons. This ceasefire is already really shaky<br />and feels like it could fall apart any day now<br />since Israel keeps violating it. Israel says<br />they’ll only withdraw if they eliminate Hamas<br />which is basically impossible. Israel wants to<br />claim the territory and I think they’ll make any<br />excuse to get it done. Netanyahu is worried that<br />if he keeps failing, his career may end and his<br />incarceration for corruption may begin. Trump<br />and Friends™ are giving Israel dangerous and<br />inflammatory go-aheads to ethnically cleanse the<br />Palestinians.","Andreas Papandreou (65%): With the prediction<br />date set nearly 2 months away there is a lot of<br />room for randomness to effect the outcome of a<br />ceasefire. However, I believe that due to the<br />current talks that are already occurring between<br />the US and Russia, in addition to the unlikely<br />continuation of aid from the US to Ukraine, there<br />will probably be a ceasefire agreement by April<br />28th.","Andreas Papandreou (30%): I think there are<br />two reasons that the IDF will not be completely<br />withdrawn from Gaza by the end of April. The first<br />is that the Trump administration has voiced its<br />opinion that the Palestinians in Gaza should be<br />removed from their land, this would likely require<br />the help of the IDF. The second is that the<br />ceasefire is already running into some issues with<br />Hamas threatening to delay the return of hostages<br />accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire.","Andy Wyatt (30%): Ukraine is currently not<br />involved in ceasefire negotiations between the<br />U.S. and Russia. Ukraine is pushing for full<br />territorial restoration and security guarantees<br />(i.e. NATO membership), but the White House has<br />put both of these prospects off the table. Still,<br />American pressure will accelerate the timeline for<br />a peace deal. The U.S. has far and away provided<br />the most military aid to Ukraine. With Trump<br />clearly indicating he wants the war to end, the<br />U.S. is unlikely to direct any more supplements<br />to keep Ukraine afloat. At the same time, a<br />successful negotiation between Ukraine and Russia<br />by May will be challenging given that either side<br />will want to make one last push to put them in a<br />good negotiating position.","Andy Wyatt (20%): Israel and Hamas are behind<br />schedule on negotiations, which were supposed<br />to begin on February 3, to proceed with Phase<br />II. On paper, Phase II involves the full Israeli<br />withdrawal from Gaza. With the removal of troops<br />from Netzarim Corridor, the IDF is currently only<br />present near the Egyptian border and a buffer<br />zone along the Israeli border. Still, Trump’s plan<br />for a Gaza riviera has complicated the ceasefire<br />framework, which has been moving slowly anyway.<br />Full withdrawal by the IDF is unlikely by May, but<br />may become more possible later this year.","Angela Jacobs (15%): A ceasefire before April 28<br />is unlikely due to ongoing military operations,<br />Russia’s push for territorial gains, and Ukraine’s<br />refusal to negotiate without Russian withdrawal.<br />Continued Western aid strengthens Ukraine’s<br />resistance, while Putin’s election strategy favors<br />aggression. With no diplomatic breakthroughs<br />or external pressure, fighting is expected to<br />continue.","Angela Jacobs (28%): While ongoing diplomatic<br />efforts and partial withdrawals signal a possible<br />shift toward de-escalation, continued hostilities<br />and Israel’s stated objective to fully dismantle<br />Hamas’s control make a complete withdrawal<br />unlikely within this timeframe. External pressure,<br />particularly from the U.S. and regional powers,<br />could speed up negotiations, but the current<br />intensity of the conflict suggests that an<br />extended military presence is probable.","Anna Rachwalski (35%): Polymarket has 840k volume<br />resulting in a 54% chance that a ceasefire occurs<br />before July. ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all say<br />somewhere between 10-30–which I think is slightly<br />pessimistic. With all this and background info<br />about how volatile and stalemated this situation<br />appears, I put it at 35%.","Anna Rachwalski (10%): The IDF currently keeps<br />a limited BORDER presence in Gaza, and conducts<br />limited military operations. I think this will<br />continue for the forseeable future, even if a<br />ceasefire or some sort of peace agreement is<br />reached. Marco Rubio just said that Hamas must be<br />\"eliminated,\" and the US supports Israel with the<br />ceasefire–they have no reason to pull out.","Archita Gaur (45%): This is a difficult question<br />to answer at this time. There seems to be a<br />lot of cooperation between Russia and the US<br />right now, with talks of ending the war. I think<br />there is a chance that the war will end due to<br />these cooperative talks; however there aren't<br />any strategic talks between Ukraine and Russia<br />and they both want to end the war on their own<br />terms. There is definitely a higher chance that a<br />ceasefire will happen this year.","Archita Gaur (30%): There is a ceasefire in<br />place where the second phase requires the IDF<br />to withdraw from Gaza and lift the blockade.<br />However, talks about the second phase will begin<br />and we will actually see if Israel will agree to<br />this. I don't think it is probable that they will<br />completely withdraw from Gaza by April 28th due to<br />Netanyahu's talk about supporting Trump's plan in<br />Gaza.","Ava Herring (25%): Neither side has shown much<br />interest in a ceasefire agreement any time soon,<br />so I believe that chances are pretty unlikely.<br />Both sides seem pretty committed to their military<br />goals. Russia has continued its offensive powers<br />while Ukraine has committed to defending its<br />territory. I believe there would have to be<br />some political shift in order for there to be a<br />ceasefire agreement.","Ava Herring (20%): I think that although there is<br />a small chance, I am not sure that this ceasefire<br />agreement is the one that ends this conflict once<br />and for all. Based on past actions between Israel<br />and Hamas when there have been agreements in the<br />past, I am not sure if this ceasefire agreement<br />will live long-term. Both sides have expressed a<br />reluctance to even go through with the agreement,<br />and it has led to concerns about how long it will<br />actually last.","Ayaan Fazal (25%): While there are external<br />diplomatic efforts to resolve the war, I find it<br />quite improbable that there will be a ceasefire<br />due to the combination of Ukraine's exclusion from<br />pivotal negotiations, steadfast military resolve,<br />and historical challenges in enforcing ceasefires.<br />Both Russia and Ukraine show unwillingness to<br />compromise as well. While Trump plans on changing<br />this, I find it unlikely that there will be any<br />sort of agreement to a ceasefire before April<br />28th.","Ayaan Fazal (20%): Given the current state of<br />Gaza, I find it highly unlikely that the Prime<br />Minister will remove any of the troops. Since<br />the end of 2023, there has been thousands of<br />Israeli troops in Gaza. Although there is talk of<br />a ceasefire, this does not permit removing troops<br />and given the short window, I do not think it will<br />happen.","Bailey Mattox (21%): It seems more likely than<br />the chance of IDF pulling out of Israel, but this<br />still doesn't seem likely, especially considering<br />that there was no Ukrainian or European ambassador<br />at the most recent talks between the US and Russia<br />about a ceasefire agreement and Ukraine has made<br />it clear that they will not sign anything they<br />have not been a part of negotiating. On the other<br />hand though, Ukraine has also said they cannot<br />win the war without the US so they may be more apt<br />right now to agree to a ceasefire made by the US<br />and Russia.","Bailey Mattox (17%): Previous ceasefires have not<br />held up well and I see little reason to believe<br />this one will either. I think Israel's plan is<br />to get all of their hostages back and then resume<br />fighting, but anticipating this, I think Hamas<br />will keep a hostage or two which will give Israel<br />an excuse to attack Hamas.","Benjamin Jacobstein (37%): Based on the current<br />US and Russia diplomatic efforts, and the growing<br />war fatigue worldwide, I think there is growing<br />pressure to put a temporary pause on the conflict.<br />But because Ukraine is currently being excluded<br />from recent negotiations, I put my answer at 37%,<br />because this is all still rapidly changing and<br />and there is quite the possibility that while a<br />ceasefire is likely in the near future, it might<br />not be by April 28.","Benjamin Jacobstein (40%): When the U.S.<br />Secretary of State, Marco Rubio visited Israel, he<br />emphasized the U.S. support for Israel’s objective<br />to “eradicate” Hamas in Gaza. I am not sure that<br />Hamas will take that lightly, and considering this<br />is a 3 phase complex plan to end the conflict,<br />I believe it is less likely that we see all IDF<br />withdrawn from Gaza on April 28.","Bennie Trujillano (40%): News of a ceasefire had<br />been stagnant up until this past week, as Putin<br />and Zelenski both recently spoke with Donald<br />Trump about a ceasefire. While Trump claims a<br />ceasefire is possible and both sides are willing,<br />I feel it is unlikely it would be accomplished<br />by April 28th. The ceasefire was one of Trump's<br />campaign promises, and I'm sure that a ceasefire<br />will eventually be made, but a ceasefire by<br />the deadline feels unlikely. Its likelier than<br />previously, but not enough.","Bennie Trujillano (10%): The IDF will not<br />completely withdraw from Gaza by April 28th,<br />as Israel and America clearly have an invested<br />interest in the territory. Trump and Netanyahu<br />have recently been very vocal about a takeover<br />of the Gaza Strip and the expulsion of the<br />Palestinians. While there is international<br />pressure against Israel, they have American<br />support. If there is any kind of withdrawal, it<br />would be limited or temporary.","Brooke Cheney (65%): As of 2/18, US and Russian<br />officials have met to discuss war efforts where<br />both sides have agreed on 4 principles. Given<br />the new Trump administration's eagerness to end<br />the war, I think it will end up happening. The<br />argument not in favor of a ceasefire is concerns<br />about Ukraine having a seat at the table. However,<br />ultimately, the powerhouse of the US will have<br />more leverage than Ukraine both politically and<br />economically. My hesitation in my probability<br />comes from the fact that negotiations sometimes<br />take. While I do think this war will end in 2025,<br />my clarity on the exact timeline is hazy.","Brooke Cheney (4%): According to the Ministry<br />of External Affairs, the ceasefire deal between<br />Israel and Hamas contains 3 phases, lasting 42<br />days each. If all goes according to plan, then<br />the IDF will still be in Gaza but with a much<br />smaller presence. In addition, according to<br />Reuters, there was an Israeli airstrike today<br />(Feb 16), which could increase tensions. Given how<br />delicate the situation is there, any false move<br />could jeopardize the entire plan. This war has<br />been raging on for 15 months, and it seems highly<br />unlikely for the end of it to be on the horizon by<br />April 28.","Chinelo Ireh (19%): I do not believe there is<br />a high chance of the Russia-Ukraine War ending<br />because the current peace talks are not including<br />President Zelenskyy or really any Ukrainian<br />officials. President Trump is much more open to<br />negotiating with President Putin than the Biden<br />administration and this may not bode well with<br />the Ukrainian government. I doubt that there will<br />be a ceasefire like what is asked in the question<br />because of the collusion between the American and<br />Russian administrations.","Chinelo Ireh (35%): Despite the ceasefire deal<br />reached on January 19, the IDF has not fully<br />withdrawn from the Gaza strip and West Bank. The<br />terms of the agreement were to free the hostages<br />and prisoners while also stopping fire from<br />both sides. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that<br />Israel will not hold its end of the bargain if<br />the hostages are not released. There has been some<br />debate over whether Hamas will release the right<br />amount of hostages at the right time, so I doubt<br />that there will be a full withdrawal from Gaza by<br />April 28.","Chloe Cooper (23%): Even after Trumps meeting with<br />Russian president Vladimir Putin it doesn't seem<br />like the two will be able to come to an agreement<br />with Ukraine and Zelenskyy that Zelenskyy will<br />accept before April 28th. Zelenskyy has made<br />it clear that Ukraine wants to be involved in<br />the discussion of things like this, and Trump<br />and Putin went on and negotiated without him.<br />Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine won't sign<br />any hasty ceasefires that aren't agreeable for<br />Ukraine, since he believes that the United States<br />has joined the fray on the side of Russia to get<br />Putin what he wants. Is 2 months and some change<br />too hasty? Even if it isn't I don't think that<br />anyone will be able to come to an agreement before<br />the deadline due to how much tension is still<br />present between Russia and Ukraine.","Chloe Cooper (26%): I think that this has been the<br />toughest question for me to come up with an answer<br />to so far, as trying to do research hasn't led<br />me to much of a conclusion. From everything I've<br />seen it doesn't seem like anyones too confident<br />on the future of IDF troops in Gaza. Although<br />the ceasefire was passed, tensions are still very<br />high in Gaza, with plenty of death and destruction<br />still occurring as troops attempt to leave. I<br />ultimately don't think that the IDF will be able<br />to completely withdrawal all of their troops in<br />time to hit the April 28th deadline due to the<br />remaining tensions between the two countries,<br />as well as the fact that the ceasefire was only<br />signed recently, and it usually takes a decent<br />amount of time to withdrawal military troops from<br />an area. The fine print for this question also<br />helps my prediction of no because there has to be<br />a \"consensus of credible media reports\" that say<br />that all troops are withdrawn. Seems like too fast<br />of a timeline to be resolved in two and a half<br />months.","Christian Barr (40%): In order to resolve the<br />ongoing confrontation and weakening diplomatic<br />ties, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and<br />U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio have started<br />high-level discussions in Riyadh. Restoring<br />embassy personnel levels and investigating<br />possible peace talks are the main topics of<br />the discussions. However, the fact that Ukraine<br />was left out of the first round of negotiations<br />raises questions about the validity and viability<br />of agreements without Ukrainian participation.<br />European politicians caution that signing a<br />ceasefire without a comprehensive peace deal might<br />cause further instability. Global markets have<br />been greatly influenced by the ongoing conflict,<br />and trade tensions and oil prices have an adverse<br />effect on economic stability, raising concerns<br />about both geopolitical and economic factors.<br />It is possible to have a ceasefire before April<br />28th but this depends on Ukraine's effective<br />participation and alignment with all parties in<br />agreement talks.","Christian Barr (15%): By March 6, the Israeli<br />Defense Force (IDF) plans to have begun a phased<br />retreat, with an emphasis on strategic locations<br />such as the Philadelphi and Netzarim Corridors.<br />However, because of political, security, and<br />the possibility of a new conflict, Israel has<br />not committed to a complete departure by April<br />28. Since the US backs Israel's stance, a<br />complete departure is impossible unless Hamas is<br />undermined. A complete withdrawal is opposed by<br />right-wing forces.","Da In Song (20%): I do not think the EU would<br />be open to the idea of Ukraine becoming Russian<br />territory on the principle that it might set a<br />precedent for future Russian military movement.<br />The ceasefire must come on the conditions that<br />Ukraine will remain an independent state: but<br />Ukraine will be reluctant to meet concessions the<br />US and Russia are laying out for them.","Da In Song (70%): Everything seems to point<br />towards the IDF’s retreat from the Philadelphi<br />Corridor. But will it happen by April 28th?<br />Considering the first negotiation took three<br />months (November to January), the second may take<br />faster. Nothing can be certain. Israel may be<br />reluctant to let go of the Philadelphi Corridor,<br />the key to maintaining a foot in Gaza after<br />giving up Netzarim. Or the public— and therefore<br />Netanyahu and his ministers— may continue to push<br />the peace talks over the course of this month. I<br />hesitantly give a 70% chance, in hopes that the<br />protests for hostages will continue to push the<br />narrative more than Trump’s willingness to commit<br />ethnic cleansing. Between one positive demand and<br />another extreme to ending a war, the result has to<br />settle positively regardless of where it falls.","Diane Johnson (5%): Earlier today, US and Russian<br />officials met to discuss potential peace deals<br />regarding the war but neither Trump nor Putin were<br />present and neither was any kind of representative<br />from Ukraine. This shows that a ceasefire between<br />the two warring countries is not being considered<br />seriously, and even though Trump promised to<br />end this war (during the first 24 hours of his<br />presidency) Putin is reportedly unwilling to make<br />peace until he has what he wants, which is to<br />obtain Ukraine. Furthermore, it is unlikely that<br />Ukraine will surrender either as its president<br />Zelenskyy is determined to win independence.","Diane Johnson (25%): Given the extensive history<br />between Israel and Palestine I think the IDF will<br />still be in Gaza. There is a new ceasefire that<br />allows for the slow release of hostages on both<br />sides, (30 Palestinian prisoners for each civilian<br />hostage and) but this is only phase one. Over this<br />80 day period, there’s many chances for something<br />to go awry and for the ceasefire to backfire,<br />similar to how it did in May 2024. The ceasefire<br />agreement from this time is similar to the current<br />ceasefire so given this similarity it is possible<br />that it will fail again.","Eli Henderson (24%): Trump has made it his goal<br />to resolve the Ukraine-Russian war before Easter,<br />so this lines up well with our timetable. That<br />being said, I find it unlikely that a ceasefire<br />proposal will be drafted before that time that<br />Ukraine would actually agree with. US officials<br />met with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia this<br />week without the presence of Ukraine or any other<br />European countries. Zelensky has stated that<br />there will be no acceptance of a ceasefire that<br />Ukraine is not actively a part of in negotiations.<br />Furthermore, Pete Hegseth has been firm in his<br />stance of limiting foreign support in terms of<br />military aid from the US, which Ukraine cannot<br />survive without as it stands. That being said, the<br />US has requested $500 billion in rare materials<br />from Ukraine as reimbursement, which Ukraine has<br />been fine with, but on the condition of their<br />continued military support from the US. The<br />current ceasefire plans which Trump and co. have<br />proposed are far from desirable for Ukraine, and<br />would play heavily into the hand of Putin.","Eli Henderson (41%): While this question is much<br />closer to a coin toss given the tumultuous nature<br />of the Israel-Hamas war, it is further supported<br />by the fact that Trump wants to take over what<br />remains of Gaza. I would still give the edge for<br />there being some IDF presence when April 28 rolls<br />around, given the short time frame and the fact<br />that there have been reports that Israel will<br />remain until Hamas is eliminated.","Elliana Williams (35%): Though there has been<br />partial withdrawal from Gaza by the Israel Defense<br />Forces, they have not officially commented on<br />withdrawal from the eastern part. I do think it<br />is possible that they have a complete withdrawal,<br />however, with President Trump saying that he<br />is going to create something different and<br />revolutionary, I wonder if it will be completely<br />withdrawn.","Emma Allen (18%): Recent developments suggest that<br />neither Russia nor Ukraine is willing to negotiate<br />a ceasefire without significant concessions, which<br />neither appears ready to make. Ukraine continues<br />to receive military aid from Western allies, while<br />Russia is reinforcing its positions and escalating<br />attacks. Diplomatic efforts, such as efforts<br />made by the US, have so far failed to lead to<br />substantial progress toward peace. Additionally,<br />Ukraine elections are set for beginning of May<br />and Russian president Putin was recently reelected<br />in March of 2024. No change of power seems like<br />potential for either actor, making any agenda<br />changes even more unlikely.","Emma Allen (28%): Given the vague wording of<br />the deal, unresolved questions about governance<br />and aid distribution, and Israel’s continued<br />military objectives, it is unlikely that Stage 3<br />will be fully completed by April 28th. The deal<br />has crucial elements that are arguably up in<br />the air such as humanitarian aid and how it will<br />be distributed. The greatest problem with the<br />agreement is arguably that the two sides do not<br />have equal motivation to preserve it. The stakes<br />are different for the Israeli government who<br />is still committed to removing Hamas from power<br />while also rejecting the Palenstine’s authority<br />reinstatement in Gaza.","Emma Pastor (47%): President Trump was just cited<br />by a Bloomberg report saying he wants a ceasefire<br />in Ukraine by Easter, which is April 20 of this<br />year. However, we must take this with a grain of<br />salt considering his earlier promise to end it<br />in 24 hours. That being said, a US negotiators<br />met with Russian diplomats yesterday, beginning<br />negotiations for such a ceasefire. They were able<br />to agree on 4 principles to move forward with<br />the possibility of a ceasefire, starting with the<br />restaffing of embassies. President Zelenskyy has<br />been quoted as saying that he believes the US is<br />attempting to please Putin with this \"quick-win\"<br />solution, noting that Ukraine will not sign just<br />any deal for the sake of it, as the future of<br />their country is at stake. European leaders also<br />fear that a quick ceasefire could give Russia the<br />opportunity to mobilize again and attack Ukraine<br />again or another European nation.","Emma Pastor (35%): I find it hard to believe<br />that the IDF will completely withdraw from Gaza<br />by April 28th, as threats of ending the current<br />Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have been<br />ongoing for the last couple of weeks, under the<br />conditions of releasing hostages. Either way, only<br />2 weeks remain of this ceasefire. As we have seen<br />throughout the entirety of this conflict, it is<br />hard to predict what will happen on both sides,<br />however, I think it is not likely that the IDF<br />will completely withdraw","Emma Peterson (30%): I said 30% because the<br />first discussion of a negotiation happened<br />just recently, which has been the only known<br />conversation of an end to the war. However, the<br />conversation for this ceasefire did not include<br />Ukraine, one of the two countries involved in this<br />war. They have stated that a discussion over their<br />country will not happen without them, making me<br />assume a ceasefire will not be drafted by April<br />because Russia does not want to connect. Also,<br />most believe a ceasefire, if drafted, won’t last.<br />Trump has also announced he’d like a ceasefire by<br />April, but most are calling that unrealistic and<br />pushing the timeframe off to the end of the year<br />instead.","Emma Peterson (40%): I said 40% because I don't<br />believe Israel will completely remove forces from<br />Gaza by April 28th. The ceasefire is very unstable<br />as is, and articles are reporting that Israel<br />will end the agreement if Hamas doesn't return<br />all hostages. Hamas did return three hostages<br />yesterday, keeping the ceasefire in tact, however<br />IDF still remains in Gaza. I think eventually<br />there could be complete removal, however tensions<br />are too high as of now for a complete withdrawal,<br />and I don't believe it will happen by the end of<br />April.","Ethan Joyce (18%): The US and Russia have moved<br />ahead on peace talks without Ukraine! I feel like<br />that does not bode well for the peace process,<br />as Ukraine has preemptively rejected any peace<br />proposal that they are not actively involved<br />in building. Additionally, there doesn't seem<br />to be moves to include Ukraine in these talks<br />between the United States and Russia. The fact the<br />conversation is happening at all though indicates<br />some willingness from Russia to make concessions<br />to the US and or vice versa. \"I never intended to<br />yield to Russia's ultimatums and I don’t intend to<br />now\" -- Zelenskyy","Ethan Marcum (30%): As of late, there has not<br />been an agreement between Ukraine and Russia to go<br />through with a ceasefire; however, there has been<br />a recent stir that the United States and Russia<br />are having ongoing discussions of a ceasefire. The<br />issue is, Ukraine’s leader, President Zelenskyy,<br />is not too fond of these discussions occurring<br />without Ukrainian involvement. He feels that peace<br />can only happen with Ukrainian involvement. On the<br />other hand, U.S. Secretary of State, Marcio Rubio,<br />met with Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov,<br />to discuss further negotiations. This seems to be<br />irrelevant due to Ukraine’s lack of involvement.<br />Also, it has been seen that these recent meetings<br />were more so about building trust rather than<br />discussing specific plans for peace. The reason I<br />feel that the odds for a ceasefire are low is due<br />to the fact that there are differences of opinions<br />between leaders and the general lack of trust<br />regarding political objectives.","Ethan Marcum (25%): The IDF currently does not<br />seem to be worried about withdrawal, but more<br />so security. They are currently working with the<br />United States. They also are prepared to allow<br />those who are residents within Gaza to leave at<br />their own discretion, making me think they will<br />be staying for a while. President Trump seems to<br />want to rebuild Gaza, but with the aid of Israel.<br />If the IDF is to leave, I feel it will occur<br />after the semester ends. It does not seem probable<br />for now that the IDF is to leave soon. The main<br />concern is Hamas, and I do not see Hamas being<br />eradicated within 2 months.","Grace Mccann (10%): Putin said Russia would agree<br />to a ceasefire only if Ukraine handed over four<br />regions the Kremlin has declared part of Russia.<br />I think that it is unlikely for Ukraine to hand<br />over these territories especially because it would<br />push the narrative that Russia can bully them into<br />giving up territory which would probably cause<br />them to loose even more territory in the future.","Grace Mccann (40%): I put my likelihood on this<br />issue close to halfway because of how volatile it<br />is. I think that it is very likely it gets drawn<br />out even longer even though they have agreed to<br />a ceasefire. However Israeli forces withdrew from<br />the entire Netzarim Corridor in the central Gaza<br />Strip overnight Saturday-Sunday.","Grace Reichelderfer (12%): Although I could<br />see Russian and Ukraine coming to a ceasefire<br />agreement in the next year, I do not see it<br />happening in the next 2 months. Additionally,<br />it seems unlikely that Ukraine would agree to a<br />ceasefire without a guaranteed peace agreement.<br />President Zelensky seems unlikely to hold office<br />for much longer, which could lead to a ceasefire,<br />just not by April 28th.","Grace Reichelderfer (33%): A<br />hostages-and-prisoners exchange and armistice<br />to end the Gaza war were agreed to by Israel and<br />Hamas on 15 January 2025, and came into effect on<br />19 January. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio<br />was in Saudi Arabia on Monday as part of a tour of<br />the region that includes a focus on the ceasefire<br />between Israel and Hamas. I believe the ceasefire<br />could still be active, however, I do not think<br />that all troops will be out of Gaza by then.","Hampton Barrineau (10%): As long as Donald Trump<br />and Elon Musk are involved in negotiations, it<br />is highly unlikely that both sides will find a<br />resolution that they are willing to take. The<br />recent proposal is an example of this fact. Beyond<br />this, both nations. have the capacity to continue<br />the war until the weather gets strategically<br />worse, in the rainy season.","Hampton Barrineau (10%): A full withdrawal<br />from Gaza is highly unlikely given the<br />Israeli government. Netanyahu and his gang of<br />ultranationalists seem poised to at the least<br />occupy portions of the strip indefinitely much<br />like the West Bank. Short of America occupying<br />the territory (which won’t happen), Israel will<br />have troops overseeing the land to ensure its<br />“de-Hamas’ing”.","Hannah Carson (29%): I don't believe Russia and<br />Ukraine will not agree to a ceasefire before April<br />28th. I believe this because the markets predict<br />this will not happen. Additionally, US and Russia<br />are currently trying to negotiate a ceasefire.<br />However, Ukraine was not included in these<br />negotiations and is angry that they are not being<br />included. This lead Ukraine to state that they<br />will likely not agree to the ceasefire and that<br />they have several nonnegotiable territories they<br />must have. Russia has violated ceasefires with<br />Ukraine in the past so they will likely be more<br />skeptical to agree to a ceasefire again with them.","Hannah Carson (60%): I think the Israel/Palestine<br />war is about to come to an end. They are currently<br />settling ceasefire agreements and President Trump<br />has vowed to go into Gaza and help takeover.<br />However, I am unsure what the Gaza Strip will<br />look like post-war. The IDF could be in Gaza<br />helping with post-war governance depending on<br />what they decide about the ownership of the<br />strip. Additionally, they could still be there<br />to keep peace in the area. It could also be UN<br />peacekeepers doing this job so the only reason I<br />did not put the probability higher is that they<br />may be involved in the post-war structure in Gaza.","Isaac Fleischer (25%): The ceasefire deal reached<br />between Hamas and Israel calls for a complete<br />removal of Israeli forces by early March. Despite<br />this, Israel has maintained that if Hamas does not<br />release hostages by the agreed upon dates, they<br />will increase military presence in Gaza. It seems<br />unlikely that both Israel and Gaza will hold up<br />their ends of the deal and allow the ceasefire<br />agreement to resolve in accordance with the agreed<br />upon timeline. Though the IDF will likely withdraw<br />from Gaza relatively soon, this probably will not<br />happen before April 28.","Isabella Molina (33%): Given US Attempt to help<br />negotiate a ceasefire it does seem ceasefire<br />is likely to happen but not by the given date.<br />it's was unclear what it would take to end the<br />conflict. Ukraine and its European allies doubted<br />that a deal ensuring lasting security could be<br />made without Ukraine’s involvement.President<br />Zelenskyy made it clear that Ukraine would not<br />accept any agreement made between the U.S. and<br />Russia without its input.","Isabella Molina (38%): I’d say there’s about a<br />45% chance the IDF will be fully withdrawn from<br />Gaza by April 28, 2025. The ceasefire currently<br />seems slow and is focused on de escalation. Due to<br />this se factors the full removal will be a longer<br />process to ensure safety and cooperation. But with<br />ongoing negotiations and no firm public timeline,<br />it feels uncertain, but I see it as unlikely by<br />that given date.","Jacob Weiss (30%): There are ongoing talks between<br />Russia and the United States about a Ceasefire in<br />Ukraine. A key component missing in these talks<br />is actually Ukraine. Trump has continued to say<br />disinformation about Ukraine. Europe and Ukraine<br />are feeling more isolated than ever and Europe<br />will not do the policy of appeasement again.","Jacob Weiss (5%): There is very little chance that<br />the IDf will be pulled out of Gaza before April<br />the 28th. There has yet to be any realistic plan<br />to but into place that would be a day after plan<br />for Gaza. Israel will not allow the IDF to leave<br />unless the threat against it's civilians are gone.<br />The Ceasefire as it stands now is also extremely<br />fragile.","Jake Garrard (20%): Benjamin Netanyahu has<br />recently made the claim that Israel will not be<br />pulling the IDF out of Gaza until Hamas' military<br />and political capabilities have been completely<br />eliminated. As the cease fire draws on a solution<br />is becoming more of a necessity, but I do not<br />believe that the proper solution will be agreed<br />upon before April 28th.","Jenny Qiu (40%): Although Donald Trump has plans<br />to end the war by Easter and the US is reported<br />trying to talk with Russia to reach a deal (recent<br />meeting in Saudi Arabia), Ukraine has not been<br />invited to these talks and it has voiced that<br />it will not agree to any deals made without it.<br />Europe also warns Russia in case it violates a<br />ceasefire so I doubt Russia would agree to one<br />easily.","Jenny Qiu (5%): As the situation is now<br />deescalating due to the ceasefire and Hamas<br />hostages are being freed, the IDF has announced<br />withdrawal from several zones, one being the<br />Netzarim corridor. Residents of the Northern Gaza<br />Strip have thus been returning north from south<br />Gaza. The most important thing to note here is<br />the time frame. The IDF has so many semi-permanent<br />facilities set up in Gaza that require time to be<br />removed. Additionally, their withdrawal from Gaza<br />is expected to occur in stages, as Hamas releases<br />hostages periodically. I think it is incredibly<br />unlikely for them to be completely gone from Gaza<br />by April 28","Jerusalem Greenberg (60%): Russia and Ukraine,<br />while having no history during this war of working<br />things out, are in fierce talks as of the past<br />two months about starting a ceasefire or working<br />through Ukraine's peace plan. While Ukraine has<br />been largely left out of talks by the US and<br />Russia, I believe -- perhaps a bit optimistically<br />-- that because peace talks are one of the highest<br />priority discussions set aside in the EU's docket<br />for 2025, it will be prioritized and hopefully at<br />least worked into a ceasefire by April. Hopefully.","Jerusalem Greenberg (40%): I find it extremely<br />unlikely that the IDF will fully withdraw from<br />Gaza in the given time period. Even just six<br />days ago, the Israeli government came out with<br />a statement as they partially withdrew the<br />IDF from a specific sector of Gaza that a full<br />withdrawal would only be possible if Hamas's<br />military capabilities were completely destroyed<br />and there was no possibility of another attack,<br />but that won't happen in the next few months, if<br />at all. Not with so many countries in the middle<br />east supporting Hamas's efforts to protect the<br />Palestinians.","Jessy Lee (70%): There is no definitive indication<br />that Russia and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire<br />before April 28, but there have been developments<br />which lead me to believe there is a good chance<br />they will agree to a ceasefire. U.S. Secretary<br />of State Marco Rubio met with Russian Foreign<br />Minister Sergey Lavrov in Riyadh to explore the<br />possibility of a ceasefire in Ukraine, where the<br />Trump administration has set a goal of reaching<br />a peace agreement by Easter. There is speculation<br />surrounding a potential peace deal which has<br />sparked optimism about Europe's economic recovery,<br />with investors anticipating positive effects on<br />both markets and inflation which can also lead to<br />an agreement on ceasefire. While there are some<br />complications and considerations to be made, peace<br />looks to be in the future for the two.","Jessy Lee (40%): Given the nature of the situation<br />and the absence of a definitive timeline for<br />the IDF's complete withdrawal from Gaza, it<br />is unlikely that such a withdrawal will occur<br />by April 28, 2025. The process is expected<br />to be gradual, with ongoing negotiations and<br />developments influencing the exact schedule. We<br />are currently in the first phase which is supposed<br />to last for 42 days, while the agreements outlines<br />a 3-month plan. As dates are not set it could<br />take more or less time for the IDF to be fully<br />withdrawn from Gaza.","Joey Khashan (85%): With Peace negotiations<br />between Russia and the United States already<br />beginning, it is highly likely that we will see<br />a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine<br />before April 28th. The peace negotiations were<br />done without Ukraine at the table which may have<br />left a sour taste in Zelenskiy’s mouth, however,<br />I still believe that it is more likely than not<br />that Ukraine and Russia will accept the agreements<br />or at the very least create a ceasefire to better<br />relations before talks of peaceful coexistence<br />between the two nations.","Joey Khashan (20%): As of right now, Trump and<br />his administration believe that the best thing<br />for Gaza is good old-fashioned colonialization.<br />If that plan continues, it is highly unlikely that<br />the IDF will be pulled completely out of Gaza.<br />The conflict between Gaza and Israel has remained<br />an issue since mid-October of last year and while<br />ceasefires have been reached, I believe there<br />is a very low chance that IDF will be completely<br />removed by April 28.","Joshua Kang (15%): Although some talks have<br />started between the US and Russia, they have been<br />relatively unproductive, with Marco Rubio stating<br />there is \"nothing close\" to a framework even<br />having started yet. Ukraine is apprehensive of<br />these talks to them being omitted from them - any<br />terms made between the US and Russia that unfairly<br />impact Ukraine will likely cause refusal of terms<br />by Zelenskyy.","Joshua Kang (15%): With the conflict in Gaza being<br />accentuated by an extended ceasefire, there is<br />hope that the IDF may withdraw from Gaza, ending<br />the conflict. However, this seems unlikely. The<br />current ceasefire deal is still fraught with<br />fighting between the US, Israel, Hamas, and Arab<br />leaders - the hostages and Hamas prisoners set to<br />be released are still not released, postponing the<br />later stages of the planned ceasefire schedule.","Julia Loggins (30%): With Russia's violation of<br />past agreements as well as Ukraine insisting on<br />a complete withdrawal of Russia, I do not believe<br />Russia and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire<br />before April 28. There was a meeting with the US<br />and Russia in which Volodymyr Zelensky said he<br />would never accept Russia's ultimatums according<br />to the guardian. Ultimately, I feel as though<br />there are too many factors to 100% say yes or<br />no but with the current state I do not see a<br />ceasefire happening before April 28.","Julia Loggins (40%): Israel currently will not<br />completely withdraw till Hamas’s military and<br />political capabilities are gone and Hamas will<br />not hand over hostages until Israel removes<br />all its troops. Even though there has been some<br />withdrawal, there has been little progress in<br />negotiating the second phase, releasing all<br />hostages for complete IDF withdrawal. The first<br />phase is set to finish in March and the second<br />set in April but is contingent upon negotiations<br />and compliance. As of right now, I am uncertain if<br />the IDF will be completely withdrawn but I feel as<br />though they will not.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (33%): I believe that a ceasefire<br />agreement between Ukraine and Russia will not<br />be established before April 28th. President<br />Zelenskyy's unwavering stance on upholding<br />Ukraine's territorial integrity has proven to<br />delay the likelihood of such an event and I find<br />it unlikely to occur in such little time. I am<br />curious to see if Trump's efforts to pressure<br />Russia and Ukraine into ending the war will make a<br />very immediate impact on the matter.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (25%): I believe it is relatively<br />unlikely that the IDF will be completely withdrawn<br />from Gaza by April 28th. While a ceasefire<br />agreement has been reached, I imagine that Israel<br />may wish to keep some military presence in Gaza so<br />that Hamas cannot regain as much influence in the<br />region.","Kelsey Dyar (60%): Since Russia invaded Ukraine<br />nearly 3 years ago, there have not seemed to be<br />any real talks of ceasefire. However, Trump may<br />be speeding this process up. Last week he had a<br />phone call with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin,<br />and this week he met up with Russian leadership in<br />Saudi Arabia to talk about ceasefire negotiations.<br />Interestingly, Ukrainian leadership was left out<br />of these conversations. I chose 60% because while<br />it seems that Trump is ready to give Russia what<br />they want in order to stop the war, I do not think<br />the Ukrainian President will accept any terms that<br />he hasn't been able to negotiate and it seems like<br />he wants a seat at the table.","Kyle Smith (21%): With little to none negotiation<br />taking place, the chances of a ceasefire are slim.<br />There are still huge issues in the way of getting<br />to any crucial agreements between the nations.<br />There will be talks within Saudi Arabia on Putin<br />and the need for peace but Zelensky is worried he<br />will be left out of these discussions. I do see an<br />end in the war in the near future but i don't see<br />it as too likely by April 28th.","Kyle Smith (73%): The future discussions and<br />agreements should take place not only successfully<br />but also pretty soon. With the further research I<br />have done my probability of it happening increases<br />a semi-substantial amount. I would’ve given the<br />probability about a 60% chance but through further<br />research I would increase that amount by about<br />10-15%. Thus, the probability of the withdrawal<br />is about 70-75% for me as I see it happening more<br />likely than not.","Lawton Smith (75%): After this nearly three-year<br />conflict, including significant loss of life<br />and destruction, has created a strong focus for<br />both Ukraine and Russia to consider a ceasefire.<br />President Donald Trump's administration has made<br />ending the war a top priority, with Trump himself<br />initiating diplomatic efforts and phone calls with<br />both Putin and Zelenskyy to push for immediate<br />negotiations. Additionally, the United States has<br />begun to reduce its financial support to Ukraine,<br />with the suspension of foreign aid programs and<br />potential cuts in military assistance, which could<br />pressure Ukraine to seek a diplomatic solution.<br />( Also focusing on Ukraine to actually uphold its<br />\"democracy\" and have elections) This combination<br />of factors makes a ceasefire agreement more likely<br />in the near future, as both sides may be compelled<br />to negotiate due to war fatigue and changing<br />international support dynamics.","Lawton Smith (20%): Israel has repeatedly stated<br />that it will not fully withdraw until Hamas is<br />dismantled. This makes a total withdrawal by April<br />28 unlikely unless external pressure forces a<br />change in policy. We know Isreal has a very strong<br />and long history over this, and will likely not<br />budge. Even the ceasefire agreement, which took<br />effect on January 19, 2025, includes an initial<br />six-week phase focused on de-escalation efforts.<br />As part of the deal, Hamas is gradually releasing<br />hostages, while Israel is reciprocating by freeing<br />Palestinian detainees. This phased approach aims<br />to build confidence between the parties and lay<br />the groundwork for further negotiations, though<br />long-term stability remains uncertain amid ongoing<br />tensions. And given the history behind all of<br />this , I doubt we see something this fast.","Levi Thomas (30%): Though the U.S. has been<br />putting pressure on Ukraine and controls the<br />majority of its military aid, Ukraine has stated<br />that it will not accept any treaty unless it is<br />privy to negotiations. An alleged plan has been<br />constructed by the U.S. and Russia that involves<br />ousting Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a pro-Russia head<br />of state, but it seems both improbable and time<br />consuming.","Levi Thomas (10%): The current ceasefire is<br />standing on shaky ground as of right now. Israel<br />has neglected to provide the resources they<br />promised as part of their ceasefire conditions,<br />and this has prompted Hamas to cast doubt on<br />their ability to hold up their end of the bargain<br />if they do not receive these resources soon.<br />Furthermore, the second phase of the ceasefire<br />involves drafting a new governmental framework<br />for Gaza within a time frame that does not seem<br />sufficient. The significance behind this detail<br />is that Israel has not vowed to extend peace talks<br />if necessary, which means it could easily maintain<br />a military presence or easily restart conflict<br />on the grounds of having unmet deadlines. On top<br />of all of this there is also Trump's proposal to<br />have the United States remove all Palestinians<br />from Gaza. This plan, if carried out, would likely<br />involve IDF assistance. Furthermore, the mere<br />suggestion of Trump's planet the very least shows<br />Israel that the U.S. supports its actions, which<br />may embolden Israel to maintain an IDF presence in<br />Gaza.","Lillie Puhrmann (30%): A ceasefire between Russia<br />and Ukraine before April 28 is unlikely, estimated<br />at 30%. Ukrainian authorities criticized the<br />recent U.S.-Russia discussions in Riyadh for<br />not including Ukraine, raising questions about<br />Moscow's intentions. Ukraine sees these meetings<br />as Russia's ultimatums, not peace talks. Both<br />sides are firmly in their positions, with military<br />activities and mistrust. Some analysts believe<br />that any ceasefire could be temporary, with both<br />countries restocking their weaponry. Diplomatic<br />attempts are continuing, but deep-rooted tensions<br />and recent ceasefire violations make real peace<br />doubtful.","Lillie Puhrmann (22%): I believe of the IDF<br />fully withdrawing from Gaza by April 28 is low,<br />considering the current military and political<br />situations. The ceasefire agreement has a phased<br />withdrawal plan, but Israel's goal of dismantling<br />Hamas indicates that they might stay for a<br />longer time. Even though negotiations might<br />result in more withdrawals, the second phase is<br />still unclear. Also, the support from the U.S.<br />for Israel’s military approach and the internal<br />political pressures suggest that a quick complete<br />withdrawal is not very probable. Unless there are<br />major diplomatic breakthroughs, it seems unlikely<br />that a full exit will happen by late April.","Mabry Cartwright (35%): There was recently<br />a meeting between Marco Rubio and Russian<br />ambassadors discussing possible ceasefire<br />agreements, but Ukraine and surrounding European<br />countries were not participants. The Trump<br />administration and Russia have set forth a<br />plan that would have peace by Easter. However,<br />President Zelensky has made it clear that any<br />negotiation without Ukraine involved will not be<br />agreed upon. I believe this sidelining Ukraine<br />will postpone any progress. Also, certain<br />European countries have warned against accepting<br />a ceasefire agreement without a peace treaty.<br />With this being said, I believe there will be a<br />ceasefire agreement in 2025 but not before April.","Mabry Cartwright (40%): I believe the process of<br />the IDF withdrawing from Gaza will be a long and<br />strenuous process, so I do not believe that they<br />will be completely withdrawn by April 28th. They<br />have agreed to a ceasefire, and the terms include<br />withdrawal. An article by BBC stated that Israel<br />troops have been withdrawn from the corridor<br />between Gaza, but whether or not this happens is<br />still up for debate.","Margaret Pope (10%): Since the Trump<br />administration has been in office, they have<br />directed their negotiation for a ceasefire between<br />Ukraine and Russia solely at Russia. In order for<br />a ceasefire to be agreed upon, both sides must<br />have representation in the debate, and currently,<br />Ukraine has claimed they are being left out of<br />all negotiations. Currently, this ceasefire deal<br />is being treated as a US-Russia deal without the<br />input of Ukraine. Although Russia and the US are<br />much more powerful than Ukraine, I do not see them<br />agreeing to a ceasefire deal in which they are<br />kept in the dark about.","Margaret Pope (15%): The Israel-Hamas ceasefire<br />deal is extremely fragile, and it is not likely<br />that all of IDF will be withdrawn by April 28.<br />The ceasefire deal is set up in to three stages,<br />each lasting 42 days, so the April 28 deadline is<br />early in the final stage of the deal. The Trump<br />administration could also have a significant<br />impact in the deal, and Trump's allyship<br />to Netanyahu could be a concern for Hamas'<br />willingness to continue through with the ceasefire<br />deal.","Maston Corn (25%): Donald Trump reached out to<br />Putin to begin negotiations between Russia and<br />Ukraine for a ceasefire. These talks were held<br />in Saudi Arabia on the 18th and is the first<br />significant instance since the war started<br />that these countries were able to meet for a<br />negotiation. Both countries are said to have<br />agreed on 4 major principles. These principles<br />include restaffing the embassy's, appointing a<br />high-level team to conduct further negotiations,<br />economic and geopolitical cooperation, and<br />commitment for on-going talks. Although these are<br />signs that both countries are willing to cooperate<br />and may be working towards a ceasefire, there is a<br />lot to be done. Furthermore, Russia has said that<br />Ukraine not being allowed into NATO is not enough<br />to end the ceasefire, which means that there still<br />need to be much done to ensure the war is brought<br />to a close. It is unlikely that all of this will<br />be done by the end of April.","Maston Corn (30%): The IDF has been withdrawing<br />its troops from Gaza and has taken significant<br />steps to completely withdraw from the area. It is<br />likely that they will withdraw from many positions<br />in the Netzarim Corridor by April 28th. Although<br />this will mark a full military pushback, the IDF<br />will still remain in specific strategic areas in<br />Gaza and in the buffer zone near the border and<br />along the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza.<br />They will more likely than not remain in these<br />areas for quite some time so that they can monitor<br />the area and ensure security.","Meera Srinivasan (25%): As the 3-year anniversary<br />of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, both<br />sides have faced heavy losses, with Russia facing<br />especially heavy human losses. Since President<br />Trump’s ascension into office, the dynamic<br />between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States<br />has shifted dramatically, with President Trump<br />showing an increasing friendliness to Russia and<br />at times, criticizing Ukraine and blaming the<br />country for starting the war in a blatant denial<br />of facts. President Trump is highly motivated<br />to bring an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, but<br />I believe that the single factor of the American<br />president changing will not swing the chances of<br />a ceasefire in the complete other direction. Prior<br />to President Trump’s inauguration, I believed that<br />the Russia-Ukraine war would drag on for at least<br />another six months if not a full year, stopped<br />by human losses or arms shortages. Currently, I<br />believe a ceasefire is slightly more likely, but I<br />am not fully convinced that it is likely to happen<br />as soon as April.","Meera Srinivasan (35%): While the IDF has begun<br />to withdraw from some parts of Gaza, such as the<br />Netzarim corridor, Israel has stated it will not<br />agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until<br />Hamas’s military and political capabilities have<br />been eliminated. Israel has shown to repeatedly<br />violate ceasefire agreements, in the case of<br />the Palestinian territories as well as Lebanon.<br />Despite the terms requiring the IDF to be<br />withdrawn from Lebanon by January 26th, Israel has<br />refused to withdraw its military, pushing back the<br />date until February 18th while still continuing<br />to bomb areas of Lebanon. Similarly, Israel has<br />continued to violate the terms of the ceasefire<br />agreement in Gaza, which leads me to believe<br />that, like in Lebanon, withdrawal of the IDF will<br />be delayed in Gaza. Additionally, a great deal<br />of tension exists within the Israeli government,<br />which I believe has the chance of complicating a<br />full withdrawal of the IDF, given some ministers'<br />anti-ceasefire positions.","Mia Pisani (11%): The Russian-Ukrainian War began<br />February 24th, 2022, with Russia's invasion of<br />Ukraine on several fronts. As we approach the<br />third anniversary, tensions have not improved.<br />However, February 18th, 2025, the U.S. and Russia<br />have agreed to begin working towards an end to<br />the war. The U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio,<br />explained this is the only the beginning of a<br />conversation, and there is still much more work<br />needed. The United States and Russia expressed<br />three main goals in their conversation, including<br />staffing the embassies in Moscow and Washington<br />D.C., creating a team to foster Ukraine peace<br />talks, and explore economic cooperation and<br />relations. State department spokesperson, Tammy<br />Bruce explained that teams will \"begin working<br />on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine<br />as soon as possible in a way that is enduring,<br />sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\"<br />However, Ukrainian officials have been excluded<br />from such conversations, for the most part.<br />Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy explained<br />this conversations will yield no result without<br />his participation. Since the conversations have<br />just begun and Zelenskyy has been excluded, I find<br />it unlikely a ceasefire will happen anytime soon.","Mia Pisani (12%): A ceasefire between Israel<br />and Hamas was put into effect on January 19. The<br />deal has three stages, the first lasting 42 days.<br />The first stage states there will be a complete<br />ceasefire, Hamas will release 33 hostages in<br />regular intervals, Israel will release about<br />1,900 Palestinian prisoners, Israeli troops<br />will leave the Netzarim Corridor of Gaza, and<br />other conditions. With the evacuation of the<br />Netzarim Corridor, the IDF will remain at the<br />Philadelphi Corridor and other border areas.<br />During Stage Two, Israeli forces are expected<br />to completely withdraw and a permanent ceasefire<br />will be established. The final stage includes a<br />reconstruction of Gaza. However, President Trump<br />has also weighed in, claiming he plans on buying<br />and reconstructing Gaza. He expressed concern for<br />the hostages released by Hamas, saying they looked<br />like Holocaust survivors. Hostage conditions have<br />reportedly been deteriorating, as well. Israeli<br />officials have explained they will not remove<br />all troops until \"Hamas’ military and political<br />capabilities are eliminated\" per AP News. Hamas<br />will not free the hostages until Israeli forces<br />are evacuated. I do not find it likely Hamas<br />steps down, therefore they will not release<br />the hostages. This will cause Israeli troops to<br />continue to occupy Gaza.","Milan Yadav (60%): Russia and Ukraine are both<br />fighting a war in the Trump era, which is far<br />different in terms of foreign policy than prior<br />admins of POTUS. Trump has already stated a main<br />goal of his is to achieve a ceasefire by Easter.<br />Europe is being sidelined with this, as the US<br />is taking point since Europe has done very little<br />to quell the war up to now. As of very recently,<br />the US and Russia have begun peace talks in Saudi<br />Arabia as well. However, the issue is that Ukraine<br />will most likely not get more land from any<br />ceasefire agreement, which will inevitably delay<br />agreement from the country for now.","Milan Yadav (10%): As of a week ago, the IDF has<br />fully withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor of<br />Gaza. This corridor essentially split Gaza in 2<br />halves, so this is a major development. The main<br />motive of the IDF withdrawing troops from areas<br />is to save hostages, which the terrorists who<br />control Palestine have in custody. The ceasefire<br />from Jan. 19 is still ongoing but fragile, as<br />negotiations on both sides have been useless thus<br />far unfortunately. Until Hamas' \"military and<br />political capabilities are eradicated\", Israel<br />will not do a full withdrawal according to their<br />PM.","Nathaniel Long (66%): Recently, Marco Rubio<br />attended talks with his Russian counterpart,<br />Sergey Lavrov, who discussed plans for an end to<br />the Russia-Ukraine war. Rubio stated that these<br />meetings marked the beginning of a conversation<br />between the U.S. and Russia, and, while Ukraine<br />was not in attendance to these talks, sparking<br />some tensions in the Ukraine populations, it is<br />moderately likely that the U.S. now has enough of<br />a connection to Russia to organize some form of<br />ceasefire this year, if not before April 28th.","Nathaniel Long (40%): Being completely withdrawn<br />from Gaza would require the IDF to have<br />resolved/disengaged from all conflict in Gaza.<br />Recently, Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State,<br />met with Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu and<br />stated that Hamas 'must be eliminated' from Gaza,<br />implying that the U.S. would support further<br />encroachment into Gaza by the IDF.","Niomi Nurse (10%): News media outlets foresee<br />that there will not be a ceasefire between Russia<br />and Ukraine any time in the near future. Russia<br />is focused on expanding and reclaiming land they<br />believe to be theirs. Russia emphasizes that they<br />intend to ‘reclaim’ this land, even if it is my<br />force. There is also not much benefit to Russia<br />if they were to initiate a ceasefire deal with<br />Ukraine, as Russia is striving to meet their oil<br />quotas on Ukrainian land.","Pablo Martinez (45%): Israel and hamas has already<br />agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza which took effect<br />on January 19th. However that dosent mean the<br />conflict is over and the war still reigns on in<br />other parts in the region. However the ceasefire<br />in Gaza was the first step towards peace in the<br />region. Hamas still shows interest in continuing<br />ceasefire however with tensions still tight<br />between the two, especially a hostage situation<br />still upon us. We don’t know if there will be a<br />true ceasefire by April 28th but there seems to be<br />good steps torwards the right direction","Quintin Gallardo (35%): Over the past several<br />months, talks of a fire between Russia and Ukraine<br />have come about especially along Trump’s campaign<br />Trail in his 2024 election. Despite his promises<br />and work on the ceasefire between Israel and<br />Palestine, I still have doubts. this is because<br />the majority of his discussions have excluded<br />Ukraine, and only considered the opinions of<br />Russia, which I highly doubt that Ukraine would<br />agree to. Though I think it’s possible that in the<br />coming few months, there will be a cease-fire. I’m<br />leaning on the side of no, hence the 35 percent<br />chance.","Quintin Gallardo (30%): Despite the current<br />agreement of a ceasefire I find It unlikely<br />that the Israeli, dispense force will fully, and<br />completely remove itself from the region. This<br />is because despite the release of the hostages by<br />Hamas over the weekend which was a major point of<br />contention for the agreement, it is unlikely that<br />other incidents might not follow and for the IDF<br />to fully remove itself it would need solidified<br />evidence that Hamas will cease operations.","Rebecca Mcadam (20%): I think such a quick<br />agreement is very unlikely, given that the recent<br />discussions between Trump and Putin were had<br />without Zelensky. This is creating some skepticism<br />about who and what any ceasefire deals would<br />favor. Also, I think if anything, a peace deal may<br />arise before a ceasefire, since a ceasefire will<br />be difficult to negotiate due to uncertainty about<br />territory.","Rebecca Mcadam (15%): I think it is very unlikely<br />that all Israeli troops will be withdrawn from<br />Gaza in such a short amount of time. This is<br />because Hamas and Israel are at a standstill.<br />Hamas will not return refugees until Israel<br />removes troops from Gaza, but Israel will not<br />remove troops until Hamas completely gets rid of<br />their power in Gaza.","Riley Batz (38%): To determine the probability<br />of a ceasefire, we must first determine the<br />conditions of each country and whether these<br />conditions being met have a low or high<br />probability. Ukraine's leaders have said that<br />they will only agree to a ceasefire deal that<br />comes with security guarantees, such as European<br />peacekeeping forces on the ground, or NATO<br />membership. Zelensky has recently said that Europe<br />alone cannot guarantee Ukraine's safety, and the<br />security guarantees require cooperation from the<br />U.S. Though President Trump has said he wanted to<br />end the war in Ukraine, it does not seem like he<br />is willing to continue aiding them. On Tuesday,<br />Senior officials from Russia and the U.S. met in<br />Saudi Arabia to begin talks on improving ties and<br />negotiating ending the war- but the conversation<br />did not include Ukraine. Overall, it seems as<br />though Trump will make the U.S. work with Russia<br />to end the war, but not abide by Ukraine's terms.<br />Unless Ukraine folds on their conditions for a<br />ceasefire, I don't foresee it happening by April<br />28th- but the chances are not THAT low.","Riley Batz (30%): Currently, Israel is only<br />willing to withdraw its troops from Gaza<br />conditional on whether all hostages are returned.<br />This is in addition to Israel's statement that<br />they will not agree to a complete withdrawal<br />from Gaza until Hamas's military and political<br />capabilities have been eliminated. Netanyahu just<br />spoke with Trump this past weekend, and it did<br />not seem like peace was at the forefront of the<br />conversation. According to CBS News, Netanyahu<br />vows to \"open the gates of hell\" if all hostages<br />in Gaza not returned. I have doubts that this will<br />happen quickly given the recent political talk.<br />The probability of Israel removing all troops by<br />April 28th is not impossible- but low.","Ruby Douglas (15%): There have been no indications<br />of a definite ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine<br />before April 28th. However, recent records have<br />indicated that officials have been discussing the<br />possibility of a truce. It is also important to<br />note that a ceasefire without warning could cause<br />more harm than good. An alleged 3 stage peace plan<br />is supposed to be going into effect, and the plan<br />involves a truce following the Ukraine elections.<br />Because the Ukrainian president made a note that<br />Ukraine would not recognize any agreements made<br />without its participation, I think that April 28th<br />will be far too soon for both countries to agree<br />on a ceasefire. They both have high expectations<br />of what they would expect to come out of an<br />agreement and so I worry it is just too soon.","Sarah Joyce (40%): I am pretty uncertain about<br />what will happen between Russia and Ukraine.<br />Trump has been pushing for a ceasefire, and now<br />there is communication between Russia and the<br />US, but Ukraine and Europe have been cut out of<br />these negotiations. This seems counterintuitive<br />to creating a ceasefire that might actually be<br />accepted or last.","Sarah Joyce (10%): I think this is pretty unlikely<br />given that despite the ceasefire, tensions remain<br />high between Israel and Hamas. Israel has stated<br />that they will not completely withdraw from<br />Gaza until Hamas completely disbands, and it's<br />very unlikely that that will happen before April<br />28th. Additionally, both sides have already made<br />accusations toward the other for violating terms<br />of the ceasefire, so I feel like it is more likely<br />that the ceasefire will be broken at some point.","Senait Pirani (35%): The US and Russia have stated<br />that they are committed to ending the war, and<br />Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich<br />posted an alleged 3-stage peace proposal drawn<br />up by the two countries. The White House has not<br />commented on the plan, and Zelensky has repeatedly<br />said that any plans made without Ukraine's<br />involvement are \"meaningless,\" and that Ukraine<br />will not recognize any agreement made without<br />Ukraine's participation. I think the probability<br />that a peace agreement will be made is low, even<br />if talks have already begun, especially if Ukraine<br />is not being considered in these negotiations.","Senait Pirani (5%): A full IDF withdrawal<br />from Gaza by April 28 appears unlikely. Israel<br />maintains that its military presence is necessary<br />until Hamas is significantly weakened and hostages<br />are released. While partial withdrawals have<br />occurred, ongoing ceasefire negotiations remain<br />uncertain. Israeli leadership has also threatened<br />renewed operations if Hamas fails to comply with<br />demands. Even if a ceasefire holds, security<br />concerns and geopolitical pressures suggest Israel<br />will retain some level of control over Gaza beyond<br />April 28.","Sreya Pandyaram (17%): While Trump is confident<br />that a ceasefire will be reached by Easter,<br />recent tensions have arisen between Ukraine and<br />the United States due to Trump's exclusion of<br />Ukraine from discussions. However, it is clear<br />that Ukraine relies on the United States' support<br />to effectively prevent any future Russian attack.<br />Therefore, Ukraine may have to comply with Trump's<br />terms. Also there seems to be a misunderstanding<br />between Zelensky and Trump as a recent article<br />was just published where Zelensky says that the<br />president is stuck in a \"disinformation bubble\".<br />There's also a possibility that Zelensky could<br />be replaced due to Trump's political pressure,<br />currently it is reported that more than 50%<br />support the Ukrainian president.","Sreya Pandyaram (9%): The complete withdrawal<br />of the IDF is unlikely from the Gaza Strip, it<br />was announced that Hamas wants all troops out by<br />February 18, but this is more of threat/warning<br />rather than a ceasefire. And throughout history,<br />as well, when ceasefires were brokered while<br />there was a withdrawal depending on the conflict,<br />there was never a complete loss in the presence of<br />troops. Also a ceasefire depends on international<br />relations as well, and currently the relationship<br />between president Trump and Egypt is not well.<br />Ultimately while a ceasefire is present, it is<br />very tense as both Hamas and Israel accuse of each<br />other of violating the rules of the ceasefire, and<br />there is not a permanent solution.","Teya Hagy (20%): I do not think that Russia and<br />Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire before April<br />28th. I believe that their current conflict is<br />too rapid as of late. I do think that there is<br />a slight chance that Trump could influence an<br />agreement between the two countries, however the<br />conflict that has been increasing has been too<br />serious.","Teya Hagy (55%): I'm very unsure about this<br />question. I feel as if the IDF could be out of<br />Gaza completely soon. It helps that ceasefire<br />agreement started and they are no longer in<br />certain areas. However, it is hard to tell if they<br />won't come back and decide that the ceasefire was<br />a bad decision.","Thomas Smith (65%): I think it is possible that<br />a ceasefire before April 28th is agreed upon by<br />both nations. It has become increasingly clear<br />that Rubio's state department differs greatly<br />from Blinken's in the main aspect that Rubio and<br />the Trump administration want nothing to do with<br />Ukraine or foreign conflicts in general. Peace<br />talks have already begun in Saudi Arabia ,of all<br />places, notably excluding Ukraine from the table.<br />Ukraine remains adamant they will not accept<br />a deal brokered without them, but I think it's<br />far more possible both the U.S. and Russia, as<br />dominant powers, bully Ukraine into submission.<br />All sides want conflict to end and I think after<br />3 years of fighting and an estimated 1 million<br />casualties it's likely that an agreement is<br />reached soon.","Tiyanah Rowtham (18%): Furthermore, the “wisdom<br />of the crowd” theory assumes that a collective<br />opinion is better than one opinion. The theory<br />assumes that a large group of people are smarter<br />than individual experts. Using this method, I<br />assessed predictions made through Polymarket,<br />a predictions market used by millions of<br />subscribers. The question on this website was<br />“Russia x Ukraine Ceasefire in 2025?” The results<br />vary but the current probability stands at 72%.<br />Since the question extends through the end of<br />2025, it is reasonable to assume that if the time<br />frame were limited to April, the percentage would<br />be lower. Furthermore, I am confident that there<br />may be a peace agreement before the end of the<br />year that does not include a ceasefire agreement.<br />For these reasons, I am predicting that there is<br />an 18% chance that Ukraine and Russia will agree<br />to a ceasefire before April 28.","Tiyanah Rowtham (9%): Currently the IDF remains<br />in the West banking, citing security concerns. The<br />IDF completely withdrawing from Gaza depends on<br />renewed peace agreements, which have stalled for<br />years. I have no hope that the IDF will be fully<br />removed in the west bank by April 28 or ever.<br />Therefore, I put 9%","Townsend Turner (38%): Donald Trump as of a week<br />ago seems very confident that he has control<br />of Putin and the peace talks will commence<br />immediately. I am more skeptical, since Putin is<br />still asking for some pretty extensive terms, and<br />so is Ukraine, and they both refuse to budge thus<br />far. However, agreeing to a ceasefire is not all<br />the way to peace, so the obstacles and timeline<br />both are less for that.","Townsend Turner (36%): The ceasefire is moving<br />forward, though shakily. There could not be a<br />worse time to ask this question as currently<br />so many things are up in the air. In the next<br />few days, we should find out if there will be a<br />continuation of the ceasefire or hell on earth<br />in Gaza, to use Trump’s term. Honestly, I have no<br />clue but I’m skeptical.","Tristan Thompson (33%): President Trump says<br />that he would like a ceasefire agreement to be<br />met by Easter, I believe that he is being highly<br />optimistic. Neither Putin nor Zelensky are<br />going to submit to a ceasefire deal until their<br />conditions are met by the agreement, and I see a<br />low probability of this happening before the 28th<br />of April.","Tristan Thompson (34%): The current ceasefire<br />between the IDF and Hamas is shaky at best, while<br />things have seemed to be slowing down slightly,<br />the IDF has allegedly broken ceasefire agreements<br />which led to Hamas killing 3 cops in Gaza today.<br />Tensions still seem to be high and I do not<br />believe that the IDF will be fully withdrawn from<br />Gaza before April 28th.","Vangeli Tsiaras (55%): After tough negotiations<br />and conceding land, resources, supplies, etc.<br />(especially for Ukraine), it is possible that the<br />two countries, with the help of the USA, China,<br />the EU, and others, will agree to some ceasefire.<br />Recently, talks have been held with leaders such<br />as Trump and EU leaders to discuss the future of<br />Europe and the war. I think a ceasefire will be<br />pushed heavily by these large powers, and both<br />Russia and Ukraine will feel obliged to accept.","Vangeli Tsiaras (25%): The war in Gaza has been<br />one of uncertainty and extremely unpredictable<br />as it seems new developments on the war are<br />made every day. I think there will still be<br />some IDF troops in Gaza by April 28th because<br />of the ongoing conflict that does not seem like<br />it will end anytime soon. With a new American<br />administration that is staunchly pro-Israel and<br />claims they will help \"take over\" Gaza, I think it<br />is likely that Israel will keep a certain amount<br />of troops in the area. A complete withdrawal would<br />be against the interests of Netanyahu and his<br />goals for the region.","Wyatt Dasher (80%): I wrote a briefing detailing<br />why I have this storing of a brief. It truly is<br />a gut feeling that has little evidence to back<br />up why I feel this way. I think trump will get it<br />done and I can acknowledge that it may not be the<br />best way for me to make this prediction. Yet, as<br />we were told in class, tell the truth about how<br />you feel and I feel 80%.","Wyatt Dasher (10%): I have a friend who is taking<br />the Israel Palestine class and with that I am<br />hoping he knows more about the subject than I do.<br />So with that I am just trusting in my friend. He<br />believes that it's better for Israel to win the<br />conflict overall and just doesn't make political<br />sense.","Wyatt Stevenson (40%): Recently there has been<br />a lot of back and forth action with potential<br />ceasefire; however, there is still some<br />uncertainty. In middle of January there was some<br />conversation that were leading towards a promising<br />stop. At least there were not any exchanges of<br />hostages. However, briefly after the Israeli<br />president made remarks that would switch up the<br />momentum of the ceasefire, so it is uncertain<br />there will be a ceasefire.","James Martin (22%): I think there is a 22%<br />probability that Russia and Ukraine agree to a<br />ceasefire before April 28. Previous agreements,<br />like the Minsk Agreements have failed to produce<br />lasting peace. However the role of major powers<br />like the U.S and Europe can play a crucial role in<br />whichever way their stance is. They also have to<br />consider the public opinion, economic conditions,<br />and political stability when making an agreement<br />like this.","James Martin (75%): I think there is a 75%<br />probability that the IDF will be completely<br />withdrawn from Gaza on April 28. The IDF have<br />already begun a phased withdrawal from Gaza<br />as part of a hostage deal. As of now, they are<br />leaving a small amount to secure a corridor. While<br />there are still a small amount of the IDF in Gaza,<br />the process of removal is ongoing and aligns with<br />the framework of the hostage deal."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Russia and Ukraine<br />agree to a ceasefire<br />before April 28?","Will the IDF be<br />completely withdrawn from<br />Gaza on April 28?","Will UGA Basketball be in<br />the NCAA tournament?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Russia and Ukraine<br />agree to a ceasefire<br />before April 28?","Will the IDF be<br />completely withdrawn from<br />Gaza on April 28?","Will UGA Basketball be in<br />the NCAA tournament?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"44c4428237c5":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"44c4315244dc":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"44c4428237c5","visdat":{"44c4428237c5":["function (y) ","x"],"44c4315244dc":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I have looked through<br />Polymarket and probably 13 different articles, and<br />not a single one of them even gave Wicked the time<br />of day. Everything says Anora or Conclave will win<br />it. But I got screwed by the last award show so<br />I’m slightly hesitant to go any further down.","Andreas Papandreou (2%): I have no expertise in<br />this field at all, so I have turned to the media.<br />From all the reporting I have seen the movies<br />Conclave and Anora are the clear front runners to<br />win in this section. Additionally, the director<br />of Wicked was not nominated for the best director<br />section. Only 6 movies have won without their<br />director being nominated for best direction. This<br />makes it all seem like Wicked has a slim chance to<br />win the best picture nominee.","Andy Wyatt (2%): Despite the allure of Wicked, its<br />consistent pop culture presence since it debuted<br />on Broadway, and its die-hard fans, it has a more<br />than uphill battle for claiming Best Picture.<br />It has failed to garner any of the significant<br />precursor awards in the lead up to the Oscars,<br />casting massive doubt on its ability to pull<br />together a majority coalition to support it on<br />the Oscar ballot. The outside view of Jon M. Chu’s<br />absence from the Best Director nominations also<br />signals that voters are not considering the film<br />a serious contender for the top nod. While the box<br />office and critics adored the movie for its timely<br />political messages, cinematic quality surpasses a<br />film’s context.","Angela Jacobs (21%): Musicals rarely win in<br />this category, and while Wicked has strong brand<br />recognition, the Academy tends to favor dramas,<br />historical epics, or auteur-driven films. The last<br />musical to win Best Picture was The Artist (2011),<br />and before that, Chicago 2002), so the odds aren’t<br />in Wicked’s favor. However, if it lands with both<br />critics and audiences- it could surprise us. It<br />will likely have better victory in production<br />design, costumes, and possibly acting categories.","Anna Rachwalski (1%): There's no way, with Anora<br />and Conclave being obvious front-runners and the<br />Brutalist not far behind. In past film awards,<br />Wicked was even overtaken by Emilia Perez in the<br />musical category–if it can't win Best Musical, no<br />way it'll win best picture. 1% as I struggle with<br />straight down the line yes-or-no.","Ava Herring (35%): Although I love the movie so<br />much, I do not think that it has a strong chance<br />of winning this Oscar. This is only because<br />musicals do not typically do the best when it<br />comes to the Oscars, and apparently there is<br />some strong competition that they have to compete<br />against. The movies that they are running against<br />have strong critic backing, which could increase<br />their chances. Although I personally think that<br />Wicked deserves to win, realistically, I do not<br />know if that will be the case.","Bailey Mattox (25%): Historically, the films that<br />have won best picture are not the same ones that<br />have been popular among the public. Though Wicked,<br />was a good movie I think the Oscars will pick one<br />of the choices that is a more serious drama for<br />best picture, probably either Conclave or Anora.","Benjamin Jacobstein (2%): The Times says that<br />Anora will win best picture stating that \"Even<br />a conservative gambler would have to bet on<br />this riotous black comedy\". They stated that the<br />movie won Producers Guild Award which is highly<br />predictive of Oscars success, even though it<br />missed in two prior years. Betting odds do not<br />even have Wicked close to being a frontrunner<br />and DraftKings puts the odds of wicked winning at<br />+5000 or an implied probability of 1.96%.","Bennie Trujillano (20%): Of the nominated films,<br />I'd say about half have absolutely no chance<br />of winning. The big contenders will be Dune,<br />Anora, Conclave, Wicked, A Complete Unknown,<br />and maybe Substance. Assuming Mikey Madison wins<br />best actress which she probably will, then Anora<br />winning best picture is guaranteed. Wicked was<br />a fairly relevant film which is a factor when it<br />comes to determining a winner but it has so much<br />competition this year.","Brooke Cheney (16%): Wicked is one of 10 movies<br />up for this nomination. Based on the articles<br />I have read, there is no chatter about Wicked<br />being selected for this category. Anora seems to<br />be the front runner. One website cites the fact<br />that only 6 movies have won best picture without<br />a best director nomination.However, the movie has<br />done better than expected and did garner a lot of<br />attention. They even received 5 SAG awards, which<br />leads to me not being as sure.","Chinelo Ireh (12%): Wicked was one of the biggest<br />films of 2024 but popularity does not equate to<br />the Oscars Academy voting for it. Wicked is one<br />of the weakest films in this year's nominations<br />and there is little talk of it winning the award.<br />Other award shows like the Golden Globes or SAG<br />Awards have not recognized Wicked as one of the<br />best films of the year. Wicked won some Critics<br />Choice awards but they were all about technical<br />aspects such as costuming, production design, and<br />directing, but not best picture.","Chloe Cooper (1%): From every article I've read,<br />Anora seems to be the clear front runner in the<br />race for Best Picture this year. The film is up<br />for six nominations total and has already won best<br />picture at the DGA, PGA, WGA, and Critics Choice<br />awards. An article I read about predicting the<br />winners of the award also mentioned how Anora has<br />the support of the Screen Actors Guild which is<br />a main element of the best picture campaign. I<br />think it is very likely that Anora ends up taking<br />this award, and even if it does not, I don't think<br />Wicked has a chance. In every ranking I've seen,<br />people seem to believe Wicked is around the middle<br />of the pack in terms of likelihood of winning.<br />Other alternatives such as Anora, Conclave, and<br />The Brutalist seem to be the main contenders while<br />Wicked gets left in the dust.","Da In Song (30%): While Wicked was praised for<br />its plot, acting, and characters, Dune 2 received<br />more priase for its scenery, CGI, and costumes. In<br />terms of impact, the Brutalist received awards in<br />other places and Anora has received rave reviews.<br />Many fans predict the Brutalist. Considering all<br />thes split opinions, and the less favorable public<br />discourse towards Wicked, I predict 30%","Diane Johnson (35%): The movie has nine other<br />nominations meaning it is certain the movie will<br />have at least one Oscar but it is difficult for<br />a musical to win this title and is even more<br />difficult when the director of a movie is not<br />also nominated for an Oscar. I think that, despite<br />the praise surrounding this movie (largely due to<br />social media) it will get passed over similarly<br />to how it did during the Golden Globes. While I do<br />not think it will win in this category I would not<br />be too surprised if it did.","Eli Henderson (3%): Amongst pop-culture forums<br />containing opinions from fans and experts, it<br />would seem that the field for best picture this<br />year is relatively wide open, which may make<br />the chance that Wicked winning the coveted award<br />would be higher than it actually is. However, a<br />majority of betting markets have them winning at<br />less than 5% for the most part, given the presence<br />of Anora, Conclave, and The Brutalist. The volume<br />on most of these markets is heavy, therefore the<br />wisdom of the crowd should be taken into account.<br />Furthermore, the favored nominee, Anora, has<br />received countless honors from the Critics Choice<br />awards and the Screenwriters Guild awards, to name<br />a few, which make it more likely to take home the<br />best picture award.","Elliana Williams (15%): Most discussion forums<br />and predictiona articles favor Anora to win. It<br />is unlikely because Chu did not secure a \"best<br />director\" nomination, and there are better, more<br />\"deep\" musicals in the category. Though the film<br />was a wild success, it will not win the award.","Emma Allen (29%): Wicked is currently up against<br />9 other movies for the Oscars best picture award.<br />It is argued this year's ballot is extremely tough<br />with many sources predicting “Anora” and “The<br />Brutalist” on the top. Historically speaking,<br />there have only been 10 musicals to win this<br />award in the last 93 years. Additionally, only six<br />movies have been able to win best picture without<br />receiving a best director nomination, and Wicked<br />stands out as Jon M. Chu is not being considered<br />for best director.","Emma Pastor (25%): With all things considered, I<br />predict that the probability of the movie Wicked<br />winning Best Picture at the Oscars this year is<br />only about 25%. While I would estimate that the<br />probability that the film wins at least one of<br />the 10 categories for which it is being considered<br />to be higher than this, the specific category of<br />Best Picture seems less probable than others. As<br />many of the resources I found noted that in order<br />for Wicked to win this award, it would have to<br />essentially make history, joining the very small<br />number of winners in this category that were<br />musicals, and/or were not also nominated for best<br />director, a feat that is quite unlikely.","Emma Peterson (25%): I said 25% because Wicked has<br />a lot of hurdles to jump over to win this award,<br />and I personally think there are too many for them<br />to come out on top. Jon Chu, the director of the<br />film not being nominated for best director is one<br />of those hurdles. Only 6 in the past 96 years have<br />won without that director recognition. Another<br />being that musicals typically do not win in this<br />category. I think the frontrunners for this win<br />are Anora and Conclave.","Ethan Joyce (1%): With 5 million in volume, both<br />Polymarket and Kalshi predict Wicked has a less<br />than 1% chance of winning. Additionally, online<br />reviewers hardly mention the movie, especially<br />considering the large number of other films<br />competing for the award this year.","Ethan Marcum (10%): While it might win best screen<br />adaptation, it did not revolutionize the film<br />industry. It was a solid film, but many more have<br />higher odds and simply a better storyline and<br />acting. Anora will most likely win, simply due<br />to the fact that the acting was superb and the<br />storyline was unique.","Grace Mccann (30%): While wicked was a big box<br />office hit only 6 movies have won best picture<br />without their director being nominated for best<br />director wicked is nominated but the director<br />isn't which lowers their chances of winning. ABC<br />news is currently predicting conclave to win with<br />Anora as a close second.","Grace Reichelderfer (24%): For Wicked to win<br />Best Picture, it has to do something that only<br />6 movies have done in Oscars history. Only 6<br />movies have won Best Picture without a Best<br />Director nomination. While this does not rule<br />it out entirely, it does mean that Wicked's win<br />is less likely given the history of the award.<br />Because Best Picture incorporates so many aspects<br />of other categories, it does make sense that a<br />Best Director nomination as well as several other<br />nominations generally put a film in a better<br />position to win overall. Additionally, from the<br />predictions from various news sites, it seems<br />Wicked will not take home the award.","Hampton Barrineau (60%): This is very much a gut<br />feeling, but given Wicked’s cultural dominance as<br />compared to all the other films that is nominated<br />against and controversy over AI and the production<br />of films it is nominated against, I think there<br />is a decent chance that Academy voters will choose<br />the populist pick.","Hannah Carson (10%): I believe the chances are<br />extremely low that Wicked wins the Oscar for<br />Best Picture. The betting markets had Wicked<br />at a less than 1% chance they win best picture.<br />Additionally, every news article I saw said<br />either Anora or Conclave was going to win. Most<br />articles didn't even mention Wicked winning as a<br />possibility. Although Wicked is a widely popular<br />movie, it is not considered critically acclaimed<br />enough and lacks a best director nomination.<br />The only reason I put 10% is because I watched<br />the movie and thought it was outstanding! But<br />realistically, it is not gonna win the Oscar for<br />Best Picture.","Isaac Fleischer (3%): There are 10 nominees for<br />best picture in the 2025 Oscars. This means that<br />if every film has an equal chance of winning,<br />Wicked would have a 10% chance. However, on most<br />betting markets I could find, Wicked is listed at<br />around +5000 to win best picture (bet 100 to win<br />5000) and Anora is the favorite, at around -200<br />(bet 100 to win 50). Though I haven't seen any of<br />the nominated movies, from my research it seems<br />like Wicked has a roughly 3% chance of winning the<br />award.","Isabella Molina (35%): With a great cast, a great<br />director, and a great film, I fear that being a<br />musical may be the reason why it won’t win. The<br />Oscars have typically awarded Best Picture to<br />dramatic films rather than musicals. The last<br />time a musical won was back in 2004, I believe.<br />Also, Wicked is up against another film that has<br />been winning multiple awards in the same category.<br />Due to these factors, I give it a 35% chance that<br />Wicked will win the Oscar for Best Picture.","Jacob Weiss (5%): All betting odds and predictions<br />do not have wicked winning best picture. While<br />wicked is a film more people know of but the<br />smaller films that people don't know of can be<br />much better. The only reason why wicked would win<br />is due to its popularity but that's a long shot.","Jake Garrard (15%): Wicked, although receiving 10<br />different Oscar nominations this year, including<br />\"best supporting actress\" and \"best picture\", has<br />a very low likely hood of winning best picture.<br />In Oscar's history, only 6 movies have won an<br />Oscar for \"Best Picture\", without being nominated<br />for the \"Best Director\" award as well. This makes<br />sense, considering that to have the best film,<br />many other aspects of the film must be agreedly<br />the best as well. Although, the movie has been<br />obviously well received, the chances for it<br />to win \"Best Picture\" are very low without the<br />accompanying \"Best Director\" nomination.","Joey Khashan (10%): According to multiple sources,<br />Anora is the favorite to win Best Picture at the<br />Grammys and not Wicked. Wicked is ranked 6th on<br />projected winners and has between a 2% and 5%<br />chance of winning the award. For many of these<br />award ceremonies, it is usually a popularity<br />contest and considering the mass influence Wicked<br />had on pop culture, I think it is more likely that<br />they could win but still not likely.","Joshua Kang (30%): Historically, musicals have<br />not been very successful in winning Best Picture<br />for the Oscars - the most recent was in 2002, in<br />Chicago. It faces very stiff competition, such as<br />Anora and The Brutalist, one of two frontrunners<br />that are favored over Wicked. It seems the chances<br />are low for Wicked to claim the title.","Julia Loggins (5%): Ultimately, I do not believe<br />Wicked is going to win Best Picture. Key factors<br />including no nomination for Best Director as well<br />as others make the odds of winning Best Picture<br />slim. In addition, most if not all news sources<br />and prediction sites have Anora winning the title<br />of Best Picture. When taking a look at PolyMarket,<br />they also share the view of Anora winning Best<br />Picture with a 64% chance. On the other hand,<br />Wicked only has a less than 1% chance of winning<br />in that category with $3,259,000 placed on the<br />winner of best picture (Oscars: Best Picture,<br />n.d.). Although I want Wicked to win, I feel as<br />though the film’s chances are around 5%.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (0%): As a lover a movies myself,<br />I believe that an Oscar is rarely ever indicative<br />of a film's true artistic merit. However, I don't<br />believe that the Academy could be SO misguided as<br />to select Wicked for Best Picture at this year's<br />Oscars ceremony. I didn’t even need to see Wicked<br />to reach this conclusion. Wicked does not fit the<br />typical bill of \"Oscar bait\" nor does it seem to<br />achieve anything cinematically groundbreaking.<br />Over the past 20 years, only two Best Picture<br />winners have scored below 90% on Rotten Tomatoes<br />and Wicked stands at 88%, making its victory even<br />less likely. If Wicked wins Best Picture, may God<br />strike me down.","Kyle Smith (5%): Although it was nominated for<br />many grammys it most likely will not win best<br />picture. There are too many contending movies for<br />it to have a good chance this year.The academy<br />favors more critically acclaimed movies and the<br />chances are slim they will give it to a musical<br />film. With little research one can find the<br />fan favorites are currently “The Brutalist” and<br />“Anora”. Wicked only has 1% on polymarket and i<br />will subsequenlty give it a very low chance as<br />well.","Levi Thomas (6%): There have only been ten<br />musicals in the history of the Oscars that won<br />best picture, with the most recent being 2002’s<br />Chicago. This combined with the results of betting<br />markets makes it a long shot for Wicked to win<br />the award. Wicked also lacks the support from<br />other award shows that would be expected from a<br />contender for best picture.","Lillie Puhrmann (10%): Wicked is facing some<br />serious competition in the Best Picture category,<br />with leading contenders such as Anora and Conclave<br />taking the spotlight in expert predictions.<br />Even though its popularity and dedicated fans<br />help it stand out, musicals don't often take<br />home the award in this category. Also, the way<br />it's been received has been good, but it hasn't<br />quite matched the success of previous winners.<br />The betting odds and what people are saying in<br />the industry indicate that it's considered an<br />underdog, which means winning seems unlikely, but<br />it's not totally out of the question.","Mabry Cartwright (15%): Wicked is up for ten<br />different Oscar Nominations, including Best<br />Picture. However, I do not believe Wicked will<br />win in this category. The majority of predictions<br />I read claim that \"Anora\" or \"Conclave\" will win<br />(which is likely because both have already won<br />numerous awards). Wicked ranked last on potential<br />winners of one prediction. I do believe wicked has<br />a high chance of winning Best Production design<br />or Best Costume Design, but feel quite certain it<br />will not win Best Picture.","Margaret Pope (37%): Although Wicked was a<br />well done movie and did well in the blockbuster<br />realm, I do not think it will win best picture<br />at the Oscars. The other films that are up for<br />the category are also extremely well done, and I<br />believe that Wicked's lack of screen writing and<br />original concept may hinder their ability to win.<br />However, Wicked is a well known musical and the<br />movie rendition was very well done.","Maston Corn (12%): Wicked has been nominated for<br />multiple categories including Best Picture, Best<br />Film Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume<br />Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Original<br />Score, Best Sound, and Best Visual Effects. It<br />was a film that has been praised and held in<br />high regard as one of the best films of the year.<br />However, in the category of Best Picture, there<br />are multiple films that are predicted to have a<br />much higher chance of winning before Wicked. Out<br />of the 10 movies nominated, 7 movies have been<br />predicted to have a better chance of winning than<br />Wicked. The film \"Anora\" seems like a certain<br />winner for this category.","Meera Srinivasan (35%): Wicked has secured 10<br />nominations at the Oscars, one among them being<br />Best Picture. However, many critics have drawn<br />attention to the fact that only six movies have<br />won Best Picture without the director being<br />nominated for Best Director. Director Jon M. Chu<br />has not received a Best Director nomination, but<br />this does not entirely rule out the possibility of<br />Wicked winning Best Picture.","Mia Pisani (28%): Wicked has been nominated for<br />10 Oscars, generated high reviews, and earned<br />over $700 million in box office sales as of<br />January. However, I find it unlikely Wicked<br />wins the Oscar for Best Picture. Historically,<br />musicals do not often win Best Picture, as only<br />10 have done so, the last being in 2002. Per \"The<br />Hollywood Reporter,\" \"Anora\" is projected to win<br />Best Picture, primarily due to \"Critics Choice,<br />Producers Guild, and Directors Guild honors.\"<br />\"Conclave\" earned high honors at BAFTA and SAG.<br />Other nominees, such as \"The Brutalist\" have won<br />a plethora of awards. Additionally, a second part<br />to \"Wicked\" is set to come out, which may make its<br />chances even lower this year.","Milan Yadav (17%): Musicals usually do not win<br />many Oscars, with the last one being in 2002. The<br />Oscars generally favors dramas and traditional<br />releases. Also, Wicked is coming out with its<br />second half soon which will most likely hamper<br />the first half being up for some Oscars. However,<br />Wicked's very unique story and inspirational<br />messages are hard to ignore. Also, only 6 movies<br />have won Best Picture without a Best Director<br />nomination... so Wicked doing this would take a<br />lot.....","Pablo Martinez (5%): There are many movies<br />nominated this year for best Oscar picture.<br />Wicked, however, falls into a weird category,<br />being a musical. Although there were many great<br />things I heard about the movie, nothing screamed<br />to me \"movie of the year.\" When I hear \"movie of<br />the year,\" I think of Dune, Anora, and Conclave.<br />The last musical to win best picture at the Oscars<br />was Chicago (2003). To all the girls who watched<br />this and said \"absolute cinema its gonna win best<br />picture\" prepared to be disappointed.","Quintin Gallardo (41%): In order for wicked to win<br />best picture they would need to accomplish a feat<br />that only six films have done in the past. They<br />would need to win the award without simultaneously<br />winning the Oscar for best Director. While looking<br />at the list of contenders, it does seem apparent<br />that wicked is only one of two recognizable<br />movies. With this being said, I think the chances<br />are elevated, but there’s still the factor<br />that they must overcome. Altogether, I’d put it<br />collective chance as moderately low.","Rebecca Mcadam (20%): Although Wicked was a global<br />phenomenon as a movie, I don't think it is very<br />likely that it will win for best picture. This<br />assumption is according to prediction markets,<br />which have Wicked nearly out of the running for<br />best picture. There is a 67 percent chance that<br />Anora will win, and I am confident that it will<br />win.","Riley Batz (18%): In 93 years, 10 musical adaption<br />films have won best picture, with the last winner<br />being Chicago in 2003. Overall, this is a winning<br />rate of 10% for musical adaptation films, which<br />is not a high rate. Additionally, Wicked does<br />not have a nomination for best director. This<br />statistic is relevant because the winner of best<br />director is largely associated with the winner of<br />best picture. Historically, only 6 movies have won<br />best picture without a best director nomination-<br />only 6.25%. Lastly, we have to take into account<br />that Wicked Part 2 will be released this upcoming<br />November. I find it hard to believe Part 1 will<br />get the big best picture award when there is still<br />content remaining, and if Wicked were to ever win<br />best picture, I think that award is more likely<br />to come next year. Though my baseline prediction<br />was 10%, my final is 18% because of Wicked’s<br />exceptional popularity giving it a slight edge.","Ruby Douglas (10%): Overall, when I read the<br />predictions on the 2025 Oscars it seems that<br />Wicked has a less and less chance of winning Best<br />Picture. I’m biased because of my own personal<br />love for the film, but I certainly think it<br />is one of the best movies of our time. The 3<br />hour long movie captures everything that these<br />blockbusters aim to capture. However, I think<br />that the movie will fall short of winning Best<br />Picture. In general, while Wicked was a HUGE<br />movie, the academy is looking for movies that push<br />the threshold and can be considered epic. I think<br />because of the fact that Wicked is technically an<br />adapted version of a broadway play, and it’s depth<br />doesn’t necessarily stack up to it’s competitors,<br />it will end up falling short of Best Picture. My<br />fingers are CROSSED for Cynthia!","Sarah Joyce (5%): The likelihood of Wicked winning<br />Best Picture is very low, considering it has<br />not been included in many of the conversations<br />surrounding likely winners. Additionally, other<br />award ceremonies tend to be pretty good indicators<br />of the direction the voters might be leaning,<br />and Wicked has not won any of the top awards at<br />these ceremonies. Also, a musical has not won Best<br />Picture at the Oscars since 2003, which makes it<br />more unlikely that Wicked will be the one to break<br />that streak.","Senait Pirani (33%): The Academy tends to favor<br />dramas for Best Picture, with the last musical to<br />win in that category being in 2003. Additionally,<br />only 6 films have won Best Picture without also<br />having a Best Director nomination. While this<br />doesn’t rule out Wicked entirely, it makes their<br />chances of winning less likely given the history<br />of the award.","Sreya Pandyaram (6%): Wicked is not likely to win<br />Best Picture because throughout the award season<br />it has not won any of the major categories that<br />could predetermine a win in those same categories<br />at the Oscars, which would have then lead to<br />the Best Picture prize. While there are chances<br />under a subjective lens, logically, it is very<br />unlikely. In fact many major news outlets don't<br />even consider Wicked a serious contender anymore.<br />Wicked could win in technical categories and then<br />win the Best Picture, but only one musical has<br />done that before and it was in the 50s. This was<br />more likely then as musicals were a popular genre.","Teya Hagy (85%): I believe that the picture Wicked<br />will win the oscar for best picture because of<br />the astounding reviews that it has gotten over<br />the past couple of months. I have not seen a movie<br />that has gotten reviews like this since Barbie.<br />I think that the biggest competitor would be Dune<br />Part 2. However, I do not think that they will<br />win.","Thomas Smith (4%): The last musical to win best<br />picture was Chicago (2002). In the 1930s 1 in<br />10 movies produced were musicals. Today that<br />number is less than 1%. Only 10 musicals have<br />ever won best picture. If we follow this trend<br />proportionally overtime it is highly unlikely for<br />Wicked to win best picture. Also their are several<br />more favored films such as A Complete Unknown and<br />The Brutalist.","Tiyanah Rowtham (5%): “Wicked” is among the ten<br />films nominated for Best Picture at the upcoming<br />97th Academy Awards. According to the Houston<br />Chronicle Oscar predictions, “Anora” and “The<br />Brutalist” have a better chance of winning Best<br />Picture. For these reasons, I think Wicked has a<br />5% chance of winning.","Townsend Turner (28%): I was rather convinced<br />that Wicked would win, simply because it was the<br />movie I knew on the list, while I did not know any<br />of the others. However, after reading an article<br />utilizing a mathematical model to predict the<br />probabilities of each candidate. Based on other<br />wins from other awards, Anora is most likely to<br />win based on that model and I’d have to agree.<br />The others following behind Anora are not Wicked<br />until you get to number 4 or 5 but its popularity<br />from my understanding has me giving it a higher<br />probability than that model regardless.","Tristan Thompson (39%): There are some heavy<br />hitters that are in contention for the Oscar for<br />Best Picture. Betting odds do not even have Wicked<br />in the top 4 to win best picture at the time of<br />this prediction, making it seem unlikely. Other<br />films of its kind have won in the past, and it<br />most certainly possible that it could win this<br />time, but I give the edge to the other films on<br />the ballot.","Vangeli Tsiaras (5%): Due to its great reviews and<br />high popularity, Wicked could win an Oscar this<br />year, but I strongly believe it will not win Best<br />Picture. Most people, such as film critics, movie<br />or Oscar reviewers, entertainment news sources<br />(like Variety and the Hollywood Reporter), and the<br />audience in general, also widely believe that it<br />will not win Best Picture either. Other movies,<br />such as Anora and Conclave, are more probable<br />choices to win the Oscar.","Wyatt Dasher (2%): The betting odds when you<br />combine all the odds seem to be at about 2%.<br />While it has trending songs it seems to lack when<br />compared to Anora which is favored to win with a<br />67% chance. All the info points to that it will<br />not win.

Taking into<br />account other factors such as recent remarks<br />made from officials from the Federal Reserve and<br />other economic criteria. There are many elements<br />that play a huge role in my reasoning behind<br />this prediction. Such as recent projections and<br />decisions made by the Federal Reserve are strongly<br />considered.","Addisen Kameron (85%): 85% Everything I see seems<br />to think that the interest rates will stay the<br />same. I know nothing about economics so I’m really<br />just running with what the internet experts say on<br />this one. Forbes, Polymarket, and an NBC article I<br />read made me pretty confident nothing will change<br />soooo hopefully they’re right","Andy Wyatt (95%): Interest rates are very unlikely<br />to change at the March meeting because the<br />Consumer Price Index (i.e. inflation) has hovered<br />at 3%, above the Fed’s 2% target, and the job<br />market’s continued robustness. The CPI has been<br />rising since September. Similarly, unemployment<br />is on the decline, standing at 4% currently. At<br />the Fed’s last meeting, the minutes revealed a<br />unanimous decision to leave rates unchanged due<br />to economic conditions and uncertainty surrounding<br />the impacts of the new administration’s policies.<br />This information complements the CME Group’s<br />FedWatch Tool, based on Fed Funds futures prices,<br />indicating a 97.5% chance rates remain unchanged.","Angela Jacobs (84%): The Consumer Price Index<br />(CPI) has shown inflation slowing somewhat in<br />recent months, but it remains above the Fed's<br />target of 2%. The Fed has already raised rates<br />significantly in recent months. With the effects<br />of these hikes likely still working through<br />the economy, the Fed may prefer to pause and<br />assess their full impact before making further<br />adjustments. Additionally, The risk of a recession<br />is a wildcard. The Fed is likely cautious about<br />pushing the economy into a downturn by tightening<br />too aggressively, especially if growth continues<br />to decelerate. Also, if a majority of traders<br />are pricing in no rate change for March, this<br />can influence the Fed's own decision-making. A<br />pause could signal confidence that inflation is<br />under control, but also caution about further<br />tightening.","Anna Rachwalski (90%): As of Friday, February<br />12th, Kalshi has a volume of over $15 million<br />and is 96% certain that there will be no change.<br />Polymarket also has a 96% certainty, with $17<br />million on this probability. Based on general<br />market conditions, the attitude coming from the<br />Fed itself, and the extremely large market value<br />on there being no change in the Federal Funds<br />rate, I am going to go with the crowd and give<br />it a 90% chance that interest rates will not<br />increase. The economy vaguely seems to be headed<br />in the correct direction, and the Fed will not<br />want to over-adjust and cause more shocks.","Archita Gaur (80%): Interest rates are probably<br />going to remain unchanged because the jobs<br />market seems fine and the inflation rate is still<br />slightly above target. Most economists don’t<br />predict the interest rates changing at all at the<br />March meeting. The federal government had also<br />already signaled that it expected fewer cuts in<br />2025 in December of last year.","Ava Herring (80%): I believe that there is a<br />strong chance that the Federal Reserve will not<br />change the interest rates due to a few reasons.<br />One, according to the FOMC, they have shown that a<br />change in the rate cuts before mid-2025 is pretty<br />unlikely. The current economic status has also<br />shown that there is a lack of urgency for cuts<br />due to the strong labor market as well as high<br />inflation. The CME Fedwatch also gives an 81.7% of<br />no change.","Ayaan Fazal (95%): Based off a recent study and<br />poll performed by economists, it seems almost<br />certain that the United States will not lower<br />interest rates.The Federal Reserve has maintained<br />the federal funds rate at 4.25% to 4.50% as<br />of January 2025, highlighting the need for<br />more substantial progress on inflation before<br />considering rate reductions.","Bailey Mattox (75%): Honestly, I know nothing<br />about the economy. In general, the Federal Reserve<br />seems a little more likely to hold rates steady<br />than to change them. I don't think there is enough<br />evidence pointing to any significant economic<br />change that would indicate they would change the<br />rates so I think the rates will stay the same.","Benjamin Jacobstein (69%): While markets<br />strongly expect the Fed to hold rates steady,<br />uncertainty remains due to inflation trends,<br />labor market shifts, and global economic factors.<br />Current betting odds on Kalshi (95%) suggest<br />near certainty, but historical Fed behavior and<br />ongoing changes everyday in our economy lower my<br />confidence a bit, which is why I am choosing 69%.","Bennie Trujillano (95%): Federal interest rates<br />are currently high, and I expect them to stay that<br />way as inflation is only worsening. From what I've<br />found, most sources also doubt that there will be<br />any change to interest rates at the March meeting.<br />There is also a high volume poll on Polymarket<br />that supports this (No Change at 96.8).","Brooke Cheney (92%): The FED has dropped rates by<br />a basis point in the span of 4 months in 2024. The<br />FED did not start decreasing rates until inflation<br />hit 2.4% in September 2024. Now that inflation<br />has jumped up to 3% as of January 2025, I find it<br />highly unlikely for them to cut rates, especially<br />since they did not in June 2024 when inflation<br />was at 3%. I also find it unlikely for them to<br />increase rates, though I believe it is more likely<br />than them decreasing rates. The FED knows it takes<br />ample time for the markets and economy to fully<br />feel the effects of rate changes, so I believe<br />they will want to keep it constant until they know<br />more information. The only caveat of course is if<br />some unexpected event happens.","Chinelo Ireh (72%): For the past 24 months,<br />the US Federal Reserve has changed the interest<br />rate in either direction at every meeting. Since<br />September, the Fed has cut interest rates. Despite<br />all of the discourse surrounding President Trump’s<br />potential trade wars, Chairman Powell made it<br />clear on January 29 that the Federal Reserve will<br />keep rates steady for the first half of the year.<br />It is unlikely that the rates will change at the<br />March meeting because it is too early to detect<br />the real changes that could come from any tariff<br />policy changes.","Chloe Cooper (97%): Every article I've seen seems<br />to believe that the Fed will elect to hold off<br />on adjusting the interests rates at least until<br />their next meeting in May. News outlets like CBS<br />News and Forbes are saying that many economists<br />believe that this is the most likely outcome, and<br />that the Fed wants to watch and wait before making<br />any sort of move. All betting markets on this<br />subject are also heavily skewed in the favor of no<br />change, with both Kalshi and Polymarket having the<br />likelihood of no change occurring at over 95%. In<br />my research I've seen nothing to suggest that they<br />will change the rates, so I'd say the likelihood<br />of this happening is almost certain.","Da In Song (80%): The Fed will have to move<br />accordingly to Trump's tariffs and the inflation<br />his policies might cause. Whether there will be<br />a rebound (Trump lowering or walking back on his<br />promises) is debateable, but the some tariffs<br />have already been put into place. The most recent<br />news about Elon Musk's interest in auditing the<br />Fed Reserve might also impact their decision, but<br />whether it will be in a positive or negative light<br />is uncertain. The cut may be small, considering<br />the fact that the economy is supposedly \"on<br />track\" with a 2% inflation and a low unemployment<br />rate, but they will have to make a decision that<br />reflects Trump's policies.","Diane Johnson (87%): Federal Reserve workers are<br />highly hesitant to change interest rates anytime<br />soon because of the delicateness of inflation<br />in the U.S. After recently changing the interest<br />rate in January 2025, most employees think that<br />it is too soon to change it, despite Trump’s<br />inclinations. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal<br />Reserve of the United States, has been very<br />outspoken about lying in wait to see how “tariffs…<br />immigration…fiscal policy and…regulatory policy”<br />will impact buying and spending to react publicly<br />with either raising or lowering the interest<br />rates.","Eli Henderson (87%): In a recent Forbes article,<br />followed by several other supporting pieces from<br />financial publications, it has been revealed<br />that the FED won't be cutting interest rates in<br />their March meeting. While this only addresses<br />interest rates in terms of slashing the rates,<br />the conditions under which the FED would raise<br />interest rates are likely to be absent. This is<br />because, as it stands, inflation is rising, but<br />not at an unprecedented amount, which would lead<br />to an increase. Furthermore, the job market is<br />either growing or remaining stable in most areas<br />throughout the country, which is also one of the<br />main indicators of the necessity of rate changes.<br />Barring a large increase in inflation, rates will<br />remain unchanged until later in 2025 at the least.","Emma Allen (84%): Sources, recently updated,<br />show the Federal Open Market Committee is not<br />expected to change interest rates on March 19<br />mainly because “the jobs market appears robust and<br />inflation remains above target and accelerating<br />slightly” (forbes.com). Based on January 2025<br />data, inflation is running closer to 3% than the<br />desired target of 2%, so I think even the slightly<br />higher interest rate alone will cause the Federal<br />Reserve to hold interest rates at higher levels<br />and remain where they are at.","Emma Pastor (60%): At the Federal Reserve's last<br />meeting in January, they made the decision to hold<br />interest rates steady. This followed 3 previous<br />meeting where rates were cut, signaling a plateau<br />for the federal interest rates. Because of these<br />back to back cuts for multiple meetings, I feel<br />like like it is likely that we will see them<br />continue to hold these rates steady in their March<br />meeting.","Emma Peterson (75%): I said 75% because when<br />researching, I found that the Federal Reserve<br />kept the interest rates unchanged at their January<br />meeting. While cuts are still expected this year,<br />it's not promising for the March meeting. Most<br />sources are predicting they will once again leave<br />interest rates unchanged. I personally don't<br />know much about the federal reserve, so the basis<br />of my prediction resides with what has happened<br />previously and it's pushing me to believe the<br />rates will remain unchanged for the time being.","Ethan Joyce (95%): The Fed has a cautious approach<br />to rate cuts. In the most recent FOMC meeting,<br />officials emphasized that while unemployment<br />shows signs of leveling out they are still<br />focused on ensuring further inflation reduction.<br />This means they probably aren't inclined to make<br />any premature rate cuts. Kalshi and Polymarket<br />odds reflect this outlook, with traders largely<br />expecting a steady rate environment rather than<br />cuts.","Ethan Marcum (90%): The Federal Reserve officials<br />have stated that due to uncertainty with the<br />market, that they are likely to not change<br />interest rates. They want to see what the market<br />will do on its' own. On the other hand, Trump is<br />not a fan of this, so it could change; however,<br />most experts are not expecting a change this soon.","Grace Mccann (85%): Prior to the January meeting<br />a Factset poll showed the 90% of economists think<br />that the fed will hold steady on rates and that<br />did happen and the same poll shows the same thing<br />for this meeting. Most analysts now expect that<br />the earliest opportunity for the first benchmark<br />rate cut of 2025 would be the May Fed meeting.","Grace Reichelderfer (87%): The Federal Open Market<br />Committee is not expected to change interest<br />rates on March 19. That’s because the jobs market<br />appears robust and inflation remains above target<br />and accelerating slightly. Recent economic data<br />has supported the FOMC holding rates steady. The<br />jobs market has continue to show momentum. That<br />means there’s little impetus for interest rate<br />cuts to support job growth.","Hampton Barrineau (85%): Lowering rates at this<br />time seem highly unlikely and furthermore raising<br />rates would be take a lot of political capital<br />that would only further put the fed in the<br />crosshairs of the Trump Administration. I see the<br />news and early briefings suggest no change too.","Hannah Carson (90%): I am very confident the<br />US Federal reserve will keep its interest rates<br />unchanged at its March meeting. First, they just<br />changed interest rates in December so they are<br />likely going to wait a while until they change<br />them again. Additionally, the federal reserve<br />will likely need more progress on inflation before<br />cutting rates and the US job market is currently<br />strong. Both these factors lead me to believe the<br />interest rates will stay the same. I looked at<br />the betting markets and most betting markets put<br />over a 90% chance of the interest rates staying<br />unchanged during the March meeting.","Isaac Fleischer (75%): The inflation rate has not<br />increased significantly since the last time the<br />Fed met to discuss interest rate. It seems as if<br />the fed is comfortably leaving interest rates as<br />they are so as to not negatively influence the Job<br />market or other economic factors.","Isabella Molina (80%): I think the probability<br />of the US Federal Reserve keeping interest rates<br />unchanged in March is about 80%. The Fed has<br />recently kept rates steady and suggested only<br />modest cuts in 2025. Due to my research it does<br />seem the market is not going to make any changes.<br />So, based on this, I’d say the chances are high<br />they’ll leave rates as is.","Jacob Weiss (95%): There is little to no chance<br />that the rates will change. The fed believes the<br />economy is relatively good right now and fear that<br />making any changes will damage the economy going<br />forward. Multiple news outlets are saying that<br />changes are going to be held off until May.","Jake Garrard (38%): It is not expected for a<br />change to the interest rates to be cut or changed<br />at all in the March meeting, while there is still<br />plenty of time for that to change, at this moment<br />it seems unlikely. Considering there is still<br />some time for things to occur, I am only slightly<br />confident that no changes will be made at 38%,<br />however i believe no change occurring is more<br />likely than not.","Jenny Qiu (80%): The Federal Reserve Chairman<br />expressed in January that they will be keeping the<br />federal interest rate steady (4.25-4.50%) in order<br />to reduce inflation. Due to the policies Donald<br />Trump enacted, inflation is expected to increase<br />but the reserve wants to bring down inflation<br />to 2%. If they were to reduce interest rates, it<br />would cause more inflation. Some experts predict<br />the interest rate will remain steady until May. I<br />put 80% because there's a chance the interest rate<br />changes between the 0.25% range.","Jerusalem Greenberg (70%): Most market predictions<br />have estimated (as soon as 12 hours ago) that<br />interest rates will not change in the March 19th<br />meeting. I trust the general public, as well as<br />the testimony from February 20th, in which Adrien<br />Kugler said that they trust the decision made in<br />January. Though cuts are expected in 2025, it’s<br />unlikely that they’ll happen in March. Projections<br />predict they won’t happen til the summer.","Jessy Lee (85%): I do not expect to maintain<br />the current interest rate at its next March 19th<br />meeting. Recent remarks from Federal Reserve<br />officials suggest a careful stance on rate cuts,<br />with no immediate plans for reductions. Atlanta<br />Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic has<br />anticipated two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts<br />in 2025 but recognizes considerable uncertainty<br />due to factors like trade and immigration<br />policies. The Federal Reserve also wants to see<br />further progress on inflation before cutting<br />interest rates. With policy changes from Trump's<br />administration, I see the uncertainty being<br />another reason to wait.","Joey Khashan (85%): The US Federal Reserve will<br />decide to keep interest rates unchanged at its<br />March meeting. According to several sources, the<br />Fed is expecting to make 2 rate cuts this year<br />instead of their originally projected 4. After<br />suffering some financial setbacks after making<br />their third consecutive cut in December, it is<br />likely they will not cut the rates again any time<br />soon. However, with Trump's volatility in placing<br />tariffs, it is possible that the rates will<br />increase.","Joshua Kang (80%): At the last meeting of the<br />Federal Reserve, the decision was made to leave<br />the interest rates unchanged. A combination of<br />steady inflation and a strong labor market make<br />it unlikely they will change the interest rates<br />in their March meeting. Although there is a strong<br />chance they will in the future, I am confident the<br />interest rates will stay the same in March.","Julia Loggins (92%): The Federal Reserve's<br />Federal Open Market Committee has shown a<br />cautious approach because of concerns surrounding<br />inflation. Statements from Governor Christopher<br />Waller and Raphael Bostic have shown a want to<br />wait before making any adjustments. According to<br />the CME FedWatch Tool, the odds of a Fed rate cut<br />are 22.3%. In addition, on Polymarket there is a<br />96.3% chance of no change. With that in mind, I<br />think there is a 92% chance the Federal Reserve<br />decides to keep interest rates unchanged.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (77%): I believe that the US<br />Federal Reserve will not change interest rates<br />at its March meeting. It seems that inflation<br />is still too high and dropping the interest<br />rate would only worsen this issue. Additionally,<br />unemployment is low, so there isn't much of an<br />immediate need to cut interest rates.","Kyle Smith (70%): The federal reserve governor<br />Adriana Kugler stated that the rate should stay<br />stagnant for a while. Taking this into account i<br />say the probability it will remain unchanged at<br />its current percent of 4.25% to 4.50%. This is<br />not the only piece of information as after Trump's<br />inauguration, many officials shared their desire<br />to keep the rate unchanged as well.","Lawton Smith (95%): Based on current market<br />expectations and recent statements from Federal<br />Reserve officials, there is a high probability<br />that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest<br />rates unchanged at its March 18-19 meeting. Market<br />expectations, as reflected by tools like the<br />CME FedWatch Tool, align with this view. Also,<br />Economists polled by FactSet also predict the Fed<br />will hold steady in March, with many eyeing May<br />or June for the next potential cut, depending on<br />inflation and employment trends.","Levi Thomas (77%): The biggest determining factor<br />for whether or not the rates get changed seems<br />to be inflation. All other factors in the economy<br />are at a favorable enough point that the Fed<br />does not want to change. Until the inflation rate<br />reaches the Fed’s target of 2 percent then rates<br />are unlikely to change, and seeing as they are<br />currently at 3 percent it seems like a stretch<br />to assume rates would drop sufficiently enough in<br />time for the March meeting.","Lillie Puhrmann (80%): The U.S. Federal Reserve<br />is likely to keep interest rates the same at its<br />meeting in March 2025. Market data, such as the<br />CME FedWatch Tool, supports this estimate, which<br />indicates 78%. The recent minutes from the Fed<br />meeting show that officials are being careful<br />about lowering rates as they are looking for<br />more proof of decreasing inflation. Similar to<br />Raphael Bostic, some officials predict a rate<br />reduction later in 2025. However, uncertainties<br />around trade, immigration, and inflation make an<br />immediate cut seem unlikely. Still, an unexpected<br />economic change might change things before the<br />summit.","Mabry Cartwright (79%): I suspect the Fed will<br />raise interest rates, possibly in July, if<br />inflation trends the way we are expecting. I do<br />not see the Fed decreasing the interest rates,<br />as they had hoped, until later in the year or<br />possibly early 2026. I do not see this happening<br />in March due to the lagged effect on inflation<br />from the potential tariffs. Polymarket also<br />predicts that there is a 96% chance the Fed leaves<br />the interest rates unchanged in March.","Margaret Pope (100%): If the Fed were to lower<br />interest rates at their March meeting, it would<br />require them to continue forward with a new plan<br />to handle interest rates, especially considering<br />the unknown impacts of the Trump administration<br />on the economy. Considering their March policy<br />setting meeting is only two months into the Trump<br />presidency, it is unlikely the Fed will declare<br />any sort of interest rate cuts that early on.<br />Also taking into consideration Powell’s reluctance<br />towards any changes in the interest rate, I find<br />it highly likely the Fed will keep interest rates<br />unchanged at its March meeting.","Maston Corn (90%): The U.S. Federal Reserve is<br />expected to keep interest rates unchanged in<br />the 4.25% to 4.5% for the majority of the year.<br />Especially with three consecutive cuts last<br />year they are expected to hold off cutting rates<br />entirely. President Donald Trump keeps calling<br />for the FED to lower rates, however it does not<br />seem like they will comply. In January, the FOMC<br />members were unanimous in their decision to leave<br />the rates unchanged, and it seems like this will<br />continue.","Matthew Newby (80%): I believe there is an<br />extremely high chance that interest rates remain<br />unchanged at the next fed meeting. I mainly<br />believe this because of what the Fed chair said<br />about how they will change the rates based on the<br />information in the CPI report and based on that<br />information it seems unlikely that rates will be<br />changed.","Meera Srinivasan (96%): I think it is extremely<br />unlikely that the Fed will cut interest rates<br />given the current state of employment and the<br />economy. If the Fed does cut rates, it will be<br />after the March meeting. Many news outlets have<br />reported that the Fed is anticipated to keep rates<br />unchanged, at least for the time being.","Mia Pisani (80%): I don't think it is likely the<br />Fed will reduce interest rates due to the tariffs<br />and predicted inflation rates. On February 20th,<br />the Federal Reserve Governor, Adriana Kugler,<br />explained she believes the U.S. central bank<br />should not adjust its short term borrowing costs.<br />She also believes inflation rates have \"some way<br />to go,\" leading me to believe interest rates will<br />not be lowered. However, interest rates are a<br />point of contention, especially concerning the<br />housing market. This leads me to believe there<br />is a slight chance they could be lowered due to<br />public pushback.","Milan Yadav (85%): Powell himself stated that<br />economists \"don't need to be in a hurry\" to adjust<br />policy, with the job market solid and inflation<br />relatively unchanged. Many experts say that the<br />Fed will be doing more \"wait-and-see\" strategies<br />on whether or not they should change rates based<br />off of Trump's policies. This will likely continue<br />past the Mar. meeting of the Fed.","Nathaniel Long (78%): According to CBS news, many<br />economists believe that the Federal Reserve will<br />leave their interest rates unchanged until their<br />May meeting. The Fed has been making a \"flurry\"<br />of interest rate cuts since 2024, and with the new<br />presidency of Donald Trump and the prediction of<br />halting cuts, it is likely the rates will remain<br />unchanged.","Niomi Nurse (90%): March is right around the<br />corner, I feel that it is highly likely that<br />the Federal Reserve will keep the interest rate<br />stabilized, or work to maintain it. At its next<br />meeting on March 19, rates are expected to be held<br />steady. It is projected that interest rates may<br />increase throughout the year, but for the first<br />quarter of the year they should remain stabilized.","Pablo Martinez (75%): at the moment inflation is<br />still high and the job market is stable. We just<br />reached the 3% inflation rate mark. Prior to this<br />year, the feds lowered the interest rates 3 times<br />in late 2024 and decided to pause and see how the<br />economy was reacting. with the introduction of<br />new tariffs and see how that would go. With an<br />interest rate above 3% despite the 2% mark by the<br />fed. Changes to the interest rate at this point<br />would be risky and most likely the rates will<br />remain the same by march. throughout the year<br />however changes might come soon but for now its<br />too soon to tell.","Quintin Gallardo (80%): In regards to what the<br />United States federal reserve will do in their<br />March meeting regarding interest rates I believe<br />that there is a fairly high chance that it’ll<br />remain steady. According to most online sources<br />including Forbes, it is highly predicted that the<br />rates will remain the same because the job market<br />seems robust, and the inflation rate is above<br />the target currently and accelerating slightly.<br />Overall things might change in the coming month<br />so I’m reluctant to put something super close to<br />certain but I am 80% confident that it will remain<br />the same.","Rebecca Mcadam (75%): Many markets are predicting<br />that the Fed is planning on cutting interest<br />rates over the course of the year, but they are<br />in no rush to do that immediately. Predictions<br />are leaning towards no change in interest rates at<br />this month's meeting. Any change is predicted to<br />occur towards the middle of the year.","Riley Batz (75%): As inflation remains steady<br />and predicted to increase, President Donald Trump<br />wants the Fed to lower interest rates. However,<br />when making the decision on Jan. 29, 2025, the<br />Fed went against Trump's wishes and kept interest<br />rates the same. I believe the same will occur<br />in March, and there will be no change in the<br />interest rates. Recent economic data has supported<br />the Federal Open Market Committee holding rates<br />steady, with the jobs market continuing to show<br />momentum. That means there’s little reason for<br />interest rate cuts to support job growth. On<br />Feb 12, Jerome Powell stated, \"“With our policy<br />stance now significantly less restrictive than<br />it had been and the economy remaining strong, we<br />do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy<br />stance\". This gives indication that the Fed will<br />not be making changes in March, though it could be<br />possible.","Sarah Joyce (75%): After looking at several news<br />sources, it seems that the Federal Reserve has<br />indicated that they plan to keep interest rates<br />unchanged for the time being. According to their<br />meeting in January, they decided that they would<br />not cut interest rates until there was “further<br />progress on inflation,” and it appears that they<br />believe for the time being it will remain steady.","Senait Pirani (77%): The Federal Reserve is widely<br />expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its<br />March meeting. Market data and Fed officials’<br />statements indicate cautiousness, prioritizing<br />inflation control. However, unexpected economic<br />shifts could influence their decision. While most<br />anticipate no change, some uncertainty remains<br />depending on upcoming economic indicators.","Teya Hagy (75%): I believe strongly that the US<br />federal reserve will decide to keep interest rates<br />unchanged in the March meeting because its current<br />rate is 4.25% to 4.50%. Jerome Powell believes<br />that this is a really good spot to be at and I do<br />not think that he will change the current rate.","Thomas Smith (77%): By most accounts it seems<br />unlikely that interest rates will be cut or<br />changed by the fed at march’s meeting. One of<br />the more notable sources on the matter , the CME<br />FedWatch Tool, puts the odds of rates being cut at<br />23%. I think personally it’s more likely we see a<br />cut during the summer months","Townsend Turner (74%): A rate cut even with<br />inflation at the moment seems unlikely right<br />now. The last cut was in December so still rather<br />recent and in that meeting the Fed laid out some<br />expectations for 2025 that has most thinking that<br />nothing will happen all that fast. Further, the<br />majority of experts say a May 7th cut is likely<br />and that a March 19 cut is therefore not, despite<br />pressure from Trump.","Tristan Thompson (59%): The Federal Reserve is<br />only expected to change interest rates twice this<br />year, the likelihood of them doing this at one of<br />the first meetings is unlikely. 96.4 percent of<br />Polymarket bettors seem to believe that there will<br />be no change in the interest rates by the federal<br />reserve, so I will take those odds.","Vangeli Tsiaras (70%): About a month ago, the<br />Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell,<br />paused interest rate cuts. Powell said there is<br />no reason or rush to cut the rate as the economy<br />is stable but currently undetermined. It is<br />undetermined in the face of President Trump's<br />calls for tariffs, cutting taxes, ETC. I think the<br />Fed will hold a neutral and cautious position and<br />decide not to change interest rates in March.","Wyatt Dasher (90%): There is a pause on the<br />meeting and they have no incentive to move rates<br />faster. The \"CME FedWatch shows a 97.5% chance<br />of no change\" and bank rate also seems to imply<br />that the pause will still be in place. Yet, other<br />sources say that inflation may be on the fall and<br />with that they may lower the rates.","Wyatt Stevenson (35%): The next Federal Open<br />Market Committee meeting will be on March 18-19.<br />Currently, the unemployment rate and job growth<br />look promising; however, the services sector<br />may have some issues with inflation being above<br />the Fed's 2% target. Part of the uncertainty of<br />lowering interest rates is from trade and the<br />immigration policy taking place. Therefore, it<br />looks doubtful for lower interest rates.","James Martin (90%): I think there is a 10%<br />probability that the US Federal Reserve will<br />decide to keep interest rates unchanged at its<br />March meeting because the FOMC has indicated<br />that the current economic condition and the<br />inflation rate does not need immediate changes<br />in the federal fund rate. There are a few factors<br />to consider including the economic conditions,<br />inflation concerns, future projections, and policy<br />statements. With all considered, I still do not<br />think the interest rates will change before the<br />March meeting.","Ruby Douglas (85%): I predict that the central<br />bank is expected to hold rates steady at its<br />next meeting on March 19th. While Trump’s tariff,<br />immigration and tax policies could potentially<br />complicate the Fed’s rate-cutting plans if they<br />create more inflation, if the economy remains<br />somewhat consistent there doesn’t look to be<br />a cut. The cuts also don’t seem to take much<br />pressure off of consumers. Furthermore, In a<br />statement after the January meeting, the Fed<br />noted that “risks to its full employment and low<br />inflation goals are ‘roughly in balance.’”The<br />statement went on to say that the economic outlook<br />is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive<br />to risks on both sides of its dual mandate. The<br />Fed also justified its position of not making<br />another rate cut at this time by stating, Economic<br />activity has continued to expand at a solid pace<br />(Gross Domestic Product grew at a 3% rate in<br />mid-2024)."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.90000000000000002,0.97999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.93000000000000005,0.81999999999999995,0.69999999999999996,0.84999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.69999999999999996,0.75,0.90000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.93999999999999995,0.80000000000000004,0.80000000000000004,0.84999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.80000000000000004,0.80000000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.92000000000000004,0.84999999999999998,0.80000000000000004,0.75,0.94999999999999996,0.59999999999999998,0.87,0.94999999999999996,0.59999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.77000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.98999999999999999,0.90000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.84999999999999998,0.87,0.69999999999999996,0.65000000000000002,1,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.98999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.93999999999999995,0.65000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.82999999999999996,0.84999999999999998,1,0.69999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,1,0.84999999999999998],"y":[1.0376388231990858,0.95028357536066321,1.0002215163316577,0.98418923916760837,0.96281146439723675,0.95085709742270408,0.97700772988609974,0.97194346438627688,0.95772832981310785,0.96779877813532944,0.96533348483499137,1.0313365798909218,1.0177566747646778,1.0271506996592508,0.95596472388133402,1.0062171531375497,1.0131266572745516,0.97175456983968611,1.0050358598586171,1.0071803506929426,1.0331818030914293,0.99187435857020323,0.99109101500362162,1.0377979464596137,0.9782219580840319,1.0425071200123057,1.0217967443633824,1.0163877757498994,1.0123651432106271,0.99549732555169612,0.96721720369532704,0.96547699391376229,1.0426442318130285,0.98024057887960225,0.96107024129014462,0.95811947043985124,1.0304265660000964,1.0277740499237553,0.98367937121074644,0.98274171797093002,1.0229651826433837,1.0055728556355461,0.97099723871797328,0.95959477422293271,0.95597598741296674,0.98539114107843484,0.99236769659910351,0.96041159764863548,1.0201893196906895,1.0338436853140593,0.99588211211375888,1.0026551363291218,1.012530814949423,1.0489661606261507,1.0443715461762622,0.96677868396509437,1.005999860726297,1.018824938731268,1.0034590328345074,1.0246802684850991,0.99355507337022575,0.96284471405670047,0.98034355065319689],"text":["Aaliyah Diaz (90%): I find it highly likely that<br />Mike Johnson will be Speaker of the House on April<br />28th. He was re-elected this year and was followed<br />by a closely contested vote. There hasn’t been<br />any indication of him being challenged by another<br />candidate so I believe it’s safe to say that the<br />probability of this staying the same is high.","Addisen Kameron (98%): 98% The only ways Johnson<br />wouldn’t be is if he’s removed, resigns, or<br />dies; I don't think any of these will happen.<br />Mike Johnson was recently elected and while it<br />was tight it still went through. Marjorie Taylor<br />Greene embarrassingly failed at removing him last<br />year and I don't think she’s gained any support.<br />He’s backed by Trump and his acceptance speech<br />implies he’s excited to continue his career.<br />Unless he upsets half of the House overnight,<br />greatly displeases Trump, or drops dead, Mike<br />Johnson will be the Speaker of the House on April<br />28th.","Andreas Papandreou (90%): Speaker Johnson has the<br />support of President Donald Trump, and a cushion<br />were a motion to vacate would need the support<br />of 9 Republican members. Additionally, Speakers<br />are not removed often historically, and it would<br />be incredibly wild to see two removed within two<br />years. These factors make it much less likely that<br />Speaker Johnson will be removed in the next two<br />months.","Andy Wyatt (93%): Although there are credible<br />threats to Johnson’s leadership, several factors<br />are absent from the current landscape, unlike the<br />situations of Gingrich, Boehner, and McCarthy. The<br />short-term analysis is much more favorable to his<br />maintaining his post. With the recent passage of<br />the reconciliation bill through the House, he is<br />consolidating the caucus into a working majority<br />and delivering priorities. Therefore, I estimate<br />that Johnson has a 93% chance of remaining Speaker<br />by April 28.","Angela Jacobs (82%): I predict an 82% likelihood<br />that Mike Johnson will remain Speaker of the<br />House through April 28, 2025. Speaker removals<br />are extremely rare, and despite GOP divisions,<br />Johnson retains broad support, including from<br />Donald Trump. His slim majority and internal party<br />tensions pose risks, but immediate removal remains<br />unlikely, especially with Trump’s approval still<br />relatively strong after returning to office. While<br />GOP divides and legislative battles could lower<br />his chances, the timeframe is too short for a<br />major shift, keeping the probability below 90% but<br />above 75%.","Anna Rachwalski (70%): Johnson and Trump currently<br />have a good relationship. However, Johnson's<br />position is precarious, and if he loses the<br />president's mandate, he will lose it quickly.<br />Given the GOP’s narrow majority, any move to<br />oust him would require near-unanimous Republican<br />support or bipartisan cooperation, which is<br />unlikely.","Archita Gaur (85%): The prediction that Mike<br />Johnson has an 85% chance of remaining Speaker<br />until April 28, 2025, is based on his proven<br />ability to secure crucial votes, his close<br />alignment with Donald Trump, and the absence of a<br />clear and unified alternative candidate. However,<br />the remaining 15% acknowledges the inherent<br />instability within the House and the potential<br />for uprisings from the conservative wing of the<br />Republican Party.","Ava Herring (60%): I believe that although there<br />is a chance that Mike Johnson will be the speaker,<br />his chances are somewhat rocky. There is not a<br />clear replacement that Republicans would want<br />to vote for if they do end up deciding that they<br />do not want Johnson. Johnson also aligns with<br />Trump's views on certain issues, which gives him<br />some support. However, if the GOP divisions get<br />worse, Johnson does not have a good chance of<br />being the Speaker. The spending deal is also a<br />very controversial issue that has led many to turn<br />against him.","Ayaan Fazal (65%): Given the recent narrow passage<br />of a Republican budget plan, with a 217-215 vote,<br />highlights a division within the party. Many<br />conservative members advocate for deeper spending<br />cuts, while moderates express their concern over<br />these reductions. With these internal conflicts, I<br />feel it is somewhat probable that Mike Johnson is<br />speaker of the house, but it is not guaranteed.","Bailey Mattox (70%): I honestly didn't have a<br />chance to research this as much as I would have<br />liked. Johnson was just reelected in January<br />although it was by a rather narrow majority.<br />Trump so far has been supportive of Johnson which<br />leads me to believe that fellow Republicans who<br />currently hold a majority will fall in line behind<br />Trump's recommendations.","Bennie Trujillano (75%): While there was some bad<br />blood between Mike Johnson and some Republicans,<br />I don't believe anything will come of it. Trump<br />endorsed Johnson and is working with him and he<br />seems to be playing ball and getting things done.<br />There was the rumor that Elon could be appointed<br />as speaker but I'm doubtful of that. Johnson would<br />have to fail pretty spectacularly to be ousted, if<br />anything happens at this point I'd be surprised.","Brooke Cheney (90%): Though there are certainly<br />deep divisions in the GOP currently and there is<br />history of a motion to vacate the chair in 2023<br />for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, I think Johnson will<br />secure his seat. McCarthy was more pragmatic<br />while Johnson is a staunch conservative, which<br />has bought him more grace from the GOP. Also,<br />McCarthy had history of political rivalries and<br />made enemies on the way, which Johnson did not.<br />I do think it is possible for him to be ousted in<br />2025, but given the current state of chaos with<br />wars, the budget ceiling, and changes with Trump’s<br />presidency, I think this falls low on the list<br />currently.","Chinelo Ireh (80%): On February 25, the<br />House of Representatives narrowly passed the<br />Trump-supported budget bill. In a 217 to 215<br />vote, the GOP was able to get a budget bill with<br />massive tax cuts and government spending cuts.<br />Any serious threat to Mike Johnson’s speakership<br />is now gone because he was able to whip the<br />Republican majority into voting for the budget.<br />All but one Republican supported this measure so I<br />would assume they are likely to also support Mike<br />Johnson’s leadership.","Chloe Cooper (94%): Republicans have the majority<br />of seats in the House and, although Johnson may<br />not be the most popular, it doesn't look like<br />he's going anywhere in the foreseeable future.<br />Johnson and Trump just recently worked together<br />and managed to pass a budget resolution that helps<br />Trump push his agenda, which further supports the<br />idea that the republicans will stick by his side<br />at least for the time being. Johnson was also just<br />recently re-elected as speaker in January so it<br />feels like he won't be out in April, as it seems<br />like a quick turnaround after so recently being<br />re-elected.","Christian Barr (80%): I believe Mike Johnson<br />stays. While his public perception is on an<br />declining rate and has been blamed for politically<br />shamed things such as the government shutdowns, I<br />don't believe there is such a rush to replace Mike<br />Johnson by April 28th as he still aligns with the<br />majority and their values. Mike would want to stay<br />in the good graces of the Republican party, with<br />him making sure he does what Trump wants him to<br />do.","Da In Song (80%): Considering average term<br />length, Party support, family troubles, house<br />majority, Trump's personal support for Mike<br />Johnson, and the party's neck-to-neck majority<br />over the Democrats, I give it a high chance that<br />Mike Johnson will remain Speaker. While he may<br />not have party support and may have a personal<br />interest in spending time with his family, the<br />Republicans would not want to lose one of their<br />representatives as Speaker and Trump will want to<br />keep Mr. Johnson around as his 'quarterback' as<br />Mr. Johnson so advertised for his re-election.","Eli Henderson (85%): While Mike Johnson retained<br />his position as speaker of the house during the<br />roll call in early January, there is some reason<br />to believe he may be ousted before the end of<br />the semester. The reasoning entirely lies on the<br />freedom caucus of the Republican party, which<br />consists of about 30 or so members. They have<br />recently disagreed with Johnson and promised<br />to elect him so long as Johnson fulfills their<br />demands about border security, reversing Biden<br />administration policies, and spending cuts. The<br />spending cuts will be tricky, but other than<br />that there is little in the way of Mike Johnson<br />remaining speaker of the house, especially with<br />his endorsement from Donald Trump, which is<br />especially significant within the Republican<br />party.","Emma Allen (90%): In January 2025, Johson was<br />re-elected as Speaker after flipping two GOP<br />opponents, following an intervention by President<br />Trump. Historically speaking, it is extremely<br />rare that the Speaker of the House be removed. The<br />most notable recent removal was Kevin McCarthy in<br />October 2023 but that was the first time a Speaker<br />was ever removed through the “motion to vacate”<br />process. Additionally, I do not foresee grounds<br />on which House members choose to go against any<br />member of the Republican party with Trump in<br />office now.","Emma Pastor (80%): Historically, only one Speaker<br />of the House has been successfully removed from<br />their position by the House, and that was in<br />October of 2023 when Kevin McCarthy was voted<br />out. Although this was somewhat recent in terms<br />of occurrence, I still believe that the likelihood<br />of Johnson being removed is quite low, therefore<br />he will remain as Speaker of the House until April<br />28 in that case. Further, although Johnson only<br />secured this spot very narrowly in terms of votes,<br />I don't foresee him stepping down himself, another<br />infrequent occurrence, with only 3 speakers<br />historically resigning from the position, and 4<br />resigning from the House while in office.","Emma Peterson (80%): I chose 80% for this<br />question because Mike Johnson was just reelected<br />as speaker of the house back in the beginning of<br />January. While it was a narrow vote, he still got<br />majority vote nonetheless. It is also very rare<br />for a speaker of the house to be removed from the<br />position and it has not been discussed that this<br />is a possibility for Johnson. In knowing this, I<br />strongly believe he will still be speaker of the<br />house by the end of April.","Ethan Marcum (80%): He has already received the<br />votes, and seems to be working along side Trump<br />in different topics. I feel that come April 28th<br />he will still be the Speaker of the House. I feel<br />that he has a large backing at this moment and has<br />already proven to swing certain votes.","Grace Mccann (90%): He was just reelected to the<br />Position on January 3rd 2025. There are no signs<br />of major unrest or challenges to his leadership.<br />The only major problem he is currently facing is<br />an extremely narrow house majority, one of the<br />most narrow majorities in history.","Grace Reichelderfer (92%): In 2 months, I find it<br />highly unlikely that Speaker Johnson be removed<br />from office. One of the main factors that led<br />to my prediction is the fact that Trump is now<br />President and in control of the Republican party.<br />It seems unlikely that any member of the House<br />of Representatives would defy Trump by starting a<br />campaign to remove Johnson from the Speakership.<br />Additionally, I do not think Trump would take the<br />time away from pushing his agenda in the first<br />100 days to start the campaign himself. Johnson<br />was also just reelected as Speaker in January.<br />Although it was by a narrow margin, Johnson was<br />still able to get the votes to remain Speaker.<br />I believe there is a 92% probability that Mike<br />Johnson will be Speaker of the House on April<br />28th.","Hannah Carson (85%): I believe there is an 85%<br />chance that Mike Johnson is Speaker of the House<br />by April 28. I feel like there is no other strong<br />contenders for speaker. Additionally, he was<br />already minority leader so I feel like there is<br />a good chance he goes into being the majority<br />leader. Also, President Trump supports him which I<br />feel like will help his election. Although, there<br />has been some contention about his tax cuts and<br />spending changes, I believe these won't affect his<br />case enough for him not to be speaker.","Isabella Molina (80%): I do believe Mike Johnson<br />will still be the speaker of the house. I do<br />think what could change this is trump creating<br />tension within the house but it is stated that<br />Trump like the speaker of the house currently. But<br />Mike Johnson could lose his position as Speaker<br />if internal GOP divisions arise, especially over<br />major policy issues or disagreements with Trump's<br />agenda. But since there is no big talks of his<br />removal or him withdrawing I think it's safe to<br />say he will remain in his position.","Jacob Weiss (75%): Mike Johnson had Trump's<br />support to win speaker of the house. Since then<br />he has been supporting the trump agenda even<br />weird ideas such as the Trump Gaza plan. As long<br />as Trump supports him I see little reason why he<br />would lose support. Trump is a political anomaly<br />and there is always the opportunity he could<br />change his mind.","Jenny Qiu (95%): For the speaker of the house to<br />be removed, there has to be a motion to vacate.<br />The only speaker of the house to be removed<br />through such method was Kevin McCarthy, who was<br />in office from Jan 2023 to Oct 2023. Not only is<br />a motion to vacate unlikely, it's also difficult<br />for the vote to pass. Last year, a representative<br />did file a motion to vacate but it was \"killed\"<br />quickly by the House.","Jerusalem Greenberg (60%): Mike Johnson's win as<br />the speaker of the house came with a new house<br />rule that it now requires nine GOP lawmakers to<br />introduce a removal in order to force a vote,<br />rather than one. This obvious desperate grab for<br />power is a normal thing to expect from the Trump<br />regime and his exhausting control over everything,<br />but one thing is clear: it will be incredibly<br />difficult to get Mike Johnson out of his chair now<br />that this rule is in place.","Jessy Lee (87%): Many republicans have found<br />skepticism in Mike Johnson, but I do not think he<br />will be removed before April 28. In May of 2024,<br />Marjorie Taylor Greene failed to remove Johnson<br />from his position, not only did the republicans<br />support him, but the democrats joined them in<br />supporting him. Many supported him in efforts<br />from plunging the country in to further chaos.<br />The success of motion for the speaker of the<br />house has only ever happened once, last year and<br />is found pretty rare. While many are unsure of<br />Johnson's new budget plan and many don't favor<br />him, I believe to save the country from trouble<br />and chaos, he will not be removed.","Joey Khashan (95%): Considering that Mike Johnson<br />only has to make it through 2 more months, I find<br />it highly unlikely that he will be removed from<br />his position as Speaker of the House by April<br />28th. Kevin McCarthy was very unpopular with the<br />extreme right, who removed him after only 269<br />days. This was the shortest time served in over<br />a century. I find it very hard to believe that<br />a man who was endorsed by Trump will have one of<br />the shortest terms in Speaker history at only 185<br />days.","Joshua Kang (60%): In the past, Johnson has had<br />issues with nearly getting ousted from the House<br />Speaker position. Currently, it seems that Mike<br />Johnson will ultimately toe the party line,<br />keeping his interests aligned with President<br />Trump. This would keep him in good graces with<br />most of the majority Republican representatives,<br />who are seemingly mainly rallying behind Trump. He<br />has shown some willingness to negotiate with the<br />Democrats, who may see him as a better alternative<br />than an even more hardline GOP Speaker. However,<br />there is still conflict behind his Speakership,<br />leading to the uncertain 60%, biased towards him<br />keeping his position.","Julia Loggins (70%): In order for Mike Johnson<br />to not be Speaker of the House, a few scenarios<br />such as nine member's of his party must vote<br />him out, Johnson could be involved in a scandal,<br />electoral consequences and more. Johnson recently<br />was re-elected on January 3 with Republicans<br />consistently rallying behind him. In addition,<br />Republicans have incentives to remain unified<br />and a change in budget negotiations which could<br />possibly get him removed happen later in the<br />year. There is still some uncertainty but I am 70%<br />confident he will remain.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (77%): I believe that Mike<br />Johnson will still be Speaker of the House by<br />April 28th. Firstly, I don't believe that there is<br />currently a clear pick for who would succeed him<br />and the Republican Party likely does not want to<br />risk a big leadership dilemma. Additionally, it is<br />far from common to remove a speaker mid-term, with<br />McCarthy being an outlier and I don't foresee this<br />happening again in such little time.","Kelsey Dyar (60%): I believe it is likely that<br />Mike Johnson will still be speaker on April<br />28th. While he has faced a lot of pressure<br />from democrats like Hakeem Jeffries, and some<br />republicans, he was just reelected as speaker on<br />January 4th and got his budget plan passed in the<br />house. Johnson has had the support of Trump as he<br />was pushing house republicans to pass the budget.<br />I do not think his job is safe by any means but<br />I do not believe he will be ousted before April<br />28th.","Kyle Smith (70%): Mike Johnson would join a<br />very small list of just two people that have not<br />lasted 16 months. This brings my estimation down<br />a great amount as a statistical rarity already<br />conventionally provides reasoning on why there<br />should be a low percent given. Although a speaker<br />was recently outed, it was the first time in<br />history that something like that has happened. I<br />find it very improbable that it will happen again<br />only two years after the first occurrence.","Lawton Smith (99%): Mike Johnson has an 99% chance<br />of remaining Speaker of the House on April 28,<br />2025, due to his strong party support, Trump’s<br />backing, and his ability to navigate bipartisan<br />challenges. While some hardliners might oppose his<br />willingness to work across the aisle, the lack of<br />a viable GOP challenger and historical precedent<br />make his removal unlikely. The motion-to-vacate<br />process is rare and difficult, requiring a united<br />opposition that doesn’t currently exist. Barring<br />an extraordinary event, Johnson’s political<br />strategy and the GOP’s slim majority should keep<br />him in power.","Levi Thomas (90%): Johnson has both support from<br />Trump and the benefit of a new rule change that<br />requires nine Republicans to demand a vote of<br />removal before one can be called. This provides<br />him significantly more protection against removal<br />than his predecessor, and it signals that he is<br />very likely to maintain his position at least<br />until the given deadline. Johnson also claims to<br />have cut no deals with House Republicans to gain<br />the Speakership, which means he has less pressure<br />to cave to their immediate demands.","Lillie Puhrmann (60%): It seems that Mike Johnson<br />has a pretty good chance, around 60%, of becoming<br />House Speaker on April 28, 2025. Even though<br />he won re-election in January, the Republican<br />Party has a fragile majority and faces internal<br />divisions, which makes his situation uncertain.<br />His connection to Donald Trump helps him gain<br />support from pro-Trump Republicans, but moderates<br />and opponents might criticize him. Because of<br />issues with House leadership and the shifting<br />political environment, his position as speaker<br />might be at risk. But with his support, it seems<br />pretty unlikely that he’ll be removed anytime<br />soon.","Mabry Cartwright (90%): I placed the probability<br />that Mike Johnson will be Speaker of the House<br />at 90%. This is relatively high, but I do not<br />see any indication that he would be removed or<br />resign from this role in the next two months.<br />He recently came into this role and seems to be<br />working to implement Trump's agenda. I also think<br />it is unlikely that he will be removed because the<br />only time this has happened was recently with the<br />former Speaker, Kevin McCarthy.","Margaret Pope (85%): Although Mike Johnson only<br />slightly won Speaker of House in January by 3<br />votes, I find it likely he will still be speaker<br />on April 28. The polarization of Congress is<br />extremely high right now, and if Johnson continues<br />to divide Congress, there is a chance he will<br />unable to hold out as speaker. As of right now,<br />there are no attempts to replace Johnson, and<br />considering Republicans hold the majority, they<br />may not attempt to remove him without a surefire<br />candidate.","Maston Corn (70%): Mike Johnson was just reelected<br />to another term to the Speaker of the House in<br />January and the fastest person to be removed from<br />office after being elected in recent history was<br />Kevin McCarthy who had a total tenure of 269 days<br />and was removed in October. Although Mike Johnson<br />is further into his time as Speaker as this is his<br />second term it is unlikely that he will be removed<br />before April. Furthermore, Marjorie Taylor Greene<br />filed a motion to vacate on March 22nd, 2024, and<br />the House voted to kill the motion with a vote of<br />359-43. This was seen as a warning from the more<br />conservative members in the House due to him not<br />aligning with President Trump consistently. It is<br />worrisome that Speaker Johnson has had issues with<br />the budget and unifying the Republican Party and<br />the fact that if they wanted to remove him from<br />office they could do so quite quickly. Rand Paul<br />also announced that Mike Johnson could be removed<br />from office before Spring. However, I do not see<br />this occurring before April 28th.","Meera Srinivasan (85%): Much remains to be<br />seen regarding whether or not Mike Johnson will<br />hold his position as Speaker of the US House of<br />Representatives. Given the slim majority held by<br />the GOP in the chamber, it seems that it will take<br />fewer members defecting from a bill to prevent it<br />from passing, increasing chances for legislative<br />gridlock. Trouble within the House means trouble<br />for Speaker Johnson, and given the narrow margin,<br />even a little trouble could lead to a vote on<br />his position as Speaker. House Republicans were<br />narrowly able to pass a Trump-backed budget<br />resolution, which seems to suggest fair weather<br />ahead. Still, the looming deadline to prevent a<br />government shutdown may lead to rough seas ahead<br />for Speaker Johnson, should he fail to strike a<br />deal satisfactory for the majority caucus. Given<br />the GOP trifecta across the presidency and both<br />chambers of Congress, however, I find it unlikely<br />that Speaker Johnson will be ousted by April.<br />Still, it only takes a few members of his party<br />to trigger a vote on his position—in my view, his<br />fate as leader of his caucus is highly dependent<br />on whether or not the coalitions within the House<br />GOP are able to hold, especially following the<br />March 14 government funding deadline.","Mia Pisani (87%): Speaker of the House Mike<br />Johnson narrowly won his position in January 2025,<br />defeating Hakeem Jeffries 218-215. The Speaker of<br />the House has only been removed once in history,<br />which led to Johnson initially taking on the role.<br />However, four people have resigned as Speaker<br />of the House. I find it unlikely Johnson will<br />resign, especially due to his emphasis of his<br />close relationship with President Trump. House<br />Republicans have voiced their distrust of Johnson,<br />especially during his re-election in January.<br />Many complaints surrounded his willingness to<br />collaborate with Democrats. In order to remove<br />Johnson, only one member would need to bring a<br />\"motion to vacate,\" in order to force a vote. If<br />a member were to bring this motion, Johnson would<br />likely be removed, as only 4 Republicans would<br />need to abstain or vote against him. However, I do<br />not see a motion being brought after only 3 months<br />after Johnson's election.","Milan Yadav (70%): Johnson just narrowly got<br />re-elected with a 218-215 vote recently. Ever<br />since McCarthy's removal a couple of years ago,<br />most Republicans are hesitant to remove yet<br />another Speaker since it only causes confusion and<br />disarray. He has also maintained strong alliances<br />with opposition minus far-right members. No real<br />challenger to take Johnson's place exists as well.<br />Also, Trump backs Johnson so that holds a great<br />deal of weight","Nathaniel Long (65%): Most sources I found<br />discussing Mike Johnson losing his speakership<br />were either from 2024 or the first few days of<br />2025. While there have been efforts to oust him<br />from his position (ex: Marjorie Taylor Greene),<br />none seem to be recent, especially with Donald<br />Trump's support of Johnson. To me it seems<br />unlikely that, after 2 months of Johnson's second<br />term, that he will be relieved of speakership, at<br />least before April 28th.","Niomi Nurse (100%): Mike Johnson has been<br />re-elected to become speaker of the house for this<br />2025 Trump Presidential term. He is a Republican<br />and won the vote from speaker of the house in a<br />dramatic floor election from the senate who were<br />very divided. Trump has established unified GOP<br />control by Republicans, leaving Democrats without<br />much leverage.","Pablo Martinez (75%): Given the Republican Party’s<br />slim majority in the House and ongoing internal<br />divisions, Johnson’s position remains delicate.<br />While he currently holds the speakership, the<br />political landscape is dynamic, and leadership<br />roles can be subject to change As of February<br />26, 2025, Mike Johnson serves as the Speaker of<br />the U.S. House of Representatives, having been<br />re-elected on January 3, 2025, with a narrow<br />218–215 majority. His re-election was secured<br />after initial opposition from some Republican<br />members was overcome, partly due to intervention<br />by President Donald Trump.","Quintin Gallardo (85%): With Mike Johnson, only<br />recently winning reelection as the speaker of the<br />house in January, I find it unlikely that he will<br />be removed so quickly. Despite the bitter marginal<br />support that favored him I find it unlikely that<br />between now and April 28 the Republicans will<br />find a reason strong enough to replace it. As it<br />stands currently enough, Republicans still support<br />Mike Johnson. For something to change enough that<br />Republicans flip might not take a lot, but they<br />most likely wouldn’t vote that way as having a<br />Republican speaker is most important to them.","Rebecca Mcadam (99%): As a result of his approval<br />ratings and the overall unlikely chance that<br />Johnson will be removed from his position, I think<br />it is nearly guaranteed that he will be Speaker<br />of the House on April 28th. Only one other Speaker<br />has been removed from the position, which was in<br />2023.","Riley Batz (85%): Mike Johnson was re-elected<br />speaker of the house on January 3rd, though it was<br />a bit of an uphill battle for him. However, since<br />his re-election, he has made it clear that it is<br />his objective to gather the votes needed to pass<br />President Trump's agenda. After his re-election,<br />Speaker Mike Johnson said said he was \"100%\"<br />confident that he will remain speaker throughout<br />the entire 119th Congress. Though I am not basing<br />my entire prediction off of Speaker Mike Johnson's<br />prediction, I see no indication that he will not<br />be speaker by the end of the semester. There has<br />been no public discussion of removing him, and<br />unless there is an extremely surprising event<br />within the next 2 months, I believe he will still<br />be speaker.","Sarah Joyce (90%): I think it is highly unlikely<br />that Mike Johnson will not be Speaker of the<br />House. He has just been reelected, and the Speaker<br />position lasts for 2 years. The only way he might<br />not be Speaker is if he resigned or was removed,<br />and it seems highly unlikely that he would resign<br />and even more unlikely that he would be voted out<br />of office. Kevin McCarthy was previously voted out<br />of office, but he was the only Speaker in history<br />to have been.","Senait Pirani (95%): Mike Johnson is still Speaker<br />of the House, and there’s no clear sign that will<br />change by April 28, 2025. While there’s always<br />political drama, he’s managed to hold on so far.<br />Unless something major happens, he’ll likely<br />stay in charge and keep leading House Republicans<br />through the session.","Sreya Pandyaram (94%): Mike Johnson will most<br />likely remain as the Speaker of the House because<br />he was elected very recently and usually an<br />election happens every two years-the beginning<br />of a new congress. However, there have been a<br />few cases where speakers of the house did resign<br />due to internal political pressure such as John<br />Boehner. And with Johnson there re many moderate<br />conservatives who of not approve of his election<br />as a speaker due to his association with more<br />conservative republicans, and also simply his<br />perceived lack of experience. His only saving<br />grace is probably President Trump, and since Trump<br />was able to make the vote of through in the first<br />place, there is high possibility that Johnson will<br />stay until April 28th. Also it was reported today<br />morning that a Trump-backed spending bill had<br />passed though.","Teya Hagy (65%): I think that there is a high<br />probability that Mike Johnson will be speaker of<br />the house. I believe that he will because Trump<br />has a big influence on how the public views people<br />and I believe that Republicans will back him up,<br />making him speaker of the house.","Thomas Smith (80%): Mike Johnson so far has been<br />one of the Republican party's most affective<br />messengers. He is often to take democratic<br />victories and make them appear as failures and<br />he is very good at making sure no one forgets<br />democratic failures. It also helps that Johnson is<br />very loyal to Trump and shows absolutely no signs<br />of disloyalty to the president. The Republicans<br />just passed their budget in the house as well<br />which is a big win for Johnson.","Tiyanah Rowtham (83%): In my opinion, there is<br />an 83% chance that Mike Johnson will continue<br />to be the speaker of the House on April 28. He<br />was voted in early January and “the House made<br />it harder to remove a speaker by approving a<br />key procedural change that requires a minimum of<br />nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote on an ouster.<br />Previously, it only required one member to force a<br />vote.” This will make it harder to vote him out of<br />office. He is also working to push Trumps agenda<br />forward.","Townsend Turner (85%): Mike Johnson is the best<br />thing Trump has ever had to a competent leader<br />that will do what he says to the letter. The proof<br />is in that budget bill in December. Trump will<br />protect Johnson’s speakership and I doubt that<br />he will do anything controversial to make that<br />hard. Finally, with Gaetz in hot water, Johnson’s<br />biggest ousting threat is lessened as well.","Tristan Thompson (100%): With the Speaker of the<br />House vote wrapping up early last January, with<br />Mike Johnson being established as the Speaker of<br />the House, I believe that he will most definitely<br />be the Speaker of the House on the 28th of April.<br />The only way he could be removed from office is<br />from a Motion to Vacate which is extremely rare<br />and unlikely.","Vangeli Tsiaras (70%): Mike Johnson will likely<br />still be the speaker on April 28th. His close<br />relationship with Donald Trump, recent successful<br />reelection as speaker, and success in passing<br />both the Laken Riley Act and the Budget plan<br />in Congress show he can be a good and efficient<br />leader for the Republican party.","Wyatt Dasher (95%): He is already speaker of<br />the house. With that being said he would have to<br />either step down or get voted out by April. It<br />is already pretty much march and with that they<br />would have 2 months to change the speaker. He just<br />started his term January 3rd. So it just seems<br />like to quick of a turn around.","Wyatt Stevenson (95%): It is very likely that<br />Mike Johnson will still be speaker of the house<br />by April 28th. Before Trump was inaugurated into<br />office, he had endorsed speaker Mike Johnson.<br />Trump has recognized speaker Mike Johnson as<br />a hard working and religious man. Mike Johnson<br />has also recently swayed some voters to pass a<br />budget proposal that favors his work and efforts<br />as speaker. If he continues to work hard and help<br />Trump with legislation, he will continue to be<br />speaker.","James Martin (100%): I think there is a 100%<br />probability that Mike Johnson will be Speaker<br />of the House on April 28. He was re-elected to<br />a full term speaker in January 2025. Since his<br />re-election there has been no indications of any<br />changes to his position since then. He has the<br />backing of members of his party including Donald<br />Trump.","Ruby Douglas (85%): I think Mike Johnson will<br />still be Speaker of the House on April 28 because<br />even though his return as speaker was somewhat<br />in the air, he has Trump's endorsement.

First,<br />although he is 76 years old, remarkably, that<br />would be on the younger side of justices who have<br />announced retirement in recent decades: Stevens<br />- 90, Blackmun - 86, Breyer - 83, Marshall - 83,<br />Kennedy - 81, Powell - 80, Burger - 78, O'Connor<br />- 76, Souter - 70. (Souter is the outlier there;<br />reporting suggests that he was keen to retire as<br />soon as Obama was elected in 2008. By comparison,<br />Clarence Thomas seems to enjoy being a Supreme<br />Court justice.) Second, it would mean he announces<br />in the middle of the Supreme Court's term; mostly<br />justices announce their retirement when the term<br />ends in mid-summer. Third, there's no particular<br />urgency for him to retire *this* year even if he<br />was being pragmatic. Senate elections aren't until<br />2026; he could easily serve another year.","Joe Ornstein (55%): The most Outside View of<br />all says 50%. There are, per tradition, 46<br />Americans and 46 non-Americans in the tournament,<br />and Americans have won 18 out of the past 30<br />tournaments. Surprisingly, the Inside View doesn't<br />diverge much from that. Adding up the implied<br />probabilities from betting odds for each of the<br />American golfers gives us roughly 55%. Scottie<br />Scheffler is the favorite by far, but with so many<br />golfers in the field the Vegas odds give him only<br />a 22% chance of winning, while the second favorite<br />(Rory McIlroy) has something like a 12% chance.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Even the most ambitious<br />timeline for the \"one bill\" reconciliation<br />strategy ends with Senate passage in late May, and<br />there's ample reason to believe that timeline will<br />slip a bit. This week, Congress will be consumed<br />by avoiding a government shutdown on March 14.<br />House committees are working to submit legislation<br />consistent with the Feb 25 resolution by March<br />27, after which the House Budget Committee will<br />staple it all together and put it to the floor<br />in early April, with the goal of securing House<br />passage before the Easter recess. *Assuming* all<br />that works out, the Senate wouldn't even start<br />considering it until they reconvene on April<br />28.

The last<br />shutdown was in 2018. Although we may be overdue<br />for a shutdown, the lack of shutdowns since<br />Trump's first term also represents an emerging<br />reticence in Congress to allow spending to lapse.<br />House Republicans appear to be falling in line<br />for the new CR, which means it will come down to<br />Senate Democrats. Seven Democrats must support<br />all Republicans to overcome a filibuster. It’s<br />interesting that Senate Democrats haven’t ruled<br />out supporting avoiding a shutdown. Passage of the<br />CR is more likely than not, but it’s not certain.","Bailey Mattox (3%): Congress is meeting today to<br />make sure the government doesn’t get shut down and<br />I think it is not in Trump’s best interest for it<br />to go into a shut down and bring attention to it.<br />If republicans can’t come together for a budget<br />bill, it makes it look like Trump can’t get his<br />congress in line.","Benjamin Jacobstein (35%): While the mainstream<br />media is showing overwhelming Democratic<br />opposition to the proposed funding bill due to<br />concerns over cuts to social welfare programs,<br />*this is a gut feeling* but I don't believe that<br />the Democratic Party would want to look like<br />they are the ones responsible for a shutdown, the<br />party is already struggling to rebuild credibility<br />after their 2024 losses, and I don't think they'll<br />want to dig themselves into a deeper hole. If the<br />bill included provisions for extending the 2017<br />tax cuts, then maybe their response might end up<br />being more in opposition; however, there have been<br />no official indications of such measures in the<br />current proposal, and I think they will flip for<br />the sake of unity.","Bennie Trujillano (40%): While there is only a<br />slim majority, the GOP has been managing to get<br />votes from across the aisle consistently. The<br />democratic party has also expressed some support<br />for a short term stopgap measure. Considering how<br />the current democratic party has been handling<br />Trump's presidency I just don't see any kind of<br />fight being put up, at least not in the house.","Emma Allen (28%): To fund the government and<br />avert a shutdown, both the House and Senate need<br />to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing<br />resolution, extending funding. Then this would go<br />to President Trump to sign. Currently, Republicans<br />have a razor thin majority in the House and are<br />in need of 8 democratic senators to support the<br />bill. I think Congress will act to avoid a “shut<br />down” because of the disruption it poses and how<br />rare shutdowns historically have been. I think<br />some Democrats will not want to risk being blamed<br />for the shutdown, and prefer to wait for the fight<br />over the regular budget, where arguably they have<br />the stronger hand by opposing cuts to Medicaid,<br />Medicare, and Social Security.","Ethan Joyce (23%): Low Appetite for a Shutdown<br />– Both parties seem inclined to avoid it,<br />and historical precedent shows that shutdowns<br />typically arise from severe partisan standoffs.<br />Alternative Measures – Congress has the ability<br />to pass a short-term continuing resolution (CR),<br />and this seems to be the most probable outcome.<br />Unified Government – Historically, shutdowns<br />haven’t happened when one party controls the White<br />House, House, and Senate. Polymarket Odds at 33%<br />– This suggests some uncertainty, possibly due to<br />last-minute political maneuvering or unforeseen<br />disagreements.","Hannah Carson (30%): I would say no the federal<br />government is not going to shut down on March<br />15th. First of all, the Democratic Party doesn't<br />have the majority in Congress right now and I<br />think it would be difficult for them to cause a<br />shutdown. Additionally, a lot of the times when<br />a situation like this where they government could<br />shut down, they come to a last minute deal to<br />avoid government shutdown and I feel like this<br />is what is going to happen in this situation. A<br />shutdown will cause public backlash and market<br />consequences and it is in the government's best<br />interest to try to avoid the shutdown.","Margaret Pope (47%): I find it unlikely the<br />government shuts down on Friday due to the rare<br />occurrences that the government has shut down in<br />the part. Currently, if the partisan bill passes<br />the House, it will have to receive votes from 8<br />Democratic senators, which seems unlikely. If the<br />bill is changed to a short term plan, I think it<br />will be passed. I am honestly unsure due to the<br />demands of democrats and the reluctance of speaker<br />Mike Johnson to create a bipartisan bill.","Maston Corn (41%): The GOP has drafted a<br />Continuing Resolution to extend the temporary<br />funding measures until they can reach a conclusion<br />on the budget. Speaker Mike Johnson said they<br />would vote on the resolution this week and it<br />is likely that the GOP will unify together to<br />extend the timeline and avoid a shutdown. Some<br />Democratic lawmakers may vote with the Republicans<br />to avoid a shutdown as many of them deem it<br />would be irresponsible to not extend the funding.<br />However, time is running out and by March 15th<br />the government will shut down if the Continuing<br />Resolution is not passed.","Milan Yadav (15%): This was close to happening<br />in last Congress as well but a continuing<br />resolution (CR) was passed by both houses and thus<br />allowed for adequate funding to happen. CR's are<br />oftentimes used as more of a last-minute drastic<br />solution that isn't as good as a standard funding<br />bill but still gets the job done. At the end of<br />the day, a shutdown is unfortunate for all sides<br />and the citizens, but some members may think this<br />Trump-backed CR is a","Nathaniel Long (65%): Currently, Congress is<br />planning a 'stopgap' measure to prevent the<br />impending government shutdown, which requires<br />at least 60 votes in the Senate to be passed<br />(among House support as well). The reason for the<br />Senate's role being so important is because the<br />Republican party only has a 53-seat majority in<br />the Senate, and the Democrats needed for support<br />are currently dissenting of the stopgap measure's<br />plan for funding and its potential delivery of<br />more power to the Republican party.","Rebecca Mcadam (60%): I think there is a<br />reasonable chance that the spending bill will pass<br />in the Senate but not the House. This is because<br />Senate Democrats seem to be on board with anything<br />that will avoid a government shutdown, while<br />House Democrats are strongly against the bill.<br />This could be related to Trump's endorsement of<br />the bill or the idea that it will cut funding for<br />social welfare programs.","Ruby Douglas (65%): House Republicans have put<br />forward a six-month funding bill that would keep<br />the government running through September 30,<br />2025. They want to cut overall spending by $7<br />billion compared to 2024 - slashing $13 billion<br />from non-defense programs while boosting defense<br />spending by $6 billion. Democrats aren't having it<br />though. They say these cuts would hurt important<br />programs like healthcare and veterans' services.<br />House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is telling<br />his party to vote against it. With Democrats<br />opposing the bill and even some Republicans on<br />the fence, it's looking pretty iffy whether any<br />funding will pass by the March 14 deadline. If<br />nothing gets approved by then, we're looking at a<br />government shutdown starting March 15. Given how<br />far apart everyone seems right now, a shutdown is<br />probably more likely than not.","Senait Pirani (85%): Republicans introduced a<br />continuing resolution over the weekend that they<br />will need Democrat support to pass. At least one<br />Republican has pledged to oppose the resolution,<br />and the GOP will need at least 5 Democrats to<br />vote in their favor. I simply don't think this<br />will happen given interparty relations and Trump's<br />support for the resolution.","Thomas Smith (33%): I think Trump and<br />congressional republican leaders will be doing<br />everything in their power from preventing this<br />from happening. A government shutdown this soon<br />into a president's term is unprecedented. Trump<br />himself seems to not know the outcome saying \"you<br />never know\" which leaves some room for doubt that<br />a resolution will be agree upon.","Vangeli Tsiaras (20%): Most likely, the federal<br />government will not shut down on March 15th. While<br />there is a strong possibility that the government<br />will shut down during Trump's presidency and<br />possibly in 2025, it will not be on or before<br />March 15th. With Trump having Republican and<br />Conservative majorities in the Senate, the<br />House of Representatives, and the Supreme Court<br />primarily siding with him, I think that the<br />vast majority of Trump's policy plans will be<br />successful in his first two years. Even far-right<br />politicians like Thomas Massie, who has voiced<br />opposition to the funding bill, will likely<br />fall into line from pressure by Trump and other<br />Republicans."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.14999999999999999,0.80000000000000004,0.02,0.84999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.65000000000000002,0.81999999999999995,0.029999999999999999,0.68999999999999995,0.14999999999999999,0.32000000000000001,0.81000000000000005,0.14999999999999999,0.65000000000000002,0.34999999999999998,0.080000000000000002,0.68000000000000005,0.27000000000000002,0.10000000000000001,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.01,0.69999999999999996,0.25,0.02,0.84999999999999998,0.72999999999999998,0.26000000000000001,0.62,0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.080000000000000002,0.78000000000000003,0.14999999999999999,0.71999999999999997,0.20000000000000001,0.01,0.68000000000000005,0.29999999999999999,0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.050000000000000003,0.80000000000000004,0.38,0.39000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.52000000000000002,0.22,0.41999999999999998,0.10000000000000001,0.75,0.40000000000000002,0.050000000000000003,0.65000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.02,0.68000000000000005,0.45000000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.78000000000000003,0.40000000000000002,0.33000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.28000000000000003,0.14999999999999999,0.65000000000000002,1,0.10000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.070000000000000007,0.62,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.34999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.42999999999999999,0.67000000000000004,0.14999999999999999,0.76000000000000001,0.25,0.40000000000000002,0.10000000000000001,0.34999999999999998,0.029999999999999999,0.67000000000000004,0.070000000000000007,0.22,0.82999999999999996,0.29999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.59999999999999998,0.10000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.10000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.050000000000000003,0.59999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.10000000000000001,0.51000000000000001,0.33000000000000002,0.23999999999999999,0.60999999999999999,0.28000000000000003,0.050000000000000003,0.34999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.029999999999999999,0.55000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.12,0.71999999999999997,0.14000000000000001,0.070000000000000007,0.65000000000000002,0.080000000000000002,0.34000000000000002,0.72999999999999998,0.80000000000000004,0.10000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.75,0.75,0.20000000000000001,0.68000000000000005,0.38,0.65000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.070000000000000007,0.050000000000000003,0.53000000000000003,0.40000000000000002,0.10000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.28999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.85999999999999999,0.29999999999999999,0.68000000000000005,0.10000000000000001,0.82999999999999996,0.62,0.029999999999999999,0.55000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.17000000000000001,0.55000000000000004,0.12,0.35999999999999999,0.56999999999999995,0.41999999999999998,0.01,0.90000000000000002,0,0.69999999999999996,0.59999999999999998,0.10000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.55000000000000004,0.29999999999999999,0.59999999999999998,0.050000000000000003,0.69999999999999996,0.75],"y":[2.0005626818630846,0.96603927817195656,2.0236653126310555,0.97230308905709539,3.952290974301286,2.0083656699396668,0.95012542344629769,3.9753958203364164,1.9621603161329404,1.0245165849337354,3.9718440170632676,2.0391397789586336,0.99289243970997632,3.9748464488191528,1.0102922082878649,4.0240635378984733,1.989742732862942,0.95104125428479169,3.9799908235203474,2.013108529569581,1.0164290766231716,3.9997881999937817,1.999800771754235,1.0147816329961643,4.0344531811773781,2.0292436548043042,0.96503293092828246,4.0243067585164685,2.0377849083393813,0.95441814919468015,4.0379395455820486,2.0360082636820152,1.0007254198892042,4.0106844601221381,1.9799414213979616,0.99195522558875382,2.0403140716720372,0.97313727098517122,3.9807203107513489,1.9782662185607478,0.97221062274184078,1.9888000323437154,1.0045750724850222,3.9622100663371382,1.9718616340542212,2.0450618834234775,1.011247207550332,0.95138324315194045,4.0054791866336021,1.9825502952560783,0.98757282712031158,4.0416296566370873,1.9735093645052983,3.9508054584730417,1.9647201926913112,1.0114395624259487,3.9667420671554283,2.0366309062344952,1.0151222016429529,4.0122175777563829,2.0096925223479047,1.0039140332490206,3.9574798891553655,4.0209821201628078,2.014628170314245,1.0130829978035762,3.9933236490003763,1.9850734215229751,0.985141881508752

Diaz (15%): I find it highly unlikely that<br />Clarence Thomas will announce his retirement from<br />the Supreme Court before April 28. For one, it’s<br />difficult to tell as these types of activities<br />are kept private within the Supreme Court. Another<br />reason why I believe he won’t retire is because I<br />believe he will try to do the same thing as Ruth<br />Bader Ginsburg and stay on until he is forced to<br />leave or passes.","Aaliyah Diaz (80%): I find it highly likely that<br />an American will win the Masters Tournament.<br />American’s have typically won them in the past,<br />so I find the chances of it occurring again<br />pretty high just because of it. According to<br />recent updates many talented American golfers are<br />set to play in the game, making the odds pretty<br />attainable.","Addisen Kameron (2%): 2% I don’t think Clarence<br />Thomas will retire this soon. There were a bunch<br />of talks about Trump repacking the Supreme Court<br />when he got reelected, but there’s no reason to do<br />it this fast. He’ll definitely retire before Trump<br />is out of office since he’s old and they'll want<br />to solidify another conservative in there but he’s<br />got four years for that.","Addisen Kameron (85%): 85% Everything I see<br />puts Scottie Sheffler as the winner followed by<br />Rory Mcilroy which makes me a tad nervous. But<br />my trusted golf expert (my roomie's dad) says<br />Rory always chokes and I’m willing to trust him<br />because I hate golf and know nothing about it.<br />Also the vast majority of Masters winners have<br />been American and while it's shaken up in the last<br />20 years or so, the overwhelming majority have<br />still been American. A lot of rankings place 5 of<br />the top 10 as Americans and I think that’s pretty<br />decent odds.","Addisen Kameron (35%): 35% To be honest, I’m super<br />lost in the chaos right now. I know he signed<br />the TCJA in Nov 2017 which added 1-2 trillion<br />to the deficit and that runs out Dec 31 of year.<br />He’s trying to extend that and with his majority<br />he might be able to, but there’s no point in<br />doing it this fast. I thought he was a lot more<br />confident than he is but he keeps rolling tariffs<br />back like he’s scared, so I don't see him signing<br />anything that big anytime soon. But I’m not at all<br />confident in predicting him so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","Andreas Papandreou (15%): I find it very unlikely<br />due to the fact that there are no reports on<br />Clarence Thomas retiring at this point. The Trump<br />administration has so many different pieces to<br />complete on their agenda and the replacement for<br />Clarence Thomas can happen at any point during<br />this presidency.","Andreas Papandreou (65%): Of the top five players<br />with the best odds to win this tournament, two of<br />them are American. This includes American player<br />Scottie Scheffler who has overwhelmingly the best<br />odds to win in the tournament. As the favorite,<br />Scheffler has the chance to become the fourth<br />back-to-back masters winner, the first since<br />2001-2. Additionally, American Xander Schauffele<br />is tied for the fourth best odds to win as well.<br />Scheffler's is also a large favorite, with odds<br />of +470, while Irish player Rory McIlroy has the<br />second highest odds at +800. Overall, I am leaning<br />towards an American player likely winning the<br />tournament.","Andreas Papandreou (82%): The Trump administration<br />is already at $840 B for their budget deficit as<br />of January. At this same point at the beginning<br />of the Biden presidency the deficit was $736 B.<br />By February of 2021 the deficit had surpassed<br />$1 trillion. The economic policy from the Trump<br />admin, points towards an increase in the deficit.<br />They have extended their 2017 tax cuts and the<br />Department of Government Efficiency has not<br />effectively cut any meaningful spending. With the<br />department stating they have saved over $50 B,<br />but NPR finding that only $2 B has been verifiably<br />cut. With a decrease in revenue and only a limited<br />decrease in spending, I find it very likely that<br />the Trump admin will oversee a budget deficit of<br />over $1 trillion.","Andy Wyatt (3%): Justice retirement announcements<br />usually come either at the beginning of the year<br />or the end of the Court’s term (around July). For<br />instance, Justice Kennedy announced his retirement<br />at the end of June, and Justice O’Connor<br />announced hers at the beginning of July. Justice<br />Thomas has not publicly hinted at an impending<br />retirement. The most important sign that he will<br />return for the court’s next session, starting<br />this October, is that he’s hired a full slate of<br />clerks. His workload has also remained regular.<br />While he was hospitalized in 2022, he seems to<br />otherwise be in good health. On the other hand,<br />the political landscape is ripe for a retirement<br />with Republicans controlling the presidency<br />and Congress. He may also wish to end the close<br />inspection of his ethics and finances, which have<br />caused controversy.","Andy Wyatt (69%): Based on the combined betting<br />odds of various sports books for the American<br />competitors playing at the Masters this year.<br />Scottie Scheffler looks like the strongest<br />contender, hovering around 20% odds while Xander<br />Schauffele, Bryson DeChambeau, and Collin Morikawa<br />are near the top of the pack. However, the volume<br />of American players that have smaller odds of<br />winning also help the overall American odds tick<br />up.","Andy Wyatt (15%): The budget resolution blueprint<br />for reconciliation is the only existing vehicle<br />that would increase the deficit by upward of $1<br />trillion. According to the Wharton Budget Model,<br />the current proposal would add $4.9 trillion<br />to the deficit over a decade. The odds of the<br />reconciliation package passing into law the first<br />100 days are slim. On average, the reconciliation<br />process takes 155 days. Senate Majority Leader<br />John Thune has indicated that the chamber will<br />not take up the House resolution until late this<br />month. After the resolution passes the Senate,<br />legislation must be developed, voted on in both<br />Houses, negotiated in a conference committee, and<br />passed out of each chamber again. That’s a lot<br />that needs to happen before April 28. It can be<br />done, but it’s not likely.","Angela Jacobs (32%): Given that President Trump<br />is in office, the likelihood of Justice Clarence<br />Thomas announcing his retirement before April<br />28 has increased. Justices often time their<br />retirements to allow a party-line president to<br />appoint their successor, ensuring the continuation<br />of their judicial philosophy. At 76, Justice<br />Thomas is the oldest member of the Supreme<br />Court. While the current administration may make<br />retirement more appealing to him, he has not shown<br />any plans of retirement and the timeframe further<br />reduces the likelihood. I would estimate a 32%<br />chance.","Angela Jacobs (81%): Historically, American<br />golfers have had a strong presence at the<br />Masters Tournament, securing 64 victories out<br />of 87 tournaments held since its inception in<br />1934. This dominance is further highlighted<br />by recent performances, with American Scottie<br />Scheffler winning the 2024 Masters. The current<br />Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) features<br />several American golfers in the top positions,<br />including Scottie Scheffler (World No. 1), Xander<br />Schauffele (No. 3), and Patrick Cantlay (No. 5).<br />Their consistent performances on the PGA Tour<br />bolster the likelihood of an American victory.<br />Betting odds from leading sportsbooks reflect<br />this sentiment, with Scottie Scheffler favored<br />to defend his title, holding odds as short as<br />3-1. There's always a chance for an upset, but<br />Americans have a strong edge heading into the<br />event.","Angela Jacobs (15%): Historically, large deficit<br />increases tend to come from major tax cuts or<br />stimulus packages. While Trump has supported both<br />in the past, passing such significant legislation<br />within 100 days would require fast congressional<br />action, which will likely be difficult due to<br />political negotiations and procedural hurdles.<br />Also, given historical precedent, the likelihood<br />of any president signing a bill that increases the<br />deficit by over $1 trillion within the first 100<br />days is very low—probably below 10%. Most major<br />deficit-expanding legislation takes months, if not<br />longer, to pass. I would estimate the probability<br />at 15- possible if there's an urgent push for tax<br />cuts or spending increases, but unlikely within<br />such a short time frame.","Anna Rachwalski (65%): American golfers have<br />won 64 out of 88 Masters Tournaments (73%), and<br />29/50 of the top ranked players going into the<br />Masters are American (58%). 65% hits a good middle<br />between the inside and outside view, and takes<br />into account that 6 of the top ten players are<br />American.","Anna Rachwalski (35%): Moderate Republicans<br />or centrist Democrats would oppose large<br />deficit-increasing measures, and concerns about<br />fiscal responsibility would make it so increasing<br />the deficit would be politically difficult barring<br />a serious financial crisis or need for spending.","Archita Gaur (8%): While Clarence Thomas might<br />announce his retirement during Trump's term, I do<br />not believe that it will happen before April 28th.<br />Ed Whelan, a conservative legal commentator who<br />clerked at the Supreme Court, said that it might<br />actually be Alito who might recite this spring and<br />Thomas who announces in Spring of 2026.","Archita Gaur (68%): Scottie Scheffler is a strong<br />contender as he won the Masters in 2022 and<br />2024. There is another American player, Xander<br />Schauffele, that is also a promising contender.<br />SportsLine’s model, created by DFS pro Mike<br />McClure, has nailed 13 majors, including the<br />2024 Masters and last year’s PGA Championship<br />and U.S. Open. With the 2025 Masters approaching,<br />SportsLine has simulated the tournament 10,000<br />times. This model has favored Scottie Scheffler<br />to win comfortably. I think that there is a strong<br />chance of him winning but I also don't know enough<br />about golf to understand just how much better he<br />his than other players, so I remain skeptical.","Archita Gaur (27%): I do believe that the federal<br />budget deficit will be be more than $1 trillion<br />for this fiscal year due to increased spending by<br />the government, increased overlays, and decreased<br />revenue. However, the chances of Trump signing<br />legislation that will increase the federal budget<br />deficit by $1 trillion in his first 100 days is<br />not probable. GOP just unveiled a new stopgap<br />bill that will fund the federal government till<br />September and provide a slight boost to defense<br />spending. Many speculate that this bill will not<br />have the votes needed. In the House, only one<br />Republican can defect and in the Senate, they need<br />7 Democrats to agree with this bill in order to<br />overcome a filibuster. Even if this bill passes<br />and Trump signs it into law, I don't think it will<br />increase the federal budget deficit by 1 trillion<br />dollars.","Ava Herring (10%): I do not think that Thomas<br />has shown any clear indicators that he will be<br />retiring soon, and he has not shown any signs of<br />any health issues or problems that he might be<br />having that would cause him to step down. Based<br />on the current political standpoint, I believe<br />that it would encourage him to stay on the bench.<br />Although unexpected events can happen, I do not<br />believe that it is likely that he will retire","Ava Herring (45%): I think that an American golfer<br />has a pretty good chance of winning the Masters<br />this year because most of the players that are<br />favored in the betting odds are American as well<br />as most of the field. However, out of the top ten<br />players that have the best odds to win, five are<br />international and five are American.","Ava Herring (40%): Although I do not believe<br />that it is very likely, I believe that there is<br />a chance for this to happen. It would be very<br />difficult for them to pass a bill that would cut<br />one trillion dollars within 100 days, which is why<br />I put my prediction somewhat low. However, based<br />on Trump's past policies, I say that there is<br />still a chance that it could happen.","Ayaan Fazal (1%): I find it almost impossible<br />that Clarence Thomas will retire before April<br />28th. Given that Thomas is the longest serving<br />judge, there is no indication that he will retire.<br />Typically, judges will give some sort of hint or<br />indication that they are about to retire. While<br />there has been speculation regarding potential<br />retirements among senior justices, including<br />Thomas, no official announcements have been made. ​","Ayaan Fazal (70%): I believe that it is highly<br />probable an American will win the Master's this<br />year. Considering from the past 20 winners, 12<br />out of the 20 were American. The strongest golfer<br />this year, Scottie Scheffler has the best odds to<br />win it. I have a good feeling it will be another<br />American this year as well.","Ayaan Fazal (25%): I find it improbable that<br />Trump will pass or sign any legislation that<br />will result into increasing the federal budget<br />by more than $1 trillion. This is largely because<br />the Congressional Budget Office has indicated<br />that achieving certain budgetary goals without<br />cutting major programs like Medicare and Medicaid<br />is challenging. This underscores the difficulty<br />of enacting legislation that would substantially<br />increase the deficit without facing significant<br />political and public resistance.","Bailey Mattox (2%): He has been through scandals<br />and hasn't retired suggesting he won't step down<br />unless either something significant with his<br />health happens or he dies, but this question would<br />still resolve as no if he dies since that would<br />mean he didn't announce his retirement.","Bailey Mattox (85%): In the past Americans have<br />won 73% of all Masters tournaments though in the<br />past 20 years, the percentage of American winners<br />has gone down to 60%. Scheffler is the most likely<br />person to win the tournament based on current<br />predictions and he is an American golfer.","Bailey Mattox (73%): The budget will have to<br />be either raised ( in which case it will pretty<br />much have to be over $1 trillion) or it will be<br />suspended. Neither conservatives nor democrats<br />right now seem to want it to be suspended so I<br />actually think they likely will be able to get a<br />bill passed to raise it, but Trump has supported<br />suspending it before so maybe he will convince<br />the republicans to fall in line and agree to a<br />suspension.","Benjamin Jacobstein (26%): There have been no<br />official announcements or indications of Thomas'<br />plan to step down from the Supreme Court. While<br />it wouldn’t be surprising if, at some point during<br />Trump’s term, there were political pressure for<br />him to retire to allow for a new appointment that<br />ensures a succesor that alligns with MAGA, I do<br />not believe Thomas will announce retirement before<br />April 28. Given the current political climate and<br />Thomas’s consistent alignment with MAGA, it seems<br />unlikely that him nor trump would float the idea<br />of him leaving in the immediate future.","Benjamin Jacobstein (62%): Given the current<br />sports betting probabilities for the Masters and<br />the current nationalist political landscape, it<br />almost feels inevitable that an American will<br />win. With Donald Trump's emphasis on U.S. Sports<br />right now, eagerly promoting the upcoming Olympics<br />and World Cup being hosted in the U.S., his Super<br />Bowl appearance, and his avid love of golf, I can<br />already envision him taking credit for an American<br />golfer’s victory at the Masters. The narrative<br />would play well for ratings and media coverage.<br />While I don’t want to base my prediction purely<br />on intuition, the combination of strong American<br />contenders and the broader cultural climate makes<br />it more likely than not that an American will win.","Benjamin Jacobstein (60%): Bills that I believe<br />might have chance of reaching president Trump's<br />desk before his 100 day mark on April 30 are, the<br />current Government Funding Proposal, the PROVE IT<br />act, and the BIG WIRES act. The current government<br />funding proposal is the most likely of the three<br />to sit on the president's desk even within a<br />matter of the next 4 days to reach the expiration<br />deadline and to avert a government shutdown. I<br />have not found any data from the media or CBO that<br />estimates the impact on the deficit specifically<br />for this proposal, but if it includes an extension<br />of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, it is likely that the<br />proposal will increase the deficit by more than $1<br />trillion over the span of the next 10 years. The<br />PROVE IT act is not likely to have a signifigant<br />impact on the deficit but the BIG WIRES act could,<br />as similar infastructure bills have required a<br />lot of funding. But I think that the real big<br />consideration is dependent on what is included<br />in this upcoming funding proposal, if the funding<br />proposal will actually pass, and if we will even<br />get estimates of the deficit impact by April 30 if<br />it does pass.","Bennie Trujillano (40%): Clarence Thomas has<br />been a supreme court justice for 32 years and<br />is currently the oldest at 78. Considering the<br />average retirement for a justice is 16 years and<br />that he is involved in a variety of controversies,<br />retirement is very much expected. Appointing<br />a new republican supreme court justice is easy<br />brownie points for Trump and it would guarantee<br />a republican justice in the court for decades.<br />There is a lot of pressure on Thomas to retire and<br />I'm 100% confident that Trump will replace Thomas<br />during his term, but when that happens is up to<br />Thomas and I just don't think he is eager to leave<br />so soon.","Bennie Trujillano (60%): Americans have<br />consistently won exactly 60% of the tournaments in<br />the past thirty years while other nations account<br />for 40%. Americans also always make up half of the<br />invitees, including this year. Assuming this year<br />follows the pattern, it is more likely that an<br />American wins.","Bennie Trujillano (60%): Spending is much higher<br />than it was at this time last fiscal year. The<br />deficit has been progressively rising but it's<br />too early to see how it is behaving under Trump's<br />presidency. Historically, the deficit usually<br />reaches over one trillion by April 30th and<br />considering we are closer to that number than<br />previous years, I'd say it's likely.","Brooke Cheney (8%): According to USAToday and<br />Reuters, there have been no factual claims that<br />Clarence plans on retiring. As of current, he has<br />been on the court for 33 years and the longest<br />serving justice served 36 years. Though it looks<br />like his retirement is impending, I do not think<br />it will be in the next month and a half.","Brooke Cheney (78%): Based on current betting<br />odds, Scottie Scheffler, the winner of the 2024<br />Masters who is American, is highly favored to win.<br />However, there are also other candidates looking<br />apt to win such as Northern Irish golfer Rory<br />McIlroy, American golfer Xander Schauffele, and<br />Spanish golfer Jon Rahm. Per Sportsbook Review,<br />these are the top 4 that are highly favored to<br />win as of 3/14. Given two of these golfers are<br />American, I feel more confident we will win.<br />However, since the Masters, like all sports games,<br />is highly unpredictable, I cannot be as certain as<br />I hoped.","Chinelo Ireh (15%): Justice Clarence Thomas is<br />one of the longest serving judges on the Supreme<br />Court, having served for over 33 years. The<br />average tenure on the Court is 16 years so he<br />has definitely beat the odds. He is 76 years old,<br />which is around the age that many justices have<br />sought retirement historically but I doubt that<br />he would want to retire any time soon. He does<br />not have any health issues and does not show signs<br />of wanting to step down. President Trump could<br />appoint younger conservative justices but the<br />trend has been for justices to serve until their<br />last breath. I do not foresee Thomas announcing a<br />retirement before April 28.","Chinelo Ireh (72%): In the history of the Masters<br />Tournament, a majority of the winners have been<br />American. Also, most of the invitees this year are<br />playing for America so it has a higher probability<br />of winning than any other country. The frontrunner<br />in the markets is Scottie Scheffler, who also won<br />the green jacket in 2022. Other potential winners<br />include Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, and Xander<br />Schauffele. Some non-Americans like Jon Rahm<br />and Ludvig Aberg will fight a good fight but the<br />Americans still have the statistical advantage.","Chinelo Ireh (20%): I doubt that President Trump<br />will be able to pass a budgetary measure as<br />drastic as this one within the first 100 days in<br />office because this would require Congressional<br />approval. While Trump’s former and most recent<br />campaigns promised to decrease the federal debt,<br />his first term saw some of the most drastic debt<br />increases in all of American history.","Chloe Cooper (1%): Despite pressures from<br />conservatives to give up his seat on the bench,<br />I think we will get pretty far into Trump's term<br />before Thomas makes any big steps towards planning<br />his retirement. While I do think it's likely that<br />it happens within the next 4 years, it happening<br />in the next 2 MONTHS seems nearly impossible.<br />Thomas has made no indication that he plans on<br />retiring either, so to announce it soon makes<br />zero sense, especially from someone with such a<br />contentious personality like Thomas.","Chloe Cooper (68%): Scottie Scheffler seems to<br />be the clear favorite for the tournament coming<br />up, as the American golfer is well in the #1 spot<br />of the official world golf rankings. Following<br />Scheffler close behind in the rankings are other<br />strong American contenders like Xander Schauffele<br />(#3), Collin Morikawa (#4), and Bryson DeChambau<br />(#16). All four of these golfers are in the top<br />7 for best odds to take the tournament according<br />to FanDual, and with the sheer amount of American<br />players in the competition it seems like the good<br />ole USA has pretty decent odds of taking this one<br />home. Also 5 out of the past 7 masters winners<br />have been American so thats something.","Christian Barr (30%): The probability of Clarence<br />Thomas retiring before April 28 is low. He has<br />dismissed retirement rumors, remains active, and<br />likely wants a conservative successor. With Trump<br />in office, he’s unlikely to step down, as it would<br />shift the Court’s balance.","Da In Song (75%): I do not know golf, but there<br />are 25 american players of the top 50 in 2025.<br />Adding on 20% assuming on of them in 1/50 wins,<br />the total amounts to 75%. Also in ranks 1 and 3<br />are American players, which brings my prediction<br />to 75 even. There might be a chance Mcllory wins.","Da In Song (30%): It seems like the federal<br />deficit budget has already hit 1 trillion,<br />although whether President Trump would sign it<br />into law is a different question. Considering his<br />party platform and the promises he made during<br />his campaign, I don't think Trump would sign for<br />more deficit, although economy may push him to do<br />so. Congress has already allowed for more federal<br />deficit budget making it unecessary for Trump to<br />do so.","Da In Song (20%): I give 20 just in case he has<br />an urgent health issue that forces him to retire.<br />However, there are no signs that he should or<br />would, considering the fact that he managed to<br />stay on despite Trump's re-election. He might<br />retire after the current term, but not during, if<br />his health allows.","Diane Johnson (5%): I find it highly unlikely<br />that Thomas will retire anytime soon. There<br />is seemingly nothing wrong with his mental or<br />physical health and as a conservative he has the<br />government on his side. Since it is so early in<br />Trump’s election, I think that he will try to beat<br />Marshall’s record and stay for the entirety of<br />Trump’s second term just because he can. Then he<br />will leave at the last minute so Trump can appoint<br />another conservative Justice.","Diane Johnson (80%): Out of the current 92<br />invitees that are currently listed, 46 of<br />them are from the United States, meaning if<br />it were completely based on luck the chances<br />of an American winning is already exactly 50%.<br />Furthermore, the #1 ranked player in the world,<br />Scottie Scheffler is +470 to win the Masters for<br />his second time and is an American player. Amongst<br />the top ten golf players in the world, there are<br />three more Americans in the list and although they<br />are ranked in places 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th place, the<br />number of Americans in the tournament elevates the<br />chances.","Eli Henderson (38%): Golf, similar to baseball,<br />is a sport that is difficult to forecast because<br />of the manual difficulty of the sport for the most<br />part. In any case, when looking at most prediction<br />markets, most have Scottie Schefler (USA)<br />favored, but with odds ranging from +430 to +480.<br />Therefore, even though the golfer is favored, +450<br />odds have only an 18% chance of happening, so he<br />doesn't have much of a convincing case. However,<br />with the US fielding the most competitors at 46<br />(>1/2), their odds are increased somewhat, but not<br />above a coin toss.","Eli Henderson (39%): While it would aid in some of<br />the administration’s plans moving forward, I feel<br />as if the aggressive measures being taken by DOGE<br />and the thin margin of majority in congress make<br />it less likely than not to pass within 100 days.<br />However, it wouldn’t be totally unexpected because<br />of the fact there could be government shutdown<br />without it.","Elliana Williams (10%): Though there were rumors<br />about the retirement of Clarence Thomas after<br />the election, it has been fact checked that this<br />is unlikely. People speculate that if he were to<br />retire it would be in 2026. Also, yesterday he<br />said that he wants to revisit a 50 year old court<br />case, which tells me he still wants to serve on<br />the court. There is a chance that he announces<br />retirement, because he is getting up there in age,<br />but I dont know if it will be before the deadline<br />because he is currently active and seems to be<br />engaged in the legislative process.","Elliana Williams (60%): Scottie Scheffler is<br />favored to win back to back Masters on all sites<br />I visited, and since he is from the US, that made<br />me start with a super high percentage. However<br />not all the next top people favored are not from<br />the US. Though the odds for Scheffler are very<br />high, in the past years, the betting odds for the<br />winners in hindidight were off, and people not<br />projected to win ended up winning. My prediction<br />would be much higher if the betting markets were<br />more accurate in previous years, but it seems the<br />projected winner is not always who actually wins.","Elliana Williams (52%): The Congressional Budget<br />Office forecasts a federal budget deficit of<br />$1.865 trillion for 2025. It has been shown<br />that recent budget proposals and fiscal policies<br />suggest that significant deficit increases<br />are being considered, it is just a question of<br />will the deficit increases be passed before the<br />deadline.","Emma Allen (22%): As of today, there is no public<br />information indicating that Supreme Court Justice<br />Clarence Thomas plans to announce his retirement<br />before April 28, 2025. If anything I see him<br />finishing out this Supreme Court term which<br />sessions go into June/July and term ends early<br />October. Not denying Thomas won’t retire during<br />Trump’s presidency, but I think it is unlikely he<br />chooses to retire within Trump’s first 6 months.<br />Historically speaking, it doesn't seem like it<br />is often SC justices announce retirement so early<br />into a presidency change.","Emma Allen (42%): While no legislation has yet<br />been signed into law increasing the deficit by<br />more than $1 trillion within the first 100 days,<br />the administration's proposals (particularly tax<br />cuts and potential spending increases) suggest<br />that substantial deficit growth could be on the<br />horizon. The extent of the impact will depend<br />on whether these policies are enacted. I do not<br />think the Republican controlled congress will<br />pass enough of Trump’s proposed policies over the<br />next 100 days to add to the deficit by this large<br />amount.","Emma Pastor (10%): With all things considered, I<br />predict that the probability of Clarence Thomas<br />announcing his retirement from the Supreme Court<br />by April 28th is around 10 percent. Although I<br />foresee his retirement in the upcoming year or<br />two, if at all, I do not expect him to announce<br />these plans in the next couple of months. He very<br />well has the opportunity to become the longest<br />serving justice on the court in history if he opts<br />not to retire in the next two years, and I would<br />not be surprised if this was the route he decides<br />to take.","Emma Pastor (75%): Given that an American has<br />won the Master’s Tournament 60 out of the last<br />90 times the tournament has occurred in history,<br />that puts fire of this focusing at around 2/3<br />right off the bat. In the past 10 years, 4 non<br />Americans have won, still putting odds around 60%.<br />Last years winner, an American, is returning to<br />the competition and is currently favored to win,<br />alongside a few other Americans, heightening the<br />change that one of them wins.","Emma Pastor (40%): While President Trump’s<br />proposed “big beautiful bill” currently would<br />increase the United States’s federal budget<br />deficit by over a trillion dollars per fiscal<br />year, the question really comes down to when this<br />huge, all encompassing budget bill will be passed<br />by the Senate. While some Republican lawmakers<br />think that the bill should be passed sooner rather<br />than later, predicting it sometime before Easter,<br />others are less optimistic, predicting out to<br />memorial day at the earliest.","Emma Peterson (5%): I put 5% because Clarence<br />Thomas has never given any indication he's looking<br />to retire any time soon. As we saw with RBG, some<br />justices stay on the Supreme Court until they<br />pass, or until a health crisis forces them to<br />retire. Clarence Thomas is 76 years old and the<br />average age of retirement is about 80 for SCOTUS.<br />I do believe he'd retire in the next few years,<br />but by April 28 I just don't see it happening.","Emma Peterson (65%): I said 65% because the top<br />player in the world right now and former Masters<br />winner Scottie Scheffler is predicted to win<br />again. Also, in the world golf ranking, we have<br />6 American's in the top 10. Putting both of these<br />odds together I believe we have a stronger chance<br />of taking home a win at the Masters.","Emma Peterson (40%): There has been talk since<br />February to increase the federal budget deficit,<br />along with extending tax cuts which has been<br />outlined in a House budget blueprint. There are<br />plans to increase the deficit by $2.8 trillion.<br />While I do think this is possible and something<br />Trump will sign into legislation, I don't see<br />it happening in the first 100 days, because some<br />things outlined in the bill have caused uproar<br />from both sides.","Ethan Joyce (2%): I don't think he has any reason<br />to resign prior to the 28th. That being said he<br />may retire before Trump's term ends so that the<br />Republicans can replace him while they have a<br />trifecta. There aren't any polymarket or kalshi<br />markets on this as far as I can tell either. There<br />hasn't been any pressing news to suggest that this<br />will happen either. Its also in the middle of the<br />supreme court session right now I think.","Ethan Joyce (68%): Approximately 48% of the<br />2025 Masters invitees are American, meaning they<br />would have a 48% chance of winning if all players<br />had equal skill. Historically, Americans have<br />won around 60% of recent Masters tournaments<br />(since 2000). Additionally, six of the top<br />ten betting favorites are American, including<br />Scottie Scheffler, the clear frontrunner, along<br />with Schauffele, DeChambeau, Morikawa, Koepka,<br />and Thomas. This estimate reflects both the<br />high representation of American players and the<br />strength of top contenders based on the historical<br />performance of American players and betting odds.","Ethan Joyce (45%): I calculated a combined<br />probability of approximately 45% that President<br />Trump signs into law legislation increasing the<br />federal budget deficit by more than $1 trillion<br />within his first 100 days, as scored by the<br />CBO within a 10-year window and reported by<br />major media outlets. This estimate accounts for<br />the likelihood of a bill existing (e.g., TCJA<br />extension), passing Congress by April 29, 2025,<br />and being scored above $1 trillion.","Ethan Marcum (30%): While I think he is<br />prioritizing cutting and change, I do not feel<br />he will make it that drastic quite yet. He has<br />shown that he is putting priority in other ways<br />of handling said deficit. I also feel that there<br />are more pressing issues that he will hopefully be<br />focused on.","Grace Mccann (10%): Clarence Thomas has stated<br />multiple times recently that he has no plans to<br />retire. Also since Trump just got elected even if<br />he wanted Clarence Thomas to retire so he could<br />fill that seat there is no rush to do it anytime<br />soon. It would make sense for him to retire later<br />in Trump's term so he could put a fresh republican<br />in before his time runs out.","Grace Mccann (78%): I have a lot of confidence is<br />Scottie Scheffler. I think he will have a repeat.<br />He has done extremely well recently and even won<br />an olympic gold metal. He does have some fierce<br />completion but he has beaten all of them and I am<br />confident he will do it again.","Grace Mccann (40%): President Trump has expressed<br />an intention to reduce deficits and foster<br />economic growth. However, his early agenda has<br />not prominently included specific legislative<br />proposals with clear fiscal impacts. Historically,<br />major tax cuts, like those passed during his first<br />term, have been linked to an increase in deficits.","Grace Reichelderfer (33%): I do not think Clarence<br />Thomas will resign before April 28th. Justice<br />Thomas is 76 years old and has served on the<br />Supreme Court since 1991. However Justice Thomas<br />has repeatedly denied retirement rumors heading<br />back to 2019. Now that there is a Republican<br />president in office for the next 4 years, I don’t<br />see any reason why Justice Thomas would retire at<br />the very beginning of Trump’s term. Realistically,<br />I believe he will retire before the end of Trump’s<br />term, but that is almost 4 years away. I do not<br />see Justice Thomas retiring in the next 2 months.","Grace Reichelderfer (60%): Since 2015, there<br />has been 6 American Master’s champions and 4<br />non-American champions. In the current Official<br />World Golf Ranking, 6 of the top 10 player’s are<br />American, with Scottie Scheffler leading. With<br />that being said, for my prediction I am going to<br />stick with 60%. Scottie is going to be the guy to<br />beat for arguably the third year in a row. He is<br />playing fantastic golf and has seemed to be a step<br />above everyone else, specifically in majors, over<br />the past year or two. I would not be surprised<br />at all to see him win his third Masters. However,<br />Augusta National is known for being challenging<br />and unpredictable and I believe the results will<br />be no different.","Grace Reichelderfer (28%): The only scenario<br />that the budget deficit increases by more than 1<br />trillion dollars by April 28th is if Trump’s “one<br />big beautiful bill” gets signed into law. It is<br />too close to the deadline for another bill to be<br />brought up, negotiated, passed in both the House<br />and Senate, and then signed by the President.<br />However, the “one big beautiful bill” has already<br />passed in the House. However, based on news<br />reports, it seems Senate republicans are not in<br />a rush to take this bill to the floor. The Senate<br />may not take it up until mid-April or beyond,<br />according to interviews with multiple Republican<br />senators and aides. For that reason, it seems<br />unlikely that this bill will be signed by April<br />28th.","Hampton Barrineau (15%): While I believe it is<br />likely that Clarence Thomas will announce his<br />retirement during Trump‘s term, I think it is<br />very unlikely that he will announce it within this<br />year. Elections are far off in November of next<br />year so there is plenty of time for him to wait on<br />this issue, and there has been little sign of such<br />considerations so far.","Hampton Barrineau (65%): An American, Scheffler,<br />is predicted to win the tournament and he is the<br />previous winner too. Additionally it looks like<br />roughly half of competition are Americans, but<br />considering how large the playing field is, I can<br />see a potential upset and or dark house winner.","Hampton Barrineau (100%): Looking right now, at<br />the proposed Republican budget and frankly Donald<br />Trump’s history, considering his last term, it<br />is a certainty that he will increase deficit,<br />despite talk of financial responsibility. There<br />is a little reason to believe Republicans will not<br />increase the death.","Hannah Carson (10%): I believe this because he is<br />extremely close to the record for longest serving<br />justice of all time and I believe he will wait 5<br />years to obtain that title. Also, Justice Thomas<br />has made statements saying he is not planning on<br />retiring anytime soon. Additionally, the strong<br />Republican majority in court takes off pressure<br />for Clarence Thomas to retire so President Trump<br />can elect a younger Republican justice.","Hannah Carson (40%): The betting odds right now<br />are saying Scottie Scheffler is going to win.<br />However, Scottie has already won one Master's<br />tournament and I don't feel like he is going<br />to win another. My bet is on Ludvig Aberg. He's<br />a young golfer from Sweden and has great short<br />game and putting consistency. Because of this,<br />I feel like he has a real chance at the Master's<br />tournament although I am unsure because there is<br />a lot of great American golfers in this year's<br />tournament as well.","Hannah Carson (20%): I believe President Trump<br />won't increase the federal budget deficit by more<br />than 1 trillion in the first 100 days. First of<br />all, it takes a long time to pass legislation and<br />we are already a good way into the first 100 days<br />in office. Although he has pushed tax cuts and<br />defense spending, he has also proposed cutting<br />1 trillion from government spending in ways of<br />cutting DEI and other \"unnecessary\" government<br />expenses. In Trump's last term he passes the CARES<br />ACT which increased the deficit by 1.8 trillion,<br />but that was under COVID and the act was necessary<br />to stimulate the economy in a way that is no<br />longer necessary in 2025.","Isaac Fleischer (7%): There has been no indication<br />that Clarence Thomas plans to retire. Though he<br />will most likely retire within the coming years,<br />the short time frame to the end of the semester<br />makes it unlikely that he will retire during the<br />specified window. With trump in office, there is<br />now less pressure for Thomas to stay on the court.<br />Still, it is relatively unlikely that he will<br />retire before April 28","Isaac Fleischer (62%): Most of the top ranked<br />golfers are American. There are a handful of<br />international golfers who have good odds to win<br />the masters, such as Rory McIlroy, however 11 of<br />the top 20 ranked pga golfers (according to cbs)<br />are American. Additionally, the American golfers<br />are concentrated towards the top of the list,<br />meaning they have better odds over all.","Isaac Fleischer (25%): Though the federal deficit<br />budget is likely to increase over president<br />Trump’s term, the short time frame makes it<br />relatively unlikely that one trillion dollars will<br />be added by the end of the semester. An increase<br />to the federal deficit budget will likely occur<br />later on in Trump’s presidency.","Isabella Molina (60%): A lot of the top players in<br />the Masters this year are American, like Scottie<br />Scheffler, who has the best odds to win. There<br />are other notable American golfers there that<br />gives it a good shot for them to win. Americans<br />have historically done well at Augusta so, I’d say<br />there’s about a 60% chance an American wins this<br />year.","Isabella Molina (15%): At tis moment it seems<br />trump is big on cutting funding for many and stop<br />increasing any funds. Even though Trump likes<br />tax cuts and military spending, Republicans don’t<br />always like big deficits. It’s possible, but not<br />very likely, that a bill adding over $1 trillion<br />to the deficit gets signed in the first 100<br />days. Trump seems much more focused also on other<br />projects then addressing this within his first 100<br />days.","Jacob Weiss (35%): There have no rumors that<br />supreme court justice Clarence Thomas is going<br />to retire nearly immediately. He is past the<br />average time serving and more than likely will<br />retire under the trump administration so he can<br />be replaced by a conservative judge just not<br />immediately.","Jacob Weiss (15%): Congress is currently working<br />to create a new budget. With the Republican<br />party primarily supporting the cuts of doge<br />most Republicans would rather cut spending than<br />increase it. Many Republicans have mentioned that<br />they would only vote for a budget if the budget<br />stays in the 2024 spending. Trump doesn't have<br />the power of the purse so this is really up to<br />Congress.","Jake Garrard (15%): I believe it is unlikely that<br />Clarence Thomas will announce his retirement from<br />the Supreme Court before April 28th, there have<br />been no indications that he is planning to do so.<br />Usually, justices retire at the end of a term,<br />which in this case won't be until June. If he were<br />to retire soon, he would likely hold out until<br />closer to the end of the term to announce it,<br />which would be after April 28th.","Jake Garrard (43%): Through my research and<br />previous golf knowledge, I believe the chances<br />of an American winning the Masters this year lies<br />just below 50%, at 43%. Although, an American is<br />favored to win the tournament, some very unlikely<br />odds would have to be overcome for him to win.<br />With the amount of international golfers ranking<br />so highly this year and performing so well, I<br />think there is a slightly higher chance that a<br />player born outside the U.S. wins the tournament<br />this year. However, it is nearly impossible to<br />guess who will win the event in any given year, as<br />golfers often appear out of nowhere to win events<br />and golf is a very inconsistent sport when it<br />comes to who wins, other than a few players.","Jake Garrard (67%): President Trump is working<br />very quickly to push his agenda during his second<br />term. Seeing that during his first term, the<br />federal budget deficit was raised by well over $1<br />trillion, specifically with the Tax Cuts and Jobs<br />Act of 2017 and the economic downturn during the<br />COVID-19 pandemic. If the debt ceiling issue is<br />not addressed soon, the U.S. will default on it's<br />debts, having major negative impacts in the U.S.<br />economy and it's standing in the world.","Jenny Qiu (15%): Clarence Thomas is the oldest<br />sitting judge at 76 years old, but the average age<br />of retirement for Supreme Court Justices is 81.<br />There has also been no implication stemming from<br />Thomas himself that creates speculation that he is<br />planning to retire. Most talks currently come from<br />people who wants Trump to be able to assign new<br />justices. Since Thomas was assigned by W. Bush, he<br />is conservative and would likely retire during a<br />Republican White House, creating a little chance<br />during Trump's presidency. However, before April<br />28th is a very short time frame.","Jenny Qiu (76%): Masters has been won by an<br />American approximately 73% of all the years in<br />its history, but this may be inflated due to the<br />fact that it started off as a national event in<br />the U.S. If we disregard the years before the<br />first foreign golfer won, it goes down to 62.5%.<br />However, the top contender to win happens to be<br />Scottie Scheffler, who is American. He is current<br />ranked one on Official World Golf Ranking, has won<br />Masters 2022 and 2024, won Olympic gold in men's<br />individual golf, and has many other great recent<br />achievements. The runner-up contender is Rory<br />McIlroy, who is Irish.","Jenny Qiu (25%): The federal budget deficit<br />increases when spending exceeds revenue. However,<br />so far we have seen a lot of efforts to cut<br />spending, especially with the newly established<br />Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which<br />its purpose is to reduce the deficit. There have<br />been mass government worker layoffs and budget<br />cuts, especially in the Department of Education<br />and Department of Agriculture. It would be<br />counterintuitive for Trump to sign legislation<br />that would increase the deficit by more than $1<br />trillion.","Jerusalem Greenberg (40%): A TRILLION dollars?<br />Do I think Donald Trump will increase the deficit<br />by over a TRILLION? No. Do I think he absolutely<br />will increase the deficit, absolutely, but by that<br />much would be disgustingly absurd. He would quite<br />literally have to increase the budget deficit by<br />more than 50% of its current amount, a feat that<br />would have monstrous consequences on the state of<br />our country if we attempted that. There's no way.","Jessy Lee (10%): I believe it is unlikely Clarence<br />Thomas will announce his retirement before April<br />28. While there is speculation over his age,<br />health concerns, and political/media pressure,<br />he has publicly denied and shut down rumors of<br />his retirement. The Washington Post reports that<br />justices are often the subject of retirement<br />rumors spread by those hoping for a younger<br />candidate to take their place, especially when<br />a president with similar political views has the<br />opportunity to nominate a replacement. Therefore,<br />I think it is highly unlike","Jessy Lee (35%): It's possible that President<br />Trump will sign legislation within his first<br />100 days that contributes to an increase in the<br />federal budget deficit. However, whether this<br />increase will exceed $1 trillion is uncertain,<br />as it depends on the specifics and timing of the<br />enacted policies. I think it is likely that Trump<br />signs legislation for an increase in the federal<br />budget by $1 trillion but not within his first 100<br />days.","Joey Khashan (3%): Considering that the average<br />age of retirement for a Supreme Court Justice is<br />79, I think that it is unlikely that a man who<br />has served the second-longest term of any Supreme<br />Court Justice in history will retire prior to<br />reaching that average age of retirement. There is<br />a possibility that a medical emergency will happen<br />that will force him into retirement, or maybe<br />another reason, but I do not believe that he will<br />announce his retirement on his own terms any time<br />soon.","Joey Khashan (67%): By adding up all the betting<br />odds of each American participating in the Masters<br />this year, you are left with a 74.5% chance that<br />they will win. However, upon further investigation<br />into how many Americans were invited to play<br />in the Masters as well as the number of top 50<br />golfers in the world that are American, I put the<br />odds of an American winning around a 67% chance.","Joshua Kang (7%): There has been no public<br />indications that Clarence Thomas is planning on<br />retirement before April 28. The only stipulation<br />is that Thomas potentially could retire early in<br />order to ensure his successor is aligned with the<br />Trump administration's goals. Considering there<br />are no public","Joshua Kang (22%): The timeline for Trump's \"big,<br />beautiful tax plan\", that chiefly consists of<br />an extension of his tax cuts in his first term,<br />is uncertain. Republican infighting is slowing<br />progress. I would say it's unlikely it's passed<br />in April. If it is passed, I find it unlikely to<br />see the immediate effects of it on the deficit by<br />April 28.","Julia Loggins (83%): Americans win the Masters<br />tournament approximately 72.4% of the time<br />claiming 63 wins. In the Masters tournament<br />coming up, Scottie Scheffler is predicted to<br />win. However, I am not going higher because he is<br />closely followed by Rory Mcllroy. Scottie is the<br />defending champion and currently has +400 odds<br />which makes me believe based on current news and<br />how often Americans win that an American will win<br />again.","Julia Loggins (30%): I do not think Trump will<br />sign into law legislation that increases the<br />federal budget deficit by more than $1 trillion.<br />Major bills such as this usually take a lot of<br />time to negotiate. In addition, some Republican<br />lawmakers may resist such large increases causing<br />the timeline to increase. Some legislation can<br />pass with a simple majority, but debate and<br />amendments can still delay this. I do think it is<br />highly possible for him to push deficit-increasing<br />policies, I just believe that the timeline is too<br />short.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (10%): I think it is unlikely<br />that Clarence Thomas will announce his retirement<br />before April 28th. He is now the longest serving<br />current Supreme Court Justice and I don't believe<br />he has shown any intention of stepping down<br />within the next month and a half. I believe that<br />Trump being in office gives him more incentive<br />to step down because he would be replaced by a<br />conservative candidate, however I believe the<br />decision will ultimately depend on his personal<br />circumstances and not external pressures. It is<br />difficult to predict because it could come down<br />to whether he feels ready or not but I just have<br />a feeling he will stick around a bit longer,<br />possibly when things in Trump's administration are<br />a bit more stable.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (70%): I feel more certain that<br />an American will win the Masters this year than<br />not. Currently, three American contenders have<br />a considerable shot according to numerous sports<br />betting and forecasting sites. Additionally,<br />out of the previous 20 Masters Tournaments, an<br />American has won 12 times. I know nothing about<br />golf so this is probably a really ill informed<br />guess.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (60%): I am not very confident<br />in my prediction of Trump signing legislation to<br />increase the federal budget deficit by more than<br />$1 trillion, however, the GOP has been moving<br />very quickly since Trump took office and the<br />first 100 days are historically the best time to<br />pass legislation before midterm elections. Also,<br />Republicans may utilize budget reconciliation<br />similarly to how they did in 2017 in order to<br />bypass the Senate filibuster.","Kelsey Dyar (10%): I believe that there is a 10%<br />chance that Clarence Thomas will retire before<br />April 28th. The timing, especially, is what led me<br />to this decision. It is hard to say whether Thomas<br />will back down and do what Trump wants him to.<br />In my research of Thomas, he seems to be set in<br />what he wants. However, he has been bribed before<br />by billionaire donors so if Trump can find a way<br />to bribe him, I don’t think it’s unlikely that<br />he takes it. Although he may eventually retire<br />(either before the Midterms or before the 2028<br />Presidential Election), I do not think it will<br />happen before April 28th.","Kyle Smith (80%): I believe there is a very strong<br />chance there will be an American who wins the<br />Masters this year but there has been poor playing<br />from some of the USAs favorites such as Scottie<br />Scheffler and Rory Mcclroy. 15 out of the last 25<br />masters winners have been american but this does<br />not mean much as that was during the time of Tiger<br />Woods and Phil Mickelson.","Kyle Smith (30%): I find it very unlikely that<br />Trump will sign a bill that will increase the<br />deficit by 1 trillion. Although it is definitely<br />possible, there are current disagreements between<br />th house and senate that could negatively impact<br />that possibility. That on top of it being only<br />within 100 days, I say this will most likely not<br />happen.","Lawton Smith (20%): I do not think that Clarence<br />Thomas will announce his retirement this early.<br />The fact that he is 76 years old and his tenure on<br />the Supreme Court has been long and memorable, I<br />believe that since in 2028 he could be the longest<br />serving supreme court justice , I just don't see<br />while this early in Trumps presidency that he<br />announces his retirement.","Lawton Smith (80%): Based on the analysis of<br />current betting odds, historical performance,<br />expert predictions, and statistical models, an<br />American winner of the 2025 Masters Tournament<br />appears to be the most probable outcome. Scottie<br />Scheffler stands as the clear individual favorite,<br />but the collective strength of the American<br />contingent creates multiple pathways to an<br />American victory. While international players like<br />McIlroy, Aberg, and Rahm cannot be discounted,<br />the weight of evidence suggests that the green<br />jacket will likely remain with an American golfer<br />following the final round at Augusta National in<br />April.","Lawton Smith (10%): Trump’s first 100 days in<br />his current term would span from January 20,<br />2025 (inauguration) to approximately April 29,<br />2025. Given that Monday is March 10, 2025, we<br />are roughly 50 days into his term. No definitive<br />legislation increasing the deficit by over $1<br />trillion has been signed into law yet, based<br />on publicly available data. However, proposals<br />under consideration could potentially lead to<br />such an outcome if enacted within the remaining<br />time frame. But , during Trump's first term,<br />significant deficit increases were typically<br />spread over years rather than concentrated in a<br />short period. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs<br />Act of 2017 added $1.9 trillion to deficits over<br />11 years, not immediately","Levi Thomas (10%): Though he is the<br />longest-serving member of the Supreme Court,<br />Justice Thomas is far from the oldest justice to<br />serve on the Court. This means it would not be out<br />of the ordinary to see him serve out a few more<br />years before he considers retirement. Furthermore,<br />Justice Thomas has been active on pushing the<br />current Court's conservative agenda, something<br />tat plays well with the current administration.<br />If Thomas were to resign in order to preserve the<br />future of a conservative majority Court, it would<br />likely be later in the Trump presidency.","Levi Thomas (80%): Americans have historically had<br />great success at the Masters. There is a general<br />advantage in the fact that American players are<br />typically more familiar with the Augusta course<br />than international players, and there is simply<br />an overwhelming majority of American competitors.<br />International players have been winning more<br />frequently, but Americans are still the huge<br />favorite.","Lillie Puhrmann (5%): The chances of Justice<br />Clarence Thomas announcing his retirement before<br />April 28 are pretty slim, probably around 5% or<br />even lower. No reliable reports or statements<br />indicate that he intends to resign anytime soon.<br />In the past, Thomas has brushed off any talk about<br />retirement, and even at 76, he is still active<br />on the Court. Also, since there’s a conservative<br />majority right now, he probably doesn’t feel much<br />pressure to retire soon, so it seems unlikely that<br />he would make a sudden announcement.","Lillie Puhrmann (60%): The estimated probability<br />of an American winning the 2025 Masters Tournament<br />is 60%, according to the current betting odds.<br />This is because of the talent of top American<br />golfers such as Scottie Scheffler, Xander<br />Schauffele, and Bryson DeChambeau, who are<br />considered favorites. Still, international players<br />like Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm are definitely<br />strong contenders. Even though Americans have<br />done really well at Augusta in the past, golf can<br />be pretty unpredictable. Things like the course<br />conditions and how players are performing will<br />really decide what happens in the end.","Mabry Cartwright (20%): Clarence Thomas is<br />the longest serving Supreme Court Justice and<br />there has been speculation around his possible<br />retirement. However, I do not believe we will see<br />this happening before April 28. All of the reports<br />I have read state that there is no evidence of<br />a retirement announcement. Also, if he was going<br />to retire before April, I believe he would have<br />announced this decision earlier.","Mabry Cartwright (60%): I believe that an American<br />will win the Masters because Scottie Scheffler is<br />currently the number one golfer in the World and<br />he is the predicted winner with +470 odds. Another<br />American who is moving up in the predictions is<br />Collin Morikawa, who placed third at the 2024<br />Masters. However, I am placing it low on the yes<br />side because Rory Mcllroy is currently taking the<br />second place for greatest chance at a win. He is<br />an Irish golfer with an impressive background,<br />but he does not have a great track record at the<br />Masters.","Mabry Cartwright (40%): I am placing this<br />probability at 40% due to the time frame of the<br />question. I believe that cooperation from Congress<br />might take longer than 100 days and this might<br />not be at the top of the list of priorities for<br />President Trump. I do believe this will be an<br />act that he pushes for, but not within the first<br />100 days. However, I am not going lower than 40%<br />because President Trump has already made many<br />changes in his short period in office.","Margaret Pope (10%): There has been no indication<br />from Justice Clarence Thomas about his plans to<br />retire, specifically any time soon. With the Trump<br />Administration just joining office, I find it<br />likely that Justice Thomas will serve a minimum of<br />one more year before retiring. The Supreme Court<br />has a full docket in this upcoming months, so I<br />find it highly unlikely Justice Thomas retires<br />before the end of the April term.","Margaret Pope (51%): There is a wide array<br />of talent in the upcoming Masters tournament.<br />Although there are many Americans competing, and<br />they could probably swing the win, I find it less<br />likely than not that an American wins due to the<br />vast talent and wide range of other people playing<br />in the tournament. More specifically, people such<br />as Rory Mcllroy.","Margaret Pope (33%): April 30 marks the first<br />100 days of Trumps presidency. Due to how quickly<br />that date is arriving, it seems unlikely he will<br />be signing any legislation that increases the<br />federal budget deficit. The makeup of Congress<br />is extremely polarized right now, and although<br />many Republicans and Trump may support certain<br />legislation that could increase the deficit, I<br />find it unlikely they will pass anything with such<br />a short deadline.","Maston Corn (24%): Clarence Thomas is the oldest<br />Supreme Court Justice and the longest-serving<br />member on the Supreme Court. At this age and<br />with Donald Trump in office with the ability<br />to nominate a Republican to take the place of<br />Clarence Thomas, one would think Justice Thomas<br />would step down so that a Republican could<br />remain in his place. However, in an interview<br />in 2019, Clarence Thomas said that he has no<br />plans of retirement and plans to serve another<br />20 to 30 years. He is in good health mentally<br />and physically as far as we know, and I do not<br />believe that he would retire this early into<br />Donald Trump's presidency. I believe that the<br />probability would be higher, but it is unlikely<br />he would retire within the first 100 days of this<br />presidency.","Maston Corn (61%): Historically, Americans<br />preform extremely well at The Masters due to<br />the weather and the familiarity with the course.<br />Additionally, America stresses the importance of<br />golf more than other sports which allows them a<br />larger pool of players to draw from. Americans and<br />international players in recent years have played<br />very competitively against each other and in the<br />top 5 players in the world, only 2 are Americans.<br />However, Americans have played very well in the<br />past few tournaments, and they are favored to win<br />over international players. The weather will also<br />favor Americans until they get further into the<br />tournament. It is likely that the Americans will<br />win, however, I could see Rory McIlroy beating<br />Scottie Scheffler in the tournament.","Maston Corn (28%): The only piece of legislation<br />that has the potential to be signed into law<br />and increase the deficit by $1 trillion is the<br />2025 Budget Resolution that is currently in<br />reconciliation to merge the Senate and House<br />drafts of the resolution. The resolution is<br />usually never finalized before the deadline<br />of April 15th due to increased polarization<br />in Congress. In the last 49 fiscal years, the<br />resolution missed the deadline 30 times. The<br />only way that the legislation can be finalized<br />before April 30th, which is the end of the first<br />100 days, is because of the Republican trifecta,<br />however, even in the last trifecta they were not<br />able to finalize the budget in time.","Matthew Newby (5%): Based on the research I did<br />regarding this question I do not think it is<br />likely that Clarence Thomas will retire before<br />April 28th. When looking up this question I found<br />no evidence that he plans to retire within the<br />next month. Although he is 76 years old and has<br />served in the supreme court since 1991, there<br />is just no evidence supporting his retirement<br />happening in a month.","Matthew Newby (35%): Even though the Masters field<br />is almost half American, I think that there is<br />only a 35% chance an american wins it. While 3<br />out of the top 4 golfers in the world are american<br />when it comes to tournaments like the Masters<br />its essentially who is playing the best golf for<br />4 days, ranking doesn't really tell you anything<br />except for prior achievements. Personally, I think<br />is Rory Mccilroy can improve his putting before<br />the Masters begins he will have the highest chance<br />of winning as he has been playing very well this<br />season.","Matthew Newby (15%): I do not think it is likely<br />that president Trump will increase the federal<br />budget defecit by more than 1 trillion within his<br />first 100 days of office. I think that this will<br />eventually happen during his presidency but given<br />the short amount of time in this question I think<br />it is more than likely not going to happen.","Meera Srinivasan (3%): I find it extremely<br />unlikely that Clarence Thomas will step down as a<br />justice of the Supreme Court of the United States<br />before April 28. Thomas has shown no indication of<br />stepping down, and to announce his retirement now<br />would be extremely out of character.","Meera Srinivasan (55%): It appears that American<br />player Scottie Scheffler is favored to win the<br />Masters Tournament by many, given his status as<br />defending champion. From outside view, there are<br />45 American players and 88 total players, with<br />over 50% being American. Though I do not believe<br />it is guaranteed an American will win, I think it<br />is fairly likely.","Meera Srinivasan (35%): Though I think it is<br />possible, given the majorities held by Republicans<br />in both chambers, those majorities are also slim,<br />especially in the House. I do not think this<br />is unlikely to happen at all, but I do find it<br />unlikely to happen in the first 100 days.","Mia Pisani (12%): Justice Clarence Thomas is<br />a highly controversial member of the Supreme<br />Court. Recently, he has been criticized for his<br />nondisclosure of finances, primarily gifts from<br />Harlan Crow. On January 3, 2025, the United States<br />Judicial Conference denied the requests of Senator<br />Sheldon Whitehouse, Senator Ron Wyden, and United<br />States District Judge Robert Conrad to refer<br />Thomas to the Justice Department on the grounds<br />of ethics violations. Due to this protection by<br />the United States Judicial Conference, I find<br />it unlikely this controversy would lead him to<br />retirement. The main reason Thomas may retire<br />would be to protect the conservative majority on<br />the Supreme Court. If he were to retire, he would<br />likely be replaced by a younger, conservative<br />justice. However, Justice Thomas has limited<br />reasons to retire before April 28th. He has no<br />illness or indicators he will die before then, and<br />even if he does, President Trump will still be in<br />office to appoint a young, conservative justice to<br />replace him. There is no rush for Justice Thomas,<br />especially since his controversies seem well<br />behind him.","Mia Pisani (72%): Scottie Scheffler is currently<br />predicted to win the Masters, which would make him<br />the first champion to win back-to-back since Tiger<br />Woods in 2002. Rory McIlroy trails Scheffler as<br />the number 2 ranked golfer in the world. McIlroy,<br />Ludvig Adberg, and Xander Schauffele are also<br />contenders, however many sports betting sites<br />prefer Scheffler. Historically, Americans perform<br />better at the Masters; Americans have won 63/87<br />since the Masters began. Scheffler is experienced<br />on this range, as he has played in the Masters 4<br />times, his most recent resulting in a win.","Mia Pisani (14%): During President Trump's first<br />presidency, major federal budget increases were<br />due to the pandemic. The Congressional Budget<br />Office projects the deficit will increase<br />by billions, but a trillion is unlikely.<br />Additionally, President Trump has emphasized<br />the importance of curbing wasteful spending<br />as he established the Department of Government<br />Efficiency, which has an \"ambitious goal of<br />cutting $1 trillion in federal spending by<br />the end of the fiscal year in September,\" per<br />NPR. Congress is also very polarized, making<br />legislation of this size unlikely to reach Trump's<br />desk.","Milan Yadav (7%): There is very little to no<br />evidence of Thomas retiring or even hinting at<br />retiring. Justice Breyer was the last justice<br />to retire, and he did so at 83. Many of Thomas'<br />fellow justices have said he is a great person<br />to be around as well, and he does not complain<br />or call out others when he disagrees. With the<br />republican majority in the Senate, it’s unlikely<br />that the decisions of the court would largely<br />change from the way they are right now, so Thomas<br />retiring before 2028 would not make a major<br />difference anyway. If Thomas does retire, it will<br />certainly not be in the next 2 months but rather<br />closer to 2028 when Trump heads out of office.","Milan Yadav (65%): Scottie Scheffler is a favorite<br />to win the tournament this year. He has been on a<br />positive streak this season and is currently world<br />#1 in golf. He already won the Masters in '22 and<br />'24 so he has a decent chance of winning it again<br />next month from that alone. Other Americans like<br />Schauffele and DeChambeau and Morikawa can also<br />very much win it.","Milan Yadav (8%): House Republicans have proposed<br />a seven-month funding patch that re-allocates<br />existing funds but does not introduce new spending<br />that would increase the deficit. Right now, it<br />seems as though most of Congress is focused on<br />re-allocating existing money rather than adding<br />more money. Also, current inflation risks make it<br />very hard to increase the budget deficit.","Nathaniel Long (34%): Clarence Thomas is the<br />Supreme Court's oldest and longest-serving member,<br />being appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991. As<br />he is conservative, it was predicted that he would<br />likely announce his retirement during Trump's<br />presidency if he were to win, so Trump could<br />replace him with another conservative justice.<br />While it is likely Thomas will retire during<br />Trump's term as president, there is no evidence<br />to his retirement before April 28th of this year,<br />and it is more likely he will hold out until the<br />second half of Trump's term to effectively buy<br />slightly more time for his successor.","Nathaniel Long (73%): Out of all the invitees<br />to the Masters Tournament, 46 out of the 92<br />are American, making up exactly half of the<br />invitees, and the biggest percentage of a single<br />nationality in the tournament. The current #1<br />ranked player and defending champion is American<br />Scottie Scheffler, followed by Rory McIlroy of<br />Northern Ireland and Ludvig Aberg from Sweden.<br />While the other top players are of non-American<br />nationalities, the volume of American invitees and<br />odds on Scheffler imply a substantial likelihood<br />that an American will win the Masters Tournament.","Nathaniel Long (80%): During Donald Trump's first<br />presidency, his overall spending deficit exceeded<br />8 trillion dollars, 5 trillion excluding COVID<br />relief and the CARES act. When compared to Biden's<br />4.3 trillion, it is highly likely that Trump's<br />current presidency will cause an increase in the<br />budget deficit. Considering the current deficit is<br />around 800 billion, it is very likely that Trump<br />will push the deficit boundary past 1 trillion,<br />and likely even further.","Niomi Nurse (10%): It is unlikely that Clarence<br />Thomas will announce his retirement from the<br />Supreme Court before April 28th. There is no real<br />evidence that Clarence Thomas plans to retire from<br />the Supreme court, and it has been proven to be<br />an internet rumor.Thomas nor the Supreme court<br />have never officially announced that he would be<br />retiring.","Niomi Nurse (20%): It is likely that Trump will<br />sign a legislative bill that decreases the federal<br />budget deficit by less than $1 trillion because<br />he has passed similar legislation in the past<br />during his first presidency. During his first<br />term, President Trump approved $8.8 trillion of<br />gross new borrowing and $443 billion of deficit<br />reduction during his full presidential term.<br />During President Biden's term, he approved a<br />$1.9 trillion deficit reduction, which is a stark<br />contrast to that of President Trump's.","Pablo Martinez (20%): There have been many rumors<br />that Clarence Thomas would resign or retire if<br />trump were to be elected in office. Many recent<br />actions of abuse of power as well has put pressure<br />on him to retire/ relieve his position. However it<br />seems there is no defenititve proof that he will<br />retire even before the April 28th deadline. For<br />years this has been topic of conversation and it<br />seems he still shows no interest in resigning at<br />the moment","Pablo Martinez (75%): It seems that the top<br />contenders for this years masters tournament are<br />all American. The top contender at the moment<br />is defending champion Scottie Scheffler. With<br />a +470 to win the tournament, he is the most<br />likely candidate to win. However if it wasent<br />him, it would be runner up Collin Morikawa. He’s<br />also an American player with a 3rd place finish<br />at least years masters. Bryson Dechambeau is<br />also a consistent player as well. With all these<br />Americans showing high potential, it seems that a<br />winner outside the American region would come as<br />an upset/surprise to the golfing world","Pablo Martinez (75%): One of the administration’s<br />primary objectives is to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts<br />and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is set to expire at<br />the end of 2025. Extending these tax cuts could<br />add approximately $7.5 trillion to the national<br />debt over the next decade. While President Trump<br />has advocated for significant budget cuts to<br />offset increased spending, analyses suggest that<br />achieving the proposed deficit reductions without<br />impacting essential programs like Medicare and<br />Medicaid may be challenging. Given the Republican<br />majority in both chambers of Congress, there is a<br />strong likelihood that the proposed tax cuts and<br />spending increases will be enacted, leading to a<br />higher federal budget deficit within the first 100<br />days of the administration.","Quintin Gallardo (20%): In regards to Thomas‘s<br />retirement, there is little evidence suggesting<br />such, but now would be a good time with President<br />Trump in office, allowing for the Republican to<br />be replaced by another of this party. This would<br />allow for the continuation of a Supreme Court<br />where Republicans still have the super majority of<br />6 to 3 allowing for a buffer in case of unexpected<br />defections from the party stances. With all this<br />being said strategically, there is a chance that<br />he will retire, but I have strong convictions that<br />he will not with no evidence suggesting anything<br />else.","Quintin Gallardo (68%): Currently there is a<br />+450 chance that Scotty wins the tournament as an<br />American, but many of his rivals are approaching<br />on this line. According to poly market, Scotty<br />is also favored by about 6% who his closest rival<br />at 18%, which is it necessarily enough to garner<br />a high probability, but with 50 of the top 100<br />tournament being Americans there’s a fairly good<br />chance that another American takes his place even<br />if he is unable to secure the win. this gives<br />me slightly more faith than none in an American<br />taking it all.","Quintin Gallardo (38%): With President Trump,<br />currently 49 days into office the notion of him<br />increasing the federal budget deficit becomes<br />increasingly harder and harder to predict. On<br />one hand, Trump has advocated against holding<br />a national debt while on the other hand, many<br />of his programs have racked up fees. Though the<br />department of government efficiency, DOGE, has cut<br />a large amount of spending it isn’t nearly enough<br />to equate to what we are spending. Overall, I have<br />invested a low probability in this because what is<br />most important is how it looks and more debt isn’t<br />looking good.","Rebecca Mcadam (65%): The projected winner this<br />year is an American, Scottie Scheffler. He is<br />only up by 17% in prediction markets, but there<br />are no strong markets for the Master's yet. From<br />an outside perspective, about half of the golfers<br />going to the Master's this year are from the<br />United States, so purely based on proportions, the<br />chance that an American golfers wins is very high.","Rebecca Mcadam (30%): Since Trump has been<br />very outspoken in his desire to cut government<br />spending, I think he will curb the passing of<br />any legislation that significantly increases the<br />budget deficit. Several bills have been introduced<br />which favor his tax cuts while also increasing<br />the budget deficit, but I think Trump is more<br />concerned with curbing the deficit instead of the<br />tax cuts while.","Rebecca Mcadam (7%): I think it is very unlikely<br />that Clarence Thomas will announce his retirement<br />any time in the near future unless he experiences<br />a major health crisis, like a heart attack. I<br />have not seen any grounded evidence about his<br />retirement, all of the news about it seems to be<br />speculation. That being said, I think he will step<br />down before the end of Trump's term.","Riley Batz (5%): Since Trump’s election in<br />November, many experts have predicted that Supreme<br />Court Justice Clarence Thomas will announce his<br />retirement during Trump’s four years in office.<br />This would allow for Trump to appoint a new<br />conservative justice in his place, maintaining<br />the current conservative majority without risk<br />that Thomas may leave under a democratic President<br />that would appoint a liberal justice. However,<br />given Clarence Thomas has given no indication of<br />possible retirement, paired with the fact that<br />it seems as though he wants to be apart of a few<br />more major cases, I believe there is only a 5%<br />percent chance that Clarence Thomas announces<br />his retirement prior to April 28. Though I am<br />confident that he will retire during Trump’s term,<br />the chances of it happening by the end of the<br />semester are quite low.","Riley Batz (53%): I believe it is more likely<br />than not that an American will will the Masters<br />Tournament. Based on betting odds, I reached a<br />probability of 53%. Scottie Scheffler is at +400,<br />Xander Schauffele is at +1400, Bryson Decambeau<br />is at +1600, Collin Morikawa is at +1800, and<br />Jordan Spieth is at +2500. The heaviest carrier<br />of winning odds is Scottie Scheffler. He is ranked<br />1st worldwide currently, and he is far ahead<br />of rank #2 (Rory Mcllroy). His average points<br />are 14.37, while Rory's is 8.39. However, I am<br />leaning towards the modest side of yes because the<br />other top 5 contenders are not from the U.S., and<br />anything can happen in golf.","Riley Batz (40%): During his first term, Trump<br />passed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which cut<br />corporate and individual taxes. The CBO estimates<br />that extending these cuts would add $3.3 trillion<br />to the deficit over 10 years. Trump plans to<br />extend this legislation again through, but it is<br />likely this will not happen within the first 100<br />days. First, these cuts expire Dec 31, 2025- so<br />congress does not need to be in a rush to pass<br />anything ASAP. The Senate and House do not seem<br />to be on the same page currently. The House wants<br />to pass one single larger piece of legislation,<br />while House republicans want to break up programs.<br />Though I believe the odds are higher that this<br />congress does eventually pass this congress,<br />I do not think it will happen within the first<br />100 days. Major legislation like this extension,<br />or any increase of spending, will take long to<br />negotiate.","Sarah Joyce (10%): Although Clarence Thomas is the<br />oldest Supreme Court justice currently serving and<br />has served the longest, I find it unlikely that<br />he will announce his retirement prior to April<br />28th. He has shown no indication of wanting to<br />retire, though many conservatives think he should<br />strategically while Trump is president. He remains<br />active on the court and is still younger than past<br />justices when they retired, so I believe he is<br />unlikely to announce any time soon.","Sarah Joyce (70%): I think an American winning the<br />Masters is pretty likely because right now most of<br />the top ranked players are American, and Americans<br />have more often than not won the Masters. Also,<br />the current favorite is Scottie Scheffler, who is<br />an American. However, Rory McIlroy is right behind<br />him in odds, and he is from Northern Ireland.","Senait Pirani (29%): While Thomas faces ethics<br />controversies and is the oldest justice on the<br />Court, he has consistently dismissed speculation<br />about stepping down. With a solid conservative<br />majority in place, Thomas may prefer to remain<br />on the bench, waiting for a more politically<br />advantageous moment to step down.","Senait Pirani (70%): An American winning the<br />2025 Masters looks likely, with Scottie Scheffler<br />leading the odds and Xander Schauffele, Bryson<br />DeChambeau, and Jordan Spieth also in contention.<br />However, Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm are strong<br />international threats.","Senait Pirani (20%): Major bills typically require<br />extensive negotiations and time. For instance, the<br />2003 tax cuts and the Medicare Prescription Drug,<br />Improvement, and Modernization Act took months<br />to pass. Additionally, statutory PAYGO rules,<br />reinstated in 2010, mandate that new spending or<br />tax changes do not increase the federal deficit,<br />adding another hurdle.","Sreya Pandyaram (10%): I think that it is<br />unlikely that Justice Clarence Thompson is going<br />to announce his retirement before April 28th. To<br />focus on the outside view ,first, around 40% of<br />Supreme Court justices have retired, and this is<br />due to a various amount of reasons. For example,<br />health concerns, political climate, and pressure.<br />However due to the current sustainable political<br />climate for Clarence Thomas, I don't think<br />retirement is going to happen right away. Newsweek<br />states that Trump may push Thompson to retire<br />since he would want a younger conservative for<br />the new generations. However Newsweek also states<br />that asking Thomson to retire is somewhat \"tricky\"<br />as he may want to surpass Justice Douglas, and in<br />general maximize his political influence. After<br />looking at data, many justices have been persuaded<br />to retire primarily due to aging concerns and<br />public pressure. This is not something that is<br />affecting Thompson intensely right now and has<br />been an ongoing battle.","Sreya Pandyaram (86%): I think that an American<br />will win one of the Masters Tournaments, since<br />research has shown evidence of very strong<br />contenders such as Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz.<br />These players have shown strong performances, and<br />are the best in the world, therefore the potential<br />for a win is high.","Teya Hagy (30%): I think that there is a low<br />probability that clarence thomas will announce his<br />retirement before April 28th. There has been no<br />evidence to support this conclusion and he is not<br />suffering from any illnesses. He may retire during<br />Trumps term, however I do not think that it will<br />be this early.","Teya Hagy (68%): I believe that there is<br />definitely a possibility that Trump will increase<br />the 10 year budget deficiency by more than one<br />trillion dollars. I think that with the tax cuts<br />that he has been imposing. While researching,<br />I found that it is projected for him to spend<br />5.4 Trillion with taxes. I do believe that it is<br />probable for this to happen.","Thomas Smith (10%): To retire this early into a<br />president's term is pretty unlikely to happen.<br />Thomas seems to be in good health as far as the<br />public knows as well. If he is to step down in<br />during Trump's second term it would most likely be<br />towards the end. Thomas himself hasn't expressed<br />interest in stepping down currently and is largely<br />speculated to resign during a later portion of<br />Trump's 2nd term.","Thomas Smith (83%): The great majority of<br />master tournament winners are American. Scottie<br />Scheffler, an American, is also the overwhelming<br />favorite to win and is considered one of the<br />best golf players alive by many sports analysts.<br />Scheffler has won twice before as well.","Thomas Smith (62%): I find it more likely than not<br />that trump will push for increasing the federal<br />budget deficit. Many of trumps cabinet members<br />seem to be preparing the public for temporary<br />hardship and economic uncertainty in wake of<br />tariff negotiations and overhauling the federal<br />work force. To enact many of the administrations<br />potential goals we most likely are going to have<br />to tact on some extra debt.","Tiyanah Rowtham (3%): In my opinion, there is<br />a very low chance that Supreme Court Justice<br />Clarence Thomas will announce his retirement by<br />April 28. I think Clarence Thomas will not retire,<br />but instead die in his position. On the other<br />hand, there is a possibility that Thomas will<br />retire during Trump's presidency to ensure that<br />another Republican successor will replace him.","Tiyanah Rowtham (55%): There is a very good chance<br />that an American will win the master's tournament.<br />Scottie Scheffler is currently ranked No.1 and<br />also won the masters tournament in 2022 and 2024.<br />There are also other strong american golfers like<br />Xander Schauffele and Colin Morikawa who both have<br />a good chance of winning.","Tiyanah Rowtham (35%): The end date for Trump’s<br />100 days is April 29, 2025, leaving 50 more<br />days. Although his policy preferences indicate a<br />willingness to follow measures that increase the<br />deficit, time and congressional constraints may<br />delay or prevent this from happening. Furthermore,<br />no legislation is currently signed nor has the<br />CBO released any policies which will contribute<br />to the $1 trillion threshold. Therefore, I assume<br />that the chances of the budget deficit increasing<br />by more than $1 trillion in the first 100 days<br />is approximately 35%. Evidence suggests that the<br />chances are slim but not impossible to achieve.","Townsend Turner (17%): While I think it is<br />probable that Justice Thomas will retire during<br />this Trump term to insure a continuation of<br />conservative power on the court, I don’t think<br />he will do it before the deadline. That’s about<br />a month and a half and he has another two years<br />realistically to do so. Personally, I also think<br />Thomas wants to be one of if not the longest<br />serving justice in history so there’s that<br />too. However, on the other hand, the worry that<br />Congress’ makeup will change in such a volatile<br />split currently with special elections but then<br />especially midterms could hurry his decision.","Townsend Turner (55%): There is a higher number of<br />American golfers at the top of the golf game than<br />any other nationality. There are six Americans in<br />the top 10 in the world, which gives Americans a<br />better than average likelihood to win the Masters<br />this year. However, personally I am cheering for<br />Rory McIlroy to win it and finally complete his<br />Grand Slam.","Townsend Turner (12%): A number of things would<br />have to happen for this to occur. First, the<br />deficit would need to increase by about $140<br />billion. This would have to occur in the first<br />100 days as well, which puts a time pressure on<br />things. While in 2016, Trump did raise the deficit<br />by almost exactly that number, that was over the<br />course of a whole year. However, with government<br />shutdown looming, inefficient budgeting is<br />certainly a possibility at least.","Tristan Thompson (36%): I do not think that it<br />is likely that Clarence Thomas will announce<br />retirement from the supreme court within the<br />allotted time frame. While there was some buzz<br />and speculation about it last year, very little<br />has been said about it since, and I think it is<br />more of a possibility that he does not announce<br />retirement before April 28th.","Tristan Thompson (57%): Predicting the outcome<br />of a golf tournament is one of, if not the most<br />difficult sports prediction in existence. There<br />are so many factors that can play into a round<br />of golf, and with the skill gap for professionals<br />being razor thin the higher up the rankings you<br />go, the outcome could occur based on a few lucky<br />breaks for any specific golfer. That being said,<br />I give a slight edge to an American winning the<br />Masters. The United States has a large proportion<br />of players in The Masters, and Scottie Scheffler ><br />Rory McIlroy.","Tristan Thompson (42%): Neither Biden nor Trump<br />were able to pass legislation on the budget<br />deficit at all, let alone over a trillion dollars<br />within the first 100 days of their terms. The<br />closest in recent history over the threshold of<br />1 trillion occurred with Trump’s “Tax Cuts and<br />Jobs Act,” which was approved by congress in<br />December of Trump’s first year. Adding to the<br />budget deficit is an act that comes with lots of<br />controversy, and the first 100 days are a popular<br />measure of presidential success, so it is crucial<br />for approval ratings to be high at this time.","Vangeli Tsiaras (1%): I think it is extremely<br />unlikely that Clarence Thomas will announce his<br />retirement from SCOTUS before April 28th for<br />various reasons. The Supreme Court has played<br />a more assertive and watched role in the past<br />few years as they have done things such as<br />overturning Roe v. Wade and decisions regarding<br />Presidential immunity, with all of them having<br />Clarence Thomas with a commanding viewpoint<br />regarding the decisions. With major developments<br />both domestically and internationally such as<br />immigration, the Wars in Ukraine and Israel,<br />environmental concerns, etc.. I find it highly<br />improbable that Thomas will retire so quickly<br />as someone who loves his job, with America being<br />in such an interesting political and social<br />environment","Vangeli Tsiaras (90%): Even though my knowledge<br />of golf is minimal, I think there is a great<br />chance that an American will win the Masters.<br />Scottie Scheffler, the number one golf player<br />in the world, won the tournament in 2022 and<br />2024 will be competing again this year, along<br />with other talented American golfers such as<br />Xander Schauffele and Will Zalatoris. Given that<br />Scheffler will be competing with mostly other<br />Americans and has won the tournament twice, most<br />recently winning in 2024, there is a great chance<br />that he will win a third time or another American<br />will take his spot.","Wyatt Dasher (0%): I took a class last semester<br />where we learned the psychology and history of<br />each justice.if he retires I believe he is going<br />to want to break the record for longest standing<br />judge. I feel extremely confident that he wants to<br />break the records. He himself is a constitutional<br />purist and conservative .","Wyatt Dasher (70%): In my briefing I went into<br />detail about why an American will most likely<br />win and why that American is most likely scottie<br />scheffler. This is because of historical context,<br />betting odds, and because of the tradition of<br />Rory not winning the masters. This is also because<br />about 60% of the players are American in the<br />tournament. This helps account for chaos theory<br />because even if a player who is not in the top ten<br />wins (which is unlikely) it is most likely going<br />to be an American.","Wyatt Dasher (60%): Trump has expressed wanting to<br />make policy that would increase it. The question<br />is will it happen within the time line. My other<br />predictions that seem to say that trumps can’t do<br />it in a timely manner seem to be working against<br />me. So I am predicting trump will do it.","Wyatt Stevenson (10%): Clarence Thomas yet has<br />shown any sign of retiring from the Supreme<br />Court. Some may suggest that he retire; however,<br />President Trump has shown that he supports Justice<br />Thomas. Justice Thomas has been involved and<br />helped with cases involving Trump; like the Trump<br />v. United States case. However, despite Trump's<br />favor of Justice Thomas, Thomas has shown his<br />commitment to the Supreme Court and dedication to<br />the law and I think he will continue to serve in<br />this country's Supreme Court.","Wyatt Stevenson (70%): The masters tournament<br />taking place in Augusta usually has more American<br />representation in the tournament than any<br />other country. With Scottie Scheffler, Xander<br />Schauffele, and many others, I think it is very<br />likely that an American will win the masters.<br />However, players like Rory Mcllroy from Ireland<br />who has won all the majors except the masters<br />is due to take home the green jacket. It will be<br />interesting who ends up bringing home the green<br />jacket, but I do believe an American will win.","Wyatt Stevenson (55%): Trump has stated that<br />he wants to balance the federal budget and he<br />wants to decrease government spending in general.<br />Tariffs in the short term and tax cuts could<br />increase the budget deficit in the short term.<br />The tax cuts could increase corporate income<br />that allow people to hire, invest, and pay more.<br />However, that leads to the government having<br />less opportunity to spend, which may cause them<br />to make adjustments to their spending. Tariffs<br />may have the same affect, but Trump wants to<br />protect domestic industries, which may lower the<br />opportunity for government spending.","James Martin (30%): I think there is a 30%<br />probability that Clarence Thomas announces his<br />retirement from the Supreme Court before April 28.<br />Although there has been no official talk about it,<br />there has been a bunch of speculation. He is one<br />of the most conservative justices in the court.<br />If he were to retire it could effect gun rights,<br />affirmative action, and regulatory power. There is<br />no reliable information about his retirement but<br />based on the speculation, there is a possibility.","James Martin (60%): I think there is a 60%<br />probability that an American will win the Masters<br />Tournament. There are several factors to consider<br />when making this decision. There are very talented<br />players both American and International. I<br />believe an American is going to win because they<br />are already more favored to do well. They have<br />experience playing in Augusta, most of the top<br />projected players have Masters experience, and are<br />more equipped to handle changing weather patterns.","Ruby Douglas (5%): I think the probability of<br />Clarence Thomas stepping down is extremely slim<br />considering the fact that it would interfere with<br />the Republican majority and his health doesn’t<br />necessarily show any signs of retiring. He has<br />also repeatedly dismissed speculation about<br />retiring.","Ruby Douglas (70%): Some factors to consider<br />is the fact that a Republican-controlled<br />Congress would likely support tax cuts,<br />whereas a Democratic-controlled Congress would<br />resist deficit-increasing legislation without<br />accompanying spending cuts or revenue increases.<br />If Trump’s primary focus is tax cuts or military<br />spending, those could drive up the deficit<br />quickly. The most recent president’s have<br />increased the deficit during their first couple of<br />months in office but for different reasons. Obama<br />(Great Recession) and Trump (COVID-19) increased<br />deficits rapidly due to emergency economic<br />stimulus and relief efforts. While Biden’s<br />American Rescue Plan Act increased the deficit<br />significantly but was framed as necessary for<br />post-pandemic recovery. Given the administration’s<br />current fiscal strategies and objectives, it is<br />likely that President Trump will sign legislation<br />resulting in a federal budget deficit increase<br />exceeding $1 trillion.","Teya Hagy (75%): I believe that there is a high<br />possibility that an American will win The Masters.<br />There are 5 people in the top ten predictions<br />and the number one predicted winner is also an<br />American. I think that 75 is a fair number because<br />of the odds being high for an American to win."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will

Ossoff's<br />own campaign for the 2021 special election was<br />launched in January of that year. All told,<br />I could only find a few examples of Senate<br />candidates making their announcements so soon,<br />for example, Fetterman in February 2021. But,<br />critically, none of the early-announcers I found<br />were also *sitting governors* in the middle of a<br />legislative session. I'm not saying that Governor<br />Kemp won't run for Senate (more on that in the<br />next question), but I would be pretty surprised<br />if he chose the next month to do so. He has other<br />things on his plate at the moment, and prudence<br />dictates that he wait and see what the political<br />climate looks like in late 2025 before throwing<br />his hat in the ring.","Joe Ornstein (66%): If Harris had won in November,<br />we wouldn't be asking this question. Governor Kemp<br />wouldn't be running for Senate--he'd be running<br />for President, and I would have put pretty good<br />odds on him winning in 2028. In this timeline,<br />however, that plan is out the window. If the Trump<br />administration is broadly popular over the next<br />four years, Republicans will nominate someone<br />like Vance. If the Trump administration is broadly<br />unpopular...well, you're not going to see a lot of<br />Republicans clamoring for the nomination. Although<br />midterm elections are typically unfavorable to the<br />president's party, Kemp has far and away the best<br />chance of any Republican to win the seat. For the<br />good of the party--and for a nice place to land<br />until 2032--I think he will probably run.","Joe Ornstein (25%): It's been slightly over two<br />years since OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023<br />(which was roughly two and a half years after<br />they released GPT-3 in June 2020). The general<br />formula that the company has followed since its<br />inception is to release a new GPT every few years<br />that dramatically increases the scale and cost<br />of the previous model, and up until now that<br />strategy has yielded consistent improvements<br />in model performance. But, by Sam Altman's own<br />admission, they seem to have reached the limits<br />of this strategy, and pure scaling is not going<br />to make GPT-5 dramatically better than GPT-4.<br />The model dubbed GPT-4.5 that was released<br />at the end of February is *probably* what was<br />originally intended to be GPT-5---the model that,<br />per the hype, was supposed to usher in AGI. It<br />didn't, and the new model dubbed GPT-5 is going<br />to lean more heavily on bells-and-whistles like<br />chain-of-thought reasoning and routing queries to<br />other models. I doubt that the company will want<br />to release it until they have a large number of<br />impressive demos to show off.","Joe Ornstein (75%): When a PM calls a snap<br />election, it's generally a sign that they think<br />their party has a good shot of retaining or<br />expanding their parliamentary majority. But<br />looking at this historically, I was pretty<br />surprised to see how often politicians completely<br />whiffed on these gambles. In a sample of post-war<br />Western parliamentary elections, the party that<br />called the snap election won the most seats only<br />about 70% of the time. (My favorite snap election<br />story is New Zealand 1984, when PM Robert Muldoon<br />announced the election live on television while<br />visibly drunk, and was subsequently crushed by<br />the Labour Party.) In Canada, the party calling<br />snap elections has succeeded 5 out of 6 times<br />since 1958. There's reason to be somewhat more<br />optimistic than the base rate here; the Liberal<br />Party's polling has shot up since January 20,<br />with a further boost after Trudeau was replaced by<br />Carney as party leader. Polling averages have been<br />quite accurate in Canada over the past 25 years,<br />and the Liberals currently lead by a comfortable<br />but not insurmountable

The time frame is too soon to be able<br />to possibly tell whether a new product/version is<br />being released. With that being said, there have<br />been no reports on a release date for the product<br />GPT-5. While I do think that it might be created,<br />I find it extremely unlikely that it’ll be done by<br />April 28th.","Aaliyah Diaz (62%): It’s very difficult to say but<br />I do find it unlikely that the Liberal Party will<br />win the most seats in Parliament in Canada's snap<br />election. As of right now the Conservative Party<br />has been strong competitors and continue to be.<br />With Trudeau’s recent decline in approval ratings<br />and other aspects that may hurt the Liberal Party<br />only being a small example as to why I feel this<br />way.","Addisen Kameron (15%): By comparing Kemp to<br />current Senators who served as governors, and<br />looking at his chaotic schedule regarding the<br />current legislative session and his position as<br />the Chair of the RGA, I think his announcement<br />will fall after the April 28th deadline. If<br />my math is correct, 12 of the current senators<br />used to be governors. Out of the 12, 8 were not<br />governors when they announced their campaign for<br />the senate. 1 of the 12 was appointed and the<br />other 3 announced their campaigns during the later<br />part of their governorship, with only Jim Justice<br />meeting the given deadline.","Addisen Kameron (87%): I think there’s a strong<br />likelihood that Kemp will run for Senate in 2026.<br />From what I’ve seen, the Georgia GOP is very<br />supportive of Kemp running against Ossoff and I<br />doubt he’ll pass it up. Some have spoken about<br />him running for President but if he really wanted<br />to he could just resign his Senate position later<br />on. I think he’s the most likely candidate for the<br />Republican nomination.","Addisen Kameron (30%): I think it will be released<br />this year but probably not before April 28th.<br />Open AI’s GPT 4 was released March 13 of last<br />year and it took them almost a year to release<br />4.5 (February 27) and it’s still only available to<br />pro/plus users. Altman said on twitter in February<br />that GPT-5 would take months which I know is not<br />a very traditional news source but he does post on<br />there a lot so it seems relevant.","Addisen Kameron (58%): I’m very hesitant about<br />this one. The polls for the liberals have been<br />looking pretty good since Trudeau left, but<br />they’re still barely above the conservatives. I<br />saw a poll saying 50% of those who said they’d<br />vote liberal are not solidified in that vote<br />which makes me increasingly hesitant. But the<br />Conservative Party is also removing media that<br />follows them around on the campaign which to me<br />screams weakness and fear but it might just be<br />about saving money. Honestly, I have no idea.","Andreas Papandreou (33%): Governor Kemp has stated<br />that he is currently very busy and has refused<br />to comment on question pertaining to a potential<br />senate bid in 2026. The Georgia legislative<br />session ends at the beginning of April and he will<br />continue his work as the leader of the Republican<br />Governor Association. Due to his high favorability<br />in the state, Kemp has no incentive to declare<br />for the senate race early. Additionally, a run for<br />the senate may post-pone a potential presidential<br />bid in 2028. Therefore, I find it unlikely that<br />Governor Kemp will announce a run for the US<br />senate by the end of April.","Andreas Papandreou (45%): I think that Governor<br />Kemp's main goal is to become president of the<br />US. In this I find that he is likely waiting to<br />see Americans opinion of the G.O.P controlled<br />federal government. If the country favors the<br />actions of the federal government I predict<br />that Governor Kemp will likely look to run for<br />president in 2028, but if the country is against<br />the GOP, I find it much likelier that Kemp runs<br />for the senate, to a position that he has a large<br />likelihood of winning, and postpone a run for<br />president to 2032.","Andreas Papandreou (0%): The current reports of<br />GPT-5, including the words of CEO Sam Altman,<br />suggests that the product is in the works but<br />will not be released by April 28th. The general<br />consensus is that GPT-5 is eying to be released as<br />early as summer 2025. I could not find reporting<br />that suggests a release of the product in April.<br />Therefore, I cannot find any reason to believe<br />that GPT-5 will be released by our set deadline.","Andreas Papandreou (80%): Since the resignation<br />of Trudeau and the escalating trade war started<br />by the Trump administration, the Liberal Party<br />has had an emergence in the polls. In the 16 polls<br />since the election of Mark Carney as the leader of<br />the Liberal Party, the conservatives have only led<br />in 3 polls. This signifies to me that the Liberal<br />Party will win the most seats in parlaiment.","Andy Wyatt (27%): Governor Kemp will almost<br />certainly not announce a run for Senate before<br />the end of the legislative session, April 4.<br />This is a Georgia tradition, and he said publicly<br />he would not break it. It’s an open question<br />whether he will run at all, though. His allies<br />are skeptical that he will, and other Republicans<br />are openly saying they would consider running if<br />Kemp stood down. But, if Kemp is interested, will<br />he announce before April 28? That’s also a tough<br />call. Herschel Walker didn’t announce until August<br />2021 that he would run for the 2022 Senate race,<br />but Kemp announced on March 31, 2017, that he was<br />running for the 2018 Governor race. And candidates<br />across both parties are lining up for statewide<br />runs currently.","Andy Wyatt (5%): Taking the outside view, OpenAI<br />has a base rate of releasing major models every<br />2-3 years. GPT-4 was released in March 2023, so<br />late 2025 would fall into the pattern for the<br />release of GPT-5. OpenAI released GPT-4.5 (Orion)<br />on February 27, and Sam Altman said GPT-5 will be<br />released “in months, not weeks.” Industry experts<br />agree and are predicting a release in December<br />2025. Moreover, OpenAI has encountered challenges<br />with logistics, such as hardware upgrades, data<br />limitations, and resource allocation.","Andy Wyatt (89%): Current poll trackers and<br />projections (courtesy of CBC News and 388<br />Canada) give the Liberal’s good odds of capturing<br />more seats than any other party in Parliament.<br />Averaging the two aforementioned models equals<br />around 84% odds for the Liberals capturing the<br />most seats. I boost this probability slightly<br />given the current surge in polls for the party,<br />which has changed nearly overnight.","Angela Jacobs (33%): Governor Brian Kemp has<br />not announced a U.S. Senate run and is currently<br />focused on Georgia’s legislative session (which<br />ends April 4) and his role with the Republican<br />Governors Association. Even though it is possible<br />Kemp announces plans after that date, his current<br />focus on his commitments makes it unlikely it will<br />happen in this timeline. He has acknowledged the<br />decision but hasn’t set a timeline. Given these<br />factors, the likelihood of him announcing before<br />April 28 is around 33%.","Angela Jacobs (11%): ChatGPT 4.5 was recently<br />released, though OpenAI hasn't officially released<br />it for use. Given that, the chances of a full GPT<br />5 release before April 28 are still quite low.<br />OpenAI tends to space out major model versions,<br />and there hasn't been any official announcement or<br />strong rumors about GPT 5 launching that soon.","Angela Jacobs (66%): The Liberals currently lead<br />in national polling (roughly 42% vs. 35% for the<br />Conservatives), and recent events, like U.S. trade<br />tensions, have boosted their support. Canada’s<br />first-past-the-post system means seat distribution<br />matters more than raw vote share. The Liberals are<br />favored, but campaign controversies could arise<br />along with debates and voter turnout that could<br />still shift the race.","Anna Rachwalski (15%): If he were to run,<br />an announcement before April 28, 2025, seems<br />premature. Most candidates for a 2026 Senate<br />race would announce later in 2025 or early<br />2026. Furthermore, he’s constantly stated<br />that he’s focused on his gubernatorial duties,<br />and I personally think his ambitions are more<br />presidential than senatorial.","Anna Rachwalski (15%): While I don’t think it’s<br />entirely unlikely, I think there is a slim chance<br />that it gets released in the first part of the<br />year, as OpenAI has just released their 4.5 model.<br />OpenAI doesn’t often release a lot of new products<br />in a row, and with the release of a .5 version,<br />I’d expect that if we see GPT-5 this year, it will<br />be in November or December. While my prediction<br />doesn’t agree with Polymarket, which says there’s<br />a 63% chance that it will be released by June 30,<br />2025, I believe that Polymarket may be skewed in<br />favor of more AI development, due to the probably<br />very pro-AI demographic using the website.","Anna Rachwalski (75%): CBCNews's PollTracker<br />has the liberals likely winning the election,<br />and 338 Canada agrees. Based on Mark Carney's<br />current popularity and the current unpopularity<br />of conservative policies in America, I'd expect<br />Canadians to go Liberal, hoping that Carney<br />continues to stand up against the threat of Canada<br />becoming the 51st state.","Archita Gaur (42%): It is very likely that<br />Kemp will announce a run for the US Senate for<br />next year. However, I have doubt that he will<br />announce before April 28th. When looking at the<br />data, politicians usually announce about 12-18<br />months before the election. This means between<br />May and November 2025. Early announcements are<br />for high-profile races or challenges trying to<br />build up name recognition. Kemp has mentioned<br />that there is a lot on his plate with the current<br />legislative session. On Feb 8, Kemp said \"we<br />made a commitment during this last campaign cycle<br />[...] that we would deliver on the things that<br />we were promising. And that’s what I’m focused on<br />doing the next two and a half months during the<br />legislative session.” The legislative session ends<br />on April 4th so he might announce between the 5th<br />and the 28th, which raises the probability. If the<br />national GOP wants Kemp to lock in his candidacy<br />early, he may decide to announce sooner. However,<br />if he continues prioritizing state politics beyond<br />April 4, his Senate announcement could be delayed<br />further. Since there is no urgency, Kemp may<br />choose a later date, following the typical 12-18<br />month timeline. After weighing these factors,<br />the final estimate for an announcement before<br />April 28 is 42%. This means that while an April<br />announcement is possible—particularly after the<br />legislative session ends—it remains more likely<br />that he will wait until later in the year.","Archita Gaur (78%): Based on his recent comments<br />and political positioning, it is highly likely<br />that Brian Kemp will run for the U.S. Senate in<br />2026. His statements about the need to flip the<br />seat, his strong standing within the GOP, and his<br />national fundraising efforts suggest he is laying<br />the groundwork for a campaign. While he has not<br />officially announced, all signs point to a Senate<br />run. The only reason I do not see him running is<br />if his political goals end here or if he believes<br />there is another equally strong candidate (there<br />isn't).","Archita Gaur (27%): OpenAI Ceo Sam Altman recently<br />claimed that GPT 5 will be released sometime<br />soon. GPT 4.5 was available on February 27th for<br />pro users. Sources have said that Microsoft is<br />expecting GPT 5 to be released in late May, after<br />April 28th, which aligns with Altman’s promise<br />of the next-gen model arriving within a matter<br />of months. However, a closer look at OpenAI's<br />history reveals that this date could definitely<br />be pushed back. OpenAI was originally planning to<br />release GPT-4.5 by the end of 2024, but this was<br />delayed to early 2025. Talks about GPT-5 started<br />in September 2023 and some question if OpenAI is<br />struggling to build a new frontier model as it<br />has been so long. The reason I put this a little<br />higher at 27% is because other AI models, like<br />DeepSeek, pose a serious level of competition and<br />OpenAI will want to stay on top of developments.<br />This could indicate that they release the model<br />earlier.","Archita Gaur (78%): The Liberal Party currently<br />holds a favorable position to win the most seats<br />in the upcoming snap election. The Liberals have<br />risen to 42% support (a 4-point increase), while<br />the Conservatives remain steady at 36%, and the<br />New Democratic Party (NDP) has declined to 10%<br />(a 2-point decrease). Something that absolutely<br />must be mentioned is the relations between The US<br />and Canada. President Trump's aggressive stance<br />toward Canada, including threats of annexation<br />and punitive tariffs, has sparked a wave of<br />nationalism among Canadians. This sentiment<br />appears to be benefiting the Liberals, who are<br />perceived as better suited to defend national<br />interests.","Ava Herring (35%): I say that the percentage is<br />a little less than 50 because he has acknowledged<br />running, meaning that he has thought about it<br />somewhat. However, the election is not until next<br />year, so the chances of him announcing something<br />are pretty low due to how early it is. Kemp has<br />other responsibilities that could cause him to<br />delay this announcement.","Ava Herring (15%): I believe that the chances<br />of this happening are pretty low. The CEO stated<br />that GPT-5 is coming within a couple of months,<br />which most likely means mid-2025 rather than early<br />2025. We are also still waiting for the release of<br />GPT-4.5 to officially launch to the public, which<br />is supposed to launch before GPT-5. If GPT-4.5<br />launches within the next couple of months, the<br />GPT-5 is most likely going to be later in the<br />year.","Ava Herring (74%): I say that there is a pretty<br />high chance that the Liberal Party will win the<br />most seats in Canada. This is because based on<br />the recent national polls, Liberals are currently<br />beating the Conservatives. Forecasting models also<br />show that there will be more Liberal seats than<br />conservative seats. I also believe that Trump's<br />recent election win is also causing more liberal<br />support due to the current political climate.","Ayaan Fazal (35%): Given that Kemp has not<br />announced his run for Senate, it is somewhat<br />unlikely that he will run for U.S. Senate. In a<br />recent interview, Kemp did not directly address<br />his run for Senate, but was not completely partial<br />to the decision. While he has not given any<br />concrete answer, it is difficult to say whether he<br />will, but I doubt he will.","Ayaan Fazal (70%): Given that Kemp has a stronger<br />chance to outperform Ossoff in the polls, I<br />believe there is a strong chance Kemp would run<br />in 2026. Considering Kemp's political trajectory,<br />his strong polling numbers against the incumbent,<br />and the strategic significance of the Senate seat<br />for the Republican Party, there is a substantial<br />likelihood that he will decide to run.","Ayaan Fazal (3%): I firmly believe that there will<br />not be a new updated model of GPT available before<br />April 28th. This is primarily because CEO of<br />Chat-GPT, Sam Altman, announced that the new model<br />will come \"a few months\" after the new model of<br />4.5. The latest model was released February 27th,<br />which is fairly early.","Ayaan Fazal (75%): Given that Canada's Liberal<br />Party Leader, Prime Minister Mark Carney, has<br />gained a lead over the Conservative Party. An<br />Ipsos poll shows the Liberals at 42% and the<br />Conservatives at 36% among decided voters. Given<br />these trends, it is highly probable that Liberal<br />Party will secure the most seats in the upcoming<br />election.","Bailey Mattox (15%): I think there is a pretty<br />high likelihood that Kemp will run for Senate,<br />but I don't think the likelihood is nearly as high<br />before April 28th. The legislative session doesn't<br />even end until May 4th and in general, most<br />candidates don't even announce their run until<br />the summer or fall anyways especially in more<br />contested races.","Bailey Mattox (78%): I think there is a high<br />likelihood that Kemp will run for Senate. I even<br />think this may be a stepping stone for him to<br />potentially run for president at some point. Being<br />a Senator would be a good way to get national name<br />ID for a potential presidential candidacy.","Bailey Mattox (10%): Seeing as Chat GPT 4.5 just<br />came out, I think it's unlikely that we will see<br />Chat GPT 5 within the next month and a half. Sam<br />Altman said that it would be released \"within<br />months\" after 4.5 was released. In my opinion that<br />likely means about 2-6 months after 4.5 and April<br />28th would be just a tad too early to expect Chat<br />Gpt 5","Bailey Mattox (84%): The liberal party is growing<br />their lead over the conservatives under the new<br />Prime Minister, Mark Carney. CBS is putting the<br />odds of the liberals winning the most seats at<br />75%. I think Carney will be even more popular<br />closer to the election especially considering<br />his stance on the tariffs which I think will be a<br />major motivating factor in Canada's election.","Benjamin Jacobstein (45%): There is a significant<br />chance that Brian Kemp will announce his candidacy<br />for senate by the date April 28, but it is not<br />guaranteed. The timing of his decision will<br />ultimately depend on the calculus of balancing<br />his political decisions with personal decisions<br />post April 4 when Georgia's legislative session<br />adjourns. He has said “I’m in the middle of<br />my legislative session… I made a commitment on<br />[chairing the RGA]\", which makes me think that<br />before April 4 is a definite no go for him. Many<br />analysts currently believe Kemp is leaning toward<br />running, but considering the short window between<br />the end of the legislative session and April<br />28, I think it is unlikely to happen before the<br />deadline.","Benjamin Jacobstein (100%): I believe that Kemp<br />will announce his candidacy for Senate at some<br />point, but he will not do it by April 28. He<br />might have some questionable ties with Russia,<br />given that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, he<br />was the only governor who did not allow for the<br />investigation of Russian election interference<br />at the voting machines. But objectively, he has<br />done a lot Georgia and Georgians. He has cut<br />income taxes multiple times, making Georgia one<br />of the most tax-friendly states in the country.<br />He expanded the state’s investment in technical<br />colleges and workforce development programs<br />to support industries like manufacturing and<br />cybersecurity. His administration played a key<br />role in securing major economic deals, such as<br />the Rivian and Hyundai EV plants, which brought<br />billions in investments and thousands of new jobs.<br />Additionally, he increased funding for public<br />safety, boosted teacher pay, and expanded rural<br />broadband access to underserved communities. On<br />paper, he is a governor that represents Georgians,<br />and the fact that he is not on the Trump train but<br />still puts his endorsement behind him to support<br />party unity makes him popular among Republicans<br />and people who are on the fence. He’s the dream<br />candidate for the Republican Party, and I do think<br />he will run for senate.","Benjamin Jacobstein (18%): It seems highly<br />unlikely that OpenAI will release GPT5 before<br />April 28. Sam Altman, the ceo of open ai recently<br />has been tweeting updating us on the capabilities<br />of GPT4.5 (the released and last iteration of<br />GPT 4) and GPT5 as well as some ideas of their<br />capabilities. He has responded to people’s threads<br />asking how long it’ll take till it is released and<br />he replies that it is “months” away. Given that<br />4.5 is very new and he says that 5 is months away,<br />I think it is more realistic to see a release<br />later this year not before April 28.","Benjamin Jacobstein (69%): A recent ipsos poll<br />puts the Liberal Party at 42% which is an increase<br />from prior month. This means that the Liberal<br />Party will likely have a majority. Donald Trump<br />and his current actions towards Canada have cause<br />a rise in Canadian nationalism and is likely a<br />big factor in the rise in support according to<br />the Associate Press. Polls are not always accurate<br />however, and a lot can change between now and<br />elections.","Bennie Trujillano (18%): I don't doubt that<br />there's pressure on Kemp to run against Ossof for<br />his seat in the senate. However, that election<br />feels way too far away and senate bids aren't<br />typically announced so early. I'd expect Kemp to<br />announce in maybe a year from now, if he chooses<br />to run at all.","Bennie Trujillano (66%): Kemp is pretty well known<br />in Georgia and Republicans will absolutely turn<br />out for him. A win against Ossoff is very possible<br />and the GOP would love more seats. However,<br />I'm very unsure as to whether he'll run or not<br />considering Trump and Kemp's previous disputes.","Bennie Trujillano (15%): Considering Altman’s<br />recent tweets regarding the release of GPT-5<br />requiring additional months to finish and the<br />typical release schedule of their products, GPT-5<br />is on the way. However, any release by April 28th<br />feels very unlikely. I’m sure that OpenAI wants to<br />release as soon as possible to combat competitors<br />like Deepseek, but they are also required to<br />complete more extensive testing than previous<br />models. A summer launch feels far more likely.","Bennie Trujillano (60%): The liberal party<br />currently has a pretty substantial number of seats<br />compared to the other parties in the Canadian<br />house of common but its still pretty close.<br />Currently, I assume a lot of Canadians have<br />distaste for Trump and they would want a liberal<br />house, but Trump also tends to bring out more<br />conservative tendencies globally. I feel like this<br />could reasonably go either way.","Brooke Cheney (68%): I believe that if Governor<br />Kemp was not planning on running, he would have<br />publicly stated that by now. He mentions in an<br />interview with Fox5 Atlanta that he has a lot on<br />his plate with the legislature being in session.<br />Given it ends on April 4, I believe he will make<br />the announcement shortly after. It sounds like<br />he wants to finish up his current duties before<br />announcing. Given Kemp's role in chairing the<br />Republican Governor's Association and being active<br />in growing the GOP donor base, it is clear his<br />passion for policy extends beyond his current role<br />as Governor. Beyond Senate, his next option would<br />be a presidential run.","Brooke Cheney (70%): Given Kemp's role in chairing<br />the Republican Governor's Association and being<br />active in growing the GOP donor base, it is clear<br />his passion for policy extends beyond his current<br />role as Governor. Given that he is a front runner<br />candidate and fairly popular among Georgians, he<br />would be the most capable of defeating Ossoff,<br />which he knows.","Brooke Cheney (25%): The CEO of ChatGPT indicated<br />in February that ChatGPT5 was expected to be<br />released in months, so it is definitely hard to<br />say what exactly that means. Given that there<br />is usually a press release days or weeks before<br />something is released, it makes it less likely it<br />will be released before April 28th. Some sources<br />claim safety testing is probably the largest<br />factor in its delay, which I believe to be true.<br />However, Open AI released ChatGPT 4.5 on February<br />27th, 2025, so it shows promise 5 should be next.<br />They also might be tempted to release given the<br />encroaching competition.","Brooke Cheney (37%): Justin Trudeau, a member<br />of the Liberal Party, stepped down last month in<br />response to his popularity plummeting over the<br />past twelve months. Mark Carney replaced him,<br />and there has been a recent surge in Canadian<br />nationalism and liberal values amidst the US’s<br />trade war with the country. Now current polling<br />data suggests liberals are slightly ahead of<br />conservatives, which is why it is no coincidence<br />Carney has called a snap election now because<br />they have the best chance of winning. However, no<br />political party has nominated candidates to 343<br />ridings, but the liberal party is particularly<br />lacking with only 185 nominated. My friends<br />from Canada suggested that liberals are not very<br />good at voter turnout and will win seats less<br />than predicted. This will be a very close race<br />regardless, but I do believe that conservatives<br />will win the most seats.","Chinelo Ireh (35%): I am doubtful that Governor<br />Kemp will announce any news about a Senate<br />campaign before April 28. Bills that get past both<br />chambers of the Georgia General Assembly have a<br />40 day waiting period on the Governor’s desk. The<br />end of session is April 4 so would be later than<br />April 28. It would be strategic to wait until<br />the more pertinent bills of the year such as tort<br />reform get passed so that he can have something to<br />brag about in his announcement. I also think that<br />announcing a Senate race now would be too early.","Chinelo Ireh (75%): There is much talk around the<br />Capitol that Governor Kemp has the progressive<br />ambition to run for US Senate in the next<br />election. Kemp has been selected as the Chair of<br />the Republican Governors Association and has been<br />able to garner support across Georgians of all<br />political ideologies with his economic policy that<br />has helped develop the state. The term is only<br />a year long and it is a solid stepping stone to<br />announcing a Senate campaign. He would also have<br />the support of national Republicans to increase<br />the majority in the Senate.","Chinelo Ireh (15%): I highly doubt that OpenAI<br />will release GPT-5 before April 18 because GPT-4.5<br />was only released on February 27, 2025. GPT-4o<br />was released on May 13, 2024, only ten months ago.<br />Simply assessing the wait time between products<br />that OpenAI has released has shown a pattern of<br />releases taking at least six months to over a<br />year. GPT-4.5 was also not received as well as<br />GPT-4o, with critics saying that it did not live<br />up to the same hype as GPT-4o. This leads me to<br />believe that OpenAI will take longer to release<br />the next product.","Chinelo Ireh (60%): Given the recent switch in<br />polling, I think Carney’s Liberal party has a<br />slight advantage in Canada’s snap election. The<br />frontrunner of the Conservative Party, Pierre<br />Poilievre, is now facing accusations of being<br />too ideologically similar to Trump. Canadian<br />voters who were once mostly concerned with<br />inflation and immigration are now concerned with<br />existential threats from Trump. I think there is<br />a rally-round-the-flag effect for the Liberals<br />now because Trudeau and Carney have been the major<br />voices in opposition of Trump’s threats to annex<br />Canada and promises of strong tariffs.","Chloe Cooper (37%): If Kemp were to run for<br />Senate it seems like he's basically a lock for<br />the seat, so its just a question of whether he<br />wants it or not. There's been lots of buzz around<br />whether or not Kemp will run for it, with most<br />Georgia republicans being strongly in favor of<br />his potential campaign. Kemp has said that he has<br />a lot on his plate currently but that he, \"can't<br />keep holding out forever, so we'll have something<br />to say on that down the road,\" alluding to a<br />possible announcement soon. The timeline for this<br />could be interesting as it seems like the earliest<br />Kemp could announce his run would be in early<br />April, but will he hold off until after? With no<br />rush to declare anything I'm leaning towards no,<br />but I think it might be close.","Chloe Cooper (76%): It seems like Kemps two most<br />likely options coming up are to either run for the<br />senate spot in Georgia, which he is very likely<br />to win, or take a shot at running for president in<br />2028. Trump and Kemp have not always seen eye to<br />eye in many matters, and have a rocky relationship<br />to say the least. If the Trump presidency ends<br />up looking good to the republican voters then<br />Kemp's chances of being a serious candidate for<br />the 2028 election seem slim, with closely aligned<br />Trumpian right wingers such as current VP JD Vance<br />seemingly being a good candidate. If the second<br />Trump era doesn't end up looking good, this could<br />be a good boost for Kemp though, as he is not<br />strictly aligned with the MAGA crowd. With the<br />ever volatile political climate I think Kemp is<br />most likely to take the safe road and grab the<br />senate seat while he still can to maybe boost his<br />chances at a possible presidential run in 2032.","Chloe Cooper (8%): With GPT-4.5 rolling out only<br />about a week ago, and no official announcement<br />about a GPT-5 release date yet, I would say that<br />the release of GPT-5 is pretty unlikely to happen<br />before the end of April. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman<br />said that it would be \"months\" until GPT-5 would<br />be able to be released back in mid February and<br />most people speculate that it's not going to be<br />until late May before any release happens. It<br />seems like this model is looking to be a very<br />big step and require lots of testing before being<br />released, and OpenAI will probably want to really<br />make sure that everything works well before<br />putting it out on the market. Polymarket also<br />has it to release by the end of June at only 49%,<br />meaning people are even doubtful it'll be out by<br />then.","Chloe Cooper (89%): With the Liberal party<br />replacing former Prime Minister Trudeau with new<br />Prime Minister Mark Carney, their numbers in the<br />Canadian opinion polls have skyrocketed over the<br />course of the past few months. Where they were<br />previously behind the conservatives by a large<br />margin, they were able to make that up recently<br />and are now polling ahead of the conservative<br />party. A recent article released on the 18th of<br />March has the liberals a full 6 points ahead of<br />the conservatives at 42% and 36% respectively, and<br />another a political analyst has stated that the<br />liberals have a 55% chance of getting the MAJORITY<br />of seats. Carney is poised to move the election<br />date up to April 28th, much sooner than the<br />previous date in October, in order to capitalize<br />off of this newfound support. With this new swing<br />in the liberals favor, it seems like everything<br />points to them being able to get the most seats in<br />this upcoming election.","Da In Song (10%): Considering previous launches,<br />I would say April is too early. With the emergence<br />of Chinese Open AI and the amount of time it takes<br />for the programmers, devs, and product managers to<br />work an updated program into the system, I would<br />say it will be late October-December","Da In Song (20%): As of right now, the liberal<br />party has 185 candidates of 343. Compared to all<br />the other nominees of all the other parties, the<br />chances of the liberal party's nominees getting<br />elected is at 17-18% (for all other party nominees<br />NOT getting elected). I decided to be generous<br />with my guess because the deadline to submit all<br />nominees isn't upon us yet, and Mark Carney's<br />popularity has increased with Trump's policies.<br />However, this still doesn't change the fact that<br />they have a lack of nominees. They might be a<br />powerful minority, but not a majority.","Diane Johnson (25%): Kemp says he will make a<br />decision after the Georgia legislation ends on<br />April 4th so it is extremely unlikely he will<br />say anything before then and then I think it will<br />take some time for Kemp to make a final decision<br />regarding his run for senate, especially because<br />he is basically confirmed to have the Republican<br />nomination for Georgia reserved. If there is any<br />rush for his announcement, it will be to ease the<br />opinions of the other Republican nominations that<br />are waiting for this announcement which is more<br />likely to be privately spread rather than a public<br />announcement.","Diane Johnson (15%): Kemp has made it clear that<br />one of his biggest priorities is chairing the<br />Republican Governors Association (RGA) as vice<br />chair which currently takes precedence over Kemp<br />senate. He will be vice chair until November<br />of 2025 which gives him time to campaign before<br />the senate election in November 2026 but many<br />speculate that he will further his energies<br />into becoming president of the RGA instead.<br />Furthermore, Kemp has been continuously stating<br />that his priorities are focused on the state of<br />Georgia so I think he will focus on that instead<br />of running for senate. If Kemp did not run a<br />second term in 2007 when his first term in the<br />senate ended, it is unlikely that he will run<br />again.","Diane Johnson (25%): GPT-5, while in production,<br />does not seem to be on the fast track that it once<br />was, which is why I believe OpenAI released 4.5<br />in February, to keep the market open and ready to<br />receive 5 when it comes later in the year. April<br />is very close and this version of GPT was very<br />recently released so I think that OpenAI has some<br />work to do to ensure that it will live up to the<br />hype that it currently has.","Diane Johnson (75%): With the threats that Trump<br />placed on Canada, there has been a high rise<br />of support for Mark Carney, Prime Minister,<br />and due to this growing nationality it is more<br />likely that the liberal party will win the most<br />seats as opposed to other parties. Although the<br />conservative party is following close behind with<br />a 2% margin, I think that with the emphasis Carney<br />is putting on the importance of Canadian pride,<br />the Liberal seats will be most numerous.","Eli Henderson (29%): Kemp is the most formidable<br />Republican in all of Georgia and would be certain<br />to give Ossoff a run for his money, who only<br />won after a runoff by less than 20,000 votes in<br />the 2020 elections. Furthermore, top Republican<br />officials have been calling for Kemp to challenge<br />Ossoff in the '26 elections, which make it seem<br />likely for him to run. However, when looking at<br />the short time frame this question allows, as well<br />as Kemp's comments this year that he has other<br />business to attend to before deciding, it is about<br />1/3 that he will declare his candidacy before<br />April 28.","Eli Henderson (75%): While Kemp has made it clear<br />that he has business to attend to before deciding<br />on a Senate run, he still remains the Republican's<br />most sought-after senate candidate for the '26<br />elections because of his reputation in Georgia,<br />the relative weakness of Ossoff as a candidate,<br />and the mean regression which will likely lead<br />to more Democrat senators in the coming midterms.<br />Therefore, it's likely that Kemp will run for<br />Ossoff's seat in 2026 with wide-ranging republican<br />support, as well as the endorsement of the<br />President.","Eli Henderson (70%): While it has certainly been<br />a net negative past year for liberal candidates<br />across the world, Canada may represent the first<br />phase of a coming pendulum swing that brings<br />success to liberal candidates. The snap elections<br />have been called in order to address the issues<br />posed by the conservative US, such as tariffs and<br />Canada becoming a US State. Because of the drastic<br />unpopularity of these actions, coupled with the<br />fact that Liberals have been on the rise since<br />the resignation of trudeau, I think this is very<br />likely to happen.","Elliana Williams (40%): I am really torn about<br />this question and could not find much evidence to<br />support either side of the prediction. Kemp has<br />said that he will make a statement soon, but right<br />now since they are in session, he wants to focus<br />on that. There is a lot of pull for Republicans<br />to take Jon Ossoff's seat in the 2026 senate<br />election, and Kemp is already the favorite for<br />that. However, people wonder if he will run for<br />President in 2028. Historically, Senators do not<br />do well when they are senators before they are<br />Presidential candidates. I think that if he does<br />run, he wont announce it before April 28th because<br />that does not give much time to prepare after the<br />session ends on April 1st.","Elliana Williams (65%): I think that if Kemp does<br />not run for President, he will run for Senate.<br />I think that if he does run for Senate, he will<br />announce it later than April 28th. Since the<br />Georgia legislature is in session, he has not<br />made much commentary or hinting toward it. There<br />is a chance because he is the favored Republican<br />candidate and people want him to beat out Ossoff,<br />but I could see him running for president as well.","Elliana Williams (13%): OpenAI still needs to<br />release Chat GPT 4.5 to the public, the precursor<br />for CPT 5. The precursor is rolling out later<br />than people suspected, as they have announced<br />that there will be an update around 2 years ago.<br />I think that they will not release 5 within the<br />timeline limit of this question because they have<br />to run 4.5 and make sure everything works smoothly<br />and I do not think there is enough time.","Elliana Williams (72%): Though the liberal party<br />in Canada recently had declined support due to<br />Trudeau's performance, I think that the major<br />thing that will pull the liberals into having<br />the most seats in their FPTP system is the \"Trump<br />Effect\". Since it seems that people in Canada<br />widely believe that Trump's tariffs and want<br />to make them the 51st state, the liberal party<br />seems best equipped to fight against Trump, but<br />also win because they are against Trump. It is<br />hard to see a reality where conservatives win in<br />Canada, when there is a huge distaste for American<br />conservatives. The poll numbers have been largely<br />bolstered by Trump's statements and actions.","Emma Allen (22%): It is unlikely that Governor<br />Brian Kemp will announce a Senate run before<br />April 28. He has emphasized his commitment to his<br />current legislative agenda, including Georgia’s<br />tort reform efforts and his role as chair of the<br />Republican Governors Association. Kemp has not<br />provided a clear timeline for his decision, and<br />given his strong name recognition and political<br />standing, he does not need an early start to<br />campaign. Instead, he is likely to wait until<br />after the legislative session concludes before<br />making any formal announcement.","Emma Allen (72%): While Kemp has not confirmed<br />his plans, it is highly probable that he will run<br />for the U.S. Senate in 2026. His term as governor<br />ends in January 2027, and running for Senate would<br />allow him to remain politically active at a high<br />level. He has strong support within the Republican<br />Party and a clear path to the GOP nomination.<br />However, factors such as his preference for<br />executive roles and the challenge of facing Jon<br />Ossoff may influence his final decision.","Emma Allen (40%): In February 2025, OpenAI<br />released GPT-4.5 (the last model before GPT-5).<br />Looking at a timeline of each GPT model release,<br />OpenAI's releases have been faster in the past<br />12 months, but it seems there have been delays<br />in bringing GPT-5 to market. Researchers say<br />safety testing is likely the largest hurdle for<br />its release along with widespread fears about<br />the potential dangers of AI, including misuse.<br />I think until we hear solutions/more discussion<br />around GPT-5 and its key issues (which could take<br />months), it is more unlikely than likely it will<br />be released before April 28.","Emma Allen (71%): Recent polls suggest<br />that the liberals hold a slight lead over<br />the conservatives, with figures indicating<br />approximately 42% support for the liberals<br />compared to 35% for the conservatives. This shift<br />is largely due to Carney's economic expertise<br />and the public's desire for strong leadership<br />in response to U.S/ Trump’s latest moves.<br />Additionally, I think Carney will act off of<br />this latest high of public support & request a<br />dissolution of the Canadian parliament very soon<br />and I don't find reason liberal support changes<br />too much before it is time for the snap election.","Emma Pastor (55%): Due to the fact that Georgia<br />is currently a blue state (democratic - Senators<br />Warnock and Ossoff), when it has historically<br />been a pretty Republican dominated state, many<br />are speculating that a switch in the GA senators’<br />party is on the horizon, with many naming Kemp<br />as the “ideal” candidate to rival the vulnerable<br />Ossoff and flip his seat. Especially with the new<br />administration, with a Republican president, we<br />may see more people voting red in GA for senate<br />seats. Kemp has expressed that he has a lot on his<br />plate currently, with a big legislative session<br />in the state, however, this session is set to<br />adjourn April 4, therefore the possibility of an<br />announcement before the 28th is not out of the<br />question","Emma Pastor (80%): Kemp is currently favored<br />as the forerunner for Senate candidates in GA<br />representing the Republican party. Though he has<br />not announced his candidacy it is anticipated that<br />he will in the coming months, as many see a senate<br />seat party clip in the horizon","Emma Pastor (15%): Considering the recent release<br />of GPT-4.5 this past month (on Feb. 27th, 2025),<br />and the overwhelming evidence that government<br />regulation might be proposed in the coming<br />months intending to slow down the development of<br />generative AI programs like OpenAI’s Ghat-GPT, I<br />do not foresee a reality where GPT-5 is released<br />before April 28th. While developers are most<br />definitely working on the program currently, the<br />huge leap in software capability will need more<br />development time before being released to the<br />public.","Emma Pastor (60%): Currently, the liberals<br />are narrowly leading the conservative party in<br />terms of projections for this upcoming Canadian<br />election. Mark Carney, the new replacement<br />for Trudeau, is of the liberal party himself.<br />As of 2 days ago, the liberals are favored at<br />42%, compared to the projections of 36% for the<br />conservatives","Emma Peterson (60%): I said 60% because Kemp has<br />stated he believes there should be a republican in<br />the Georgia senate seat and that could happen this<br />election cycle. He won't announce he's running<br />as of right now because of his schedule, but<br />the probability amps up after April 4th when the<br />legislative session adjourns. He has hinted at an<br />announcement but that could either be to declare<br />he's running or declare he's not. In my opinion,<br />the odds of him announcing he is running is<br />higher, especially since hypothetical prediction<br />sites have him winning over Ossoff if he were to<br />run.","Emma Peterson (60%): My probability remains the<br />same at 60%. If he announces he'll run for senate<br />by April, then he'll run for senate in 2026.<br />The reason I don't have this higher is because I<br />believe the sooner an announcement the better for<br />Kemp. Time is of the essence in terms of elections<br />and you need to rally support for as long as you<br />can before November 3rd. If he doesn't announce<br />by the end of April I don't see higher odds of it<br />happening later in the year.","Emma Peterson (20%): I said 20% because any news<br />coverage of this happening has been extremely<br />minimal. There also seems to be a 4.5 model which<br />was just recently released at the end of February.<br />Because of this I believe we'll see CPT-5 in the<br />middle of the year in the summer. I do think this<br />is going to happen in 2025, April just seems too<br />soon with the recent release.","Emma Peterson (66%): I said 66% because as of<br />right now the liberal party currently holds the<br />most seats in Canada's parliament with 153, where<br />conservatives hold 120. While numbers rose in<br />favor for conservatives during Trudeau's term,<br />once he stepped down the numbers evened out. Now<br />with the trade war against Trump, it seems like<br />the Liberal party is expected to win the most<br />seats.","Ethan Joyce (65%): Georgia's legislative session<br />adjourns April 4, freeing his schedule for a<br />potential announcement. His increasing involvement<br />in national politics and ICE partnership suggests<br />federal positioning. Strong recent polling<br />against Ossoff demonstrates viability, while other<br />Republican candidates' willingness to drop out<br />indicates party consolidation. The timing aligns<br />with typical announcement patterns, particularly<br />coming after the state legislative session<br />concludes, giving him a clear window for a major<br />announcement. Alternatively, he could be planning<br />a presidential run, or announce after the April 28<br />deadline.","Ethan Joyce (82%): I think there is still a<br />possibility that Kemp prefers to run for the<br />presidency in 2028 as opposed to running for the<br />senate, considering these sorts of competitive<br />senate elections are usually a referendum on the<br />sitting presidency. I think he does have higher<br />political ambitions, but from party pressure will<br />likely run against Ossoff for the highly contested<br />senate seat.","Ethan Joyce (25%): The average time between<br />each release is approximately 16 months, and<br />the latest release was GPT 4.5 at the end of<br />February. Given that GPT-4.5 is a refinement<br />and not a major new leap like GPT-4, a fully new<br />model like GPT-5 would probably take longer to<br />prepare. Furthermore, releasing GPT-5 too soon<br />after GPT-4.5 could risk quality issues or lack of<br />sufficient improvements to justify a new version.<br />The shortest amount of time between releases has<br />been four months (GPT 3.5 to GPT 4). Also, ChatGPT<br />said so!","Ethan Joyce (72.5%): Based on CBC's Poll Tracker<br />forecast, I predict the Liberal Party will win<br />the most seats with 77% confidence. The data<br />shows Liberals have a 53% chance of winning a<br />majority and a 24% chance of winning the most<br />seats without a majority. Combined, this gives<br />them a 77% probability of being the largest party<br />in Parliament. The Conservatives have only a 23%<br />total chance (6% majority, 17% plurality without<br />majority). These numbers come from simulations of<br />5,000 elections, accounting for each party's seat<br />projection ranges and polling error margins. The<br />methodology is robust, and while no prediction<br />is certain, the Liberals have a clear statistical<br />advantage in securing the most seats. I adjusted<br />my estimate downward because of the potential for<br />overconfidence, especially considering there is<br />time between when an election could be held and<br />public opinion right now.","Ethan Marcum (32%): I feel that there is a lot to<br />think about when it comes to deciding if you run<br />for senate or not. In my opinion he would likely<br />win, but it would be a hard fought race. He will<br />either decide to run now or not at all in my<br />opinion. There are plenty willing republicans who<br />are willing to run if Kemp decides not to. That<br />plays a big factor in my reasoning.","Ethan Marcum (65%): He is a fairly prominent<br />political figure who holds a lot of promise and<br />seems to hold a decent amount of popularity.<br />His resume is certainly decent enough to run for<br />senate. I feel it is a little late to decide to<br />run for senate, not that it is impossible. But his<br />campaign would be a little late. He would be going<br />up ossof who has already been in senate, but I<br />feel that trump might call on him to run.","Ethan Marcum (25%): The gpt4.5 just released<br />and there are clear desires for 5.0 to come out.<br />However, it seems it will come out closer towards<br />the end of may. It seems that it could even come<br />out later than that date. There is a chance but I<br />feel that the odds are fairly low.","Ethan Marcum (70%): They have had good polling<br />and seem to have been gaining favor in recent<br />trade war. All indications show that they will<br />most likely gain back the majority that they have<br />recently not had. This all seems to be purely from<br />the recent political issues, specifically with the<br />US.","Grace Mccann (35%): Kemp is currently the Top GOP<br />pick for the Republicans in the upcoming senate<br />race. However Kemp has stated that he has a lot<br />on his plate right now insinuating it would be a<br />little bit before he announces his run for senate.<br />He said \"I'm in the middle of my legislative<br />session. We've got a big tort reform fight<br />going on. I'm chairing the Republican Governors<br />Association. I made a commitment on that.\" However<br />the GA legislative session is scheduled to adjourn<br />on April 4. This means that there is a chance<br />he could announce in mid-late April when the GA<br />legislation is adjourned.","Grace Mccann (27%): The CEO of OpenAI stated that<br />it \"will be coming in months\" in February which<br />implies that it will probably be later in the year<br />and that they are not quite ready. Most of the<br />discussion online said that they think the most<br />likely month is December but it will probably come<br />out sometime in mid-late 2025.","Grace Reichelderfer (40%): OpenAI has released<br />GPT-4.5, the last model before ChatGPT-5. Clues<br />from Sam Altman's social media posts suggest that<br />GPT-5 might be just around the corner. OpenAI's<br />releases have been faster in the past 12 months.<br />But seems there have been delays in bringing<br />GPT-5 to market. GPT-4.5 \"Orion\" was released to<br />ChatGPT Pro users on February 27, 2025. OpenAI<br />comments and industry rumors indicate that GPT-5<br />could launch within \"weeks or months\". Reports<br />indicate that the model is still in the training<br />phase. After it completes its training, it will be<br />extensively tested for security. However, a date<br />has not yet been released.","Hampton Barrineau (20%): I have been following<br />this race for a minute now and I was convinced<br />after Kemp released a statement about a month ago.<br />It was not directly stated but Kemp seems to have<br />ambitions for the presidency and doesn’t want to<br />ruin his name with a Dem wave year. Additionally,<br />he doesn’t have Trump support too, so it would be<br />a nasty primary.","Hampton Barrineau (35%): According to the<br />investment journalism of Binance, Chat GPT five is<br />going to be announced soon. I Believe that it will<br />take time for the new AI to be fully developed and<br />finished. This is especially as new durations of<br />AI take more and more time to work and execute.<br />Lastly Chat GPT 5 needs to be impressive in the<br />wake of Deep Seek.","Hampton Barrineau (75%): Liberals in Canada are<br />successfully, taking steps to actively improve<br />their perception within the broader public by<br />dozens of points and very quick periods. Through<br />careful strategic Positioning and frankly luck,<br />Carney seems poised to capitalized off of the<br />unique anti-Trump moment in Canadian politics.","Hannah Carson (22%): I do not think Governor<br />Kemp announce a run for US Senate before April<br />28. There is no urgency right now for him to<br />announce even if he is planning on running in<br />2026 because it is so far off. Additionally, being<br />already in office he doesn't have to announce<br />as early to gain traction like other less known<br />candidates.Governor Kemp has said he has a lot<br />on his plate being head of the RGA and that ends<br />April 4th so it would be a quick turn around<br />between the end of his duties and running for<br />Senate. Governor Kemp seems to be cautious about<br />running so I believe he will need more time to<br />consider his options.","Hannah Carson (62%): I do believe Governor Kemp<br />will run for US Senate in 2026. He is getting a<br />lot of pressure from the Republican Party to run<br />for Senate because he is the strongest candidate<br />to run against Jon Ossoff. Governor Kemp is a very<br />ambitious guy and I believe he is the type of man<br />who would run for Senate after being Governor.<br />However, he has been asked in interviews if he<br />is going to announce a run for senate and he said<br />he has a lot on his plate right now. However,<br />the legislative session ends on April 4th, giving<br />him plenty of time to relax and consider a senate<br />election before the end of the year.","Hannah Carson (30%): I do not think OpenAI<br />will release GPT-5 by April 28. Although it is<br />possible, it costs a lot to make an AI model and<br />takes a good amount of time to make the product.<br />ChatGPT 4.5 got released in February, and the<br />company hinted that GPT 5 will be available within<br />months making mosts experts predictions mid-2025.<br />As AI becomes more popular, there has been more<br />pressure from the government to make sure it is<br />\"safe and reliable.\" I believe OpenAI will take<br />its time making sure the more advanced AI model is<br />safe for the public to use.","Hannah Carson (60%): I believe the liberal party<br />will win the most seats in Parliament although<br />it has been very close. The rising trade tensions<br />between US and Canada due to the tariffs has<br />caused rising support for the liberal party of<br />Canada as they have held a strong opposition to<br />the tariffs. The conservatives could win however<br />because they have now switched to a negative<br />stance against the tariffs recently and former<br />Prime Minister Trudeau was a member of the liberal<br />party and was not a popular leader. The former<br />Prime Minister being liberal hurts the liberals<br />odds but the rally against tariffs as a country<br />helps their odds. Therefore, I feel like there is<br />more of a chance the liberal party wins the most<br />seats in Parliament but it I very possible for the<br />conservatives to win as well.","Isaac Fleischer (28%): Kemp has said that he won’t<br />announce a potential campaign until after the<br />current legislative season. The season ends on<br />April 4, meaning that there is a 24 day window for<br />kemp to declare his campaign. There is a lot of<br />pressure on kemp to run and I would not be shocked<br />to see him announce a campaign before April 28.","Isaac Fleischer (0%): The earliest timeline I<br />could find for the release of GPT 5 predicts that<br />it will be released in December of 2025. There<br />have been no announcements or previews of the<br />product and no announced release date. With just<br />over a month remaining in the semester, it is very<br />unlikely that chat gpt 5 will be released by the<br />end of April.","Isaac Fleischer (65%): Canada just elected a prime<br />minister from the liberal party. It seems that<br />attitudes in Canada are leaning towards the left.<br />Additionally, most articles I could find say that<br />the liberal party is in line for a successful<br />election due to the pressures of the current trade<br />war with the US","Isabella Molina (40%): I believe Governor Kemp<br />will run, but maybe not by the given date. I<br />actually think he’ll announce it in May. Kemp has<br />expressed interest, but I feel that by now there<br />would have been more speculation about his run<br />if he planned to announce it soon. Perhaps he is<br />waiting for a slower month to make this decision<br />since it seems he has a lot on his plate. However,<br />there is still a good chance he will announce it<br />before April 28.","Isabella Molina (10%): It seems OpenAI has not<br />released any strong details about this update, and<br />based on previous patterns, it typically provides<br />hints or context about upcoming releases. From my<br />research, it does seem likely to happen at some<br />point, but given that it is already mid-March, I<br />feel like we would have been given more details<br />by now if it were going to be released next month.<br />So, I put my prediction at a 10.","Isabella Molina (80%): Recent polls show the<br />Liberals are leading the Conservatives, and public<br />support for them is growing. A reason to this is<br />because of trumps policies making people vote with<br />the liberal party. Also it does seem Mark Carmel<br />is a popular leader to many which increase his<br />chances. With how numbers are looking and what<br />people are speculating and saying , it looks very<br />likely they’ll win the most seats in the election.","Jacob Weiss (85%): Brian Kemp is an extremely<br />popular governor who in polls say will beat ossof.<br />Kemp has quoted he hasn't announced yet due to<br />the the legislative session that ends April 4th.<br />I believe after the legislative session ends there<br />is a very good chance due to party pressure and<br />popularity that gov Kemp will run.","Jacob Weiss (10%): The CEO of chatgpt released<br />a brief timeline stating chat gpt 4.5 will be<br />the companies next big release. Considering 4.5<br />hasn't released yet and we are in March and still<br />haven't got that yet if for some reason it comes<br />out tommorow I doubt they will only let there new<br />product be new for a month.","Jacob Weiss (80%): With the liberal party now<br />having the pm the snap election polling seems<br />to be favoring his party. The conservative party<br />in Canada the 2nd most popular party in is seen<br />as weak against trump. All polling points to the<br />liberal party winning the most seats.","Jake Garrard (34%): Governor Kemp, although very<br />likely to run for US Senate, still has some time<br />left being the governor. There is more than a<br />year until election season for 2026, and although<br />he will need to run his campaign before then,<br />he has not indicated in any way that he will be<br />beginning that in the next month. I think that his<br />announcement will come after April 28th.","Jake Garrard (28%): I do not believe that GPT-5<br />will be released before April 28th, since GPT-4.5<br />has not yet been released. Sam Altman, CEO of<br />OpenAI, has hinted that GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 would be<br />released soon, however he has not said how soon.<br />Most predict that 4.5 will be released in the next<br />few weeks, while GPT-5 will be released in a few<br />months, likely more towards June or July.","Jake Garrard (72%): According to many sources,<br />the liberals are the leading party in the polls<br />right now. It looks as if in this snap election<br />the liberals might have some sort of political<br />resurrection, as there has been an obvious<br />downturn in liberal support, not only in Canada<br />but worldwide. I think it is likely that the<br />Liberal party will win the most seats, with a 72%<br />probability.","Jenny Qiu (60%): As Kemp's second term as governor<br />ends in 2026, he will not be permitted to a third<br />term and will look to other offices, the main one<br />being the Senate. Although he has yet to announce<br />a bid, there is a lot of pressure for him to be<br />Republican candidate, due to his popularity and<br />greater ability (than other Republicans) to defeat<br />Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate running for<br />the same seat. There is also a sense of urgency<br />for him to announce whether or not he will run<br />for the Senate, because other Republicans are not<br />going to run if he does, so they're waiting for<br />his decision.","Jenny Qiu (65%): The Conservative Party of Canada<br />had a lead in polls from summer 2023 to early<br />this year. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau<br />lost support from his own Liberal Party and had<br />very high disapproval ratings across the country,<br />thus he resigned and the Liberal Party selected<br />Mark Carney as the new leader of the party and<br />the Prime Minister. Since Carney's appointment,<br />polls indicate the Liberal Party overcoming the<br />Conservative Party. Liberal Party has held the<br />most seats in the three parliaments since 2015.","Jerusalem Greenberg (40%): I don't really see<br />this as a remote possibility. Maybe GPT-5 will be<br />released at some point in 2025, most predictions<br />have it slated as very late 2025 or at least<br />the second half, but in February the official<br />statement was that GPT-4.5 would come out within<br />weeks (likely meaning a few months) and that GPT-5<br />would be months from then. February to April seems<br />like a quick jump.","Jerusalem Greenberg (60%): I don't know anything<br />about foreign policy or foreign affairs, there's<br />a reason I didn't take that major and I took<br />Political Science instead. However, from my<br />research, from what I can see, because of the<br />election of Mark Carney as Prime Minister, the<br />Liberal party in Canada is expected to triumph<br />over the other parties. The conservatives (known<br />often as \"Tories\" in both Canada and the UK) are<br />staying relatively still and are steadily losing<br />power because of their stagnant nature.","Jessy Lee (10%): Governor Kemp's term ends January<br />11, 2027 and Georgia's senate election will take<br />place on November 3, 2026. Kemp has not announced<br />whether or not he will be running for senate<br />due to his work load currently. According to Fox<br />News, \"Kemp isn't ready to make an announcement,<br />emphasizing that he's \"really got a lot on my<br />plate right now.\" He states that he his currently<br />in the middle of his legislation currently,<br />fighting a big tort reform, and chairing<br />republican governors association. His current<br />fight over tort reforms gained immense support<br />in the beginning and progressed significantly<br />through Georgia's legislative process. Recently<br />it has seen backlash and skepticism due to belief<br />that this bill is a handout to businesses and<br />insurance companies. Due to this, I believe it<br />will not be resolved as soon as it was originally<br />looking like. With this holding Kemp back and<br />with other factors, I believe the probability of<br />Kemp announcing his run for senate will not occur<br />before April 28.","Jessy Lee (87%): Governor Kemp is coming up on<br />the end of his second consecutive 4-year term<br />this next year. The Georgia Senate election<br />will occur on November 3, 2026. While Kemp has<br />not stated whether or not he will be running in<br />senate elections, I do not predict he would pursue<br />other career paths. I predict he will run for a<br />senate position due to his popularity and high<br />approval. There have been 5 previous governors who<br />ran for senate positions. Jon Ossoff is the most<br />vulnerable Senator due to his narrow margin win,<br />strong republican opposition, and the republican<br />party gaining strength on congress. Kemp expressed<br />that he has not made a decision due to his work<br />load currently. So I believe the probability of<br />Kemp announcing whether or not he will be running<br />in the Senate in 20206 is high.","Jessy Lee (35%): OpenAI has announced their<br />release of the GPT-5 but not a set date. According<br />to the most recent information, OpenAI CEO Sam<br />Altman announced on X in February 2025 that<br />ChatGPT-5 is expected to be released in \"weeks<br />or months.\" He stated that GPT-4.5 will be<br />launched first, with GPT-5 coming sometime later<br />in the year. While many speculate the release<br />to be earlier in the year due to pressure from<br />competitors, I think the probability of it being<br />released before a little over a month is low.","Jessy Lee (94%): I believe the probability of the<br />liberal party securing the most amount of seats in<br />parliament is very likely. This is due to leading<br />national support, electoral polls such as 338<br />Canada which projects liberals to win 177 seats<br />and is higher than the majority which is 172. With<br />the chaos of the trade wars, Canada's nationalist<br />sentiment has grown which could benefit the<br />liberals, especially if voters see them as more<br />capable of managing foreign relations and national<br />economic policy. The biggest uncertainty is over<br />the centrists, but the Liberals have traditionally<br />performed well in these regions, which tend to be<br />more populous and crucial for seat counts.","Joey Khashan (76%): Governor Kemp has stated<br />that he wants to finish his duties as Governor<br />before he announces any further political plans.<br />Considering that Georgia’s legislative session is<br />supposed to end on April 4th, that gives him 24<br />days to announce his running as Senator. However,<br />his approval rating was 61% in January. Because<br />he is a popular Governor, I believe he has a high<br />chance of winning the senate race (or at least<br />higher than any other potential candidate). This<br />makes me think he is more likely to run if he<br />believes he has a very good chance of winning.","Joey Khashan (28%): I find it unlikely that OpenAI<br />will release a product called GPT-5 before April<br />28. When OpenAI released GPT-3.5, it took them<br />3.5 months to release GPT-4. Considering the fact<br />that GPT-4.5 was released February 27th, I find<br />it unlikely they will be able to push out GPT-5.<br />Another issue is that they may release a product,<br />but OpenAI decides not to name it GPT-5. However,<br />they are competing with DeepSeek which may end up<br />with OpenAI pushing a product out faster.","Joey Khashan (70%): According to multiple sources,<br />the polls are showing that the Liberal Party has<br />between a 60% and 75% chance of winning the most<br />seats in Canada’s Parliament. Considering that the<br />newly elected Prime Minister is also a Liberal,<br />I think that it is likely that the Liberal<br />Party will end this election with a majority in<br />Parliament.","Joshua Kang (43%): Nothing is certain yet - Kemp<br />has hinted that he will make an announcement in<br />the future, but he has pressing obligations at the<br />moment. He said his top priority is the conflict<br />concerning tort reform in the Georgia legislature,<br />which does not conclude until April 4. He may need<br />some time dealing with issues in his home state<br />before announcing a senate run.","Joshua Kang (62%): Currently, Governor Kemp's<br />main concerns are in his home state, especially<br />the upcoming Georgia legislative session on April<br />4. However, once these are out of the way, he<br />has plenty of time to announce a run for senate.<br />Currently, the NSRC considers Kemp their top pick.<br />It is certainly a decent possibility that Kemp<br />will consider the odds good enough for a run for<br />senate.","Joshua Kang (5%): OpenAI releasing GPT-5 before<br />April 28 seems overly ambitious. As of now, the<br />most concrete answer given by CEO Sam Altman was<br />that the release date was in \"months\", back in<br />February 2025. Previous estimates were delayed<br />due to issues that cropped up in the developmental<br />process. Due to this, an April 28th release date<br />is unlikely.","Joshua Kang (56%): Previously, the Conservatives<br />were leading strongly in polls. However, new<br />leadership, and backlash from the Trump-led<br />tariffs have led to a resurgence in the Liberal<br />Party's popularity. However, the Conservative<br />Party still holds some popularity, making it<br />uncertain that the Liberal Party will continue to<br />hold their lead for the election. However, it does<br />seem that the Liberal Party has a solid chance,<br />much better than late 2024.","Julia Loggins (23%): From an outside view, typical<br />Senate race announcements can happen as early as<br />1-2 years for candidates like incumbents to 2-4<br />months before the election. In recent interviews,<br />Governor Kemp has stated that he is not in a<br />rush to make a decision as he is focusing on his<br />day job, the governor of Georgia. In addition,<br />focusing on the things that he promised such as<br />leading the Republican Governors Association.<br />However, the legislative session adjourns on April<br />4 which could increase the likelihood of sooner<br />rather than later.","Julia Loggins (28%): OpenAI released GPT 4.5<br />on February 27 sparking rumors that GPT-5 could<br />launch within weeks or months. I think a turn<br />around of two months is unlikely. OpenAI will<br />want to focus on GPT 5 being completely ready<br />rather than push for it to be released as fast as<br />possible. In addition, Polymarket currently has<br />a release of a model before July, an even later<br />date, at 39%. I just think the timeframe is too<br />small for GPT 5 to be released by April 28.","Julia Loggins (62%): According to CBS news, there<br />is currently a 53% chance of the Liberal Party<br />winning a majority with the guardian showing a<br />55% chance. The snap election comes from rising<br />tensions with President Trump with a rise in<br />Canadian nationalism. The outcome of the election<br />is still up in the air as the Liberal Party is<br />trailing other national parties in candidate<br />nominations prior to the snap election. I am<br />leaning more towards a majority Liberal Party<br />because of the citizens viewpoint on the imposed<br />tariffs as well as threats of annexation.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (30%): Despite Brian Kemp being<br />under pressure to run for Senate as his time as<br />governor comes to an end, I am not confident that<br />he will pursue this opportunity and if he does,<br />not within this amount of time. There have been<br />indicators that he may be interested in running<br />for president in 2028 which would not be feasible<br />if he were to run for, and likely win a Senate<br />seat. Additionally, many governors like Kemp who<br />meet their term limit and are urged to run for<br />Senate see the change as a bit of a downgrade and<br />often turn down the opportunity.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (20%): OpenAI CEO Sam Altman<br />responded to a question on X about when users<br />could expect to see a GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 release,<br />simply stating \"weeks / months\". His reply was<br />posted on February 12th of this year and GPT-4.5<br />was released ten days later on the 27th. Given<br />Altman's ambiguous wording, I cannot be very<br />certain about when GPT-5 will be released,<br />however, given OpenAIs history of releases from<br />GPT-3, onward, I would guess that GPT-5 will not<br />be released by April 28th.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (60%): Canada's Liberal Party has<br />seen an immense revival within the past months;<br />political analyst Philippe Fournier has predicted<br />that the Liberals have a 55% chance of majority<br />government in the upcoming snap election, rising<br />greatly from a previously predicted 1%. I am<br />basing my prediction off of expert opinion rather<br />than my own so I have landed on 60%.","Kelsey Dyar (30%): I think there is a 30 percent<br />chance that OpenAI will release a product named<br />GPT-5. At the moment, most users are using ChatGPT<br />4, while those who pay around two hundred dollars<br />a month have previewed access to ChatGPT 4.5.<br />Since there is a 4.5 version that we know about<br />that is still not available to the full public, I<br />do not think it is realistic to expect a brand new<br />version by April 28th.","Kyle Smith (20%): I find it very likely that Kemp<br />will run for Senate but I find it less likely that<br />it will happen by April 28th. There are many eyes<br />on the current governor of Georgia as he may want<br />to run for the seat that Jon Osssoff currently<br />has. Kmep has said he is interested in it but<br />he also has shared that he wants to focus on his<br />current responsibilities. He also may be waiting<br />to announce he is running due to the current scope<br />of the republican party.","Kyle Smith (80%): I find it very likely that Kemp<br />will run for Senate by 2026. There are many eyes<br />on the current governor of Georgia as he may want<br />to run for the seat that Jon Osssoff currently<br />has. Although there is much questioning on whether<br />or not he will run, I find it likely that he will<br />announce a campaign later this year. This is due<br />to the past occurrences of his explicit interest<br />for the role.","Kyle Smith (25%): To find a good percent to give<br />this prediction, we must look at the relevant<br />timeline of all past releases and the relevant and<br />current information regarding the new model. So<br />taking all of the data into account, the spaced<br />out releases by open ai creates a base prediction<br />as a 30% and with the addition of the new data<br />and the issues facing the company currently,<br />there will be a decrease in the base prediction<br />of about 5-10%. With the release of the 4.5 model<br />already out, there will be an even lower chance<br />there is a new release. Accounting all the recent<br />data collected by reading articles, I base my<br />official prediction as a 15-25% probability. I am<br />not completely knowledgeable about the release of<br />the 5th model and what will happen but with the<br />gathered information I find it more probable to<br />give it a 25% rather than a 15%. Thus, I will give<br />it a 25% overall.","Lawton Smith (30%): As of March 19, 2025, there’s<br />no clear answer on whether Georgia Governor Brian<br />Kemp will announce a run for the U.S. Senate<br />before April 28. Kemp, a popular Republican<br />governor who’s finishing his final term, is widely<br />seen as a strong contender to challenge Democratic<br />Senator Jon Ossoff in 2026. But so far, he hasn’t<br />set a timeline for his decision. Rumors have been<br />swirling about his potential candidacy, and some<br />reports suggest he might wait until after the<br />Georgia legislative session wraps up on April 4.<br />In interviews, Kemp has said he’s “got a lot on<br />my plate right now” and that he’ll “have something<br />to say on that down the road,” which suggests<br />he’s still weighing his options. Analysts are<br />split—some believe he’s laying the groundwork for<br />a campaign through his national role as chair of<br />the Republican Governors Association, while others<br />think he may hold off making a decision until<br />later in 2025.","Lawton Smith (60%): The question of whether<br />the Liberal Party will win the most seats in<br />Parliament remains genuinely uncertain despite<br />their current lead in popular support. While<br />the Liberals have experienced an extraordinary<br />resurgence under Mark Carney's leadership,<br />translating this into parliamentary dominance<br />faces significant challenges. The efficiency<br />of vote distribution, regional concentration<br />of support, and relative commitment levels of<br />supporters will ultimately determine the outcome.<br />So I have about zero clue about this one.","Levi Thomas (60%): Kemp has recently expressed a<br />focus on his gubernatorial efforts, however the<br />legislative session is set to end by April 4.<br />If he decides to announce an early bid, it will<br />likely be shortly after the end of the current<br />legislative session. Furthermore, Kemp can no<br />longer run for the office of governor after<br />this term, which means it would be politically<br />advantageous for his career to pursue the Senate.<br />Kemp also has the Republican Party seeking his<br />entry into the Senate race, as Republicans want<br />a strong contender to Jon Ossoff. The difficulty<br />in this question lies primarily in whether or<br />not Kemp decides to have an early announcement<br />for his bid to the Senate, as he may hold off on<br />announcing a Senate bid for a number of political<br />reasons.","Levi Thomas (85%): Betting markets have Kemp as<br />the clear favorite to run in the Senate race in<br />2026, and he has huge support from the Republican<br />Party to enter the race. Seeing as Kemp can no<br />longer run for reelection after this term, a<br />position in the Senate seems to be an obvious step<br />in his political career.","Levi Thomas (23%): There has been a significant<br />lack in specifics when dealing with the possible<br />release of Chat GPT-5, as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman<br />has left the release exceptionally vague. There<br />is a possibility of GPT-5's release within<br />the deadline as the GPT-4.5 model was released<br />within the \"weeks\" that Altman promised. However,<br />the release of GPT-4.5 has been staggered in a<br />research preview rather than made available to<br />all users. This development may point to a slower<br />rollout overall for GPT-5, as the GPT-5 model is<br />more ambitious and proposed to be released to all<br />users upon release. Furthermore, OpenAI ran into<br />cost and development issues with GPT-4.5. One can<br />only imagine how many more issues they may have<br />developing a model with extensively more proposed<br />capabilities.","Levi Thomas (80%): The Liberals have managed to<br />separate themselves from Trudeau’s unpopularity<br />and have an easy way of rallying supporters due<br />to positioning themselves as the best and most<br />immediate opposition to Donald Trump’s tariffs and<br />threats against Canadian sovereignty. They have<br />come back from a tremendous political deficit and<br />there is a possibility they could lose momentum,<br />but with an election set to be called on April 28<br />it seems unlikely such a drastic change in voter<br />behavior would happen. The Conservative Party has<br />lost their most effective talking points since<br />Trudeau resigned and Carney slashed Canada’s<br />carbon tax, and it is uncertain how they plan<br />to message against Liberals as the snap election<br />nears.","Lillie Puhrmann (45%): Governor Brian Kemp hasn't<br />really set a specific timeline for announcing<br />anything about the U.S. Senate, but he has<br />mentioned that it's something he's considering.<br />Since Georgia’s legislative session wraps up on<br />April 4, he might hold off on making any political<br />moves until after that date. As the chair of the<br />Republican Governors Association, he’s really<br />concentrating on state leadership right now, but<br />national Republicans are pushing him to consider<br />running. There's a chance that an announcement<br />could happen before April 28, but he might decide<br />to hold off for a bit longer to evaluate the<br />political situation.","Lillie Puhrmann (70%): Governor Brian Kemp is a<br />popular Republican candidate for the 2026 U.S.<br />Senate race in Georgia, thanks to his solid<br />political position and the fact that he can't run<br />for governor again. The GOP is really looking to<br />take on Senator Jon Ossoff, and Kemp's name keeps<br />popping up as a leading candidate. His national<br />profile has increased due to leadership positions<br />such as chairing the Republican Governors<br />Association, making a Senate run a sensible next<br />move. But he might also consider other political<br />chances, like a possible presidential run in 2028.","Lillie Puhrmann (10%): According to the most<br />recent updates, OpenAI hasn't announced an<br />official release date for GPT-5 yet. Sam Altman,<br />the CEO, recently mentioned that GPT-5 might be<br />released \"within months\" following the February<br />2025 launch of GPT-4.5, also known as \"Orion.\"<br />Reports indicate a likely release in late May<br />2025, making an April 28 launch highly improbable.<br />Based on this timeline, it seems that the chances<br />of OpenAI launching GPT-5 before that date are<br />10%. The company is probably still working on<br />improving the model before it gets fully released.","Lillie Puhrmann (77%): Recent polling indicates<br />that the Liberal Party is gaining traction as<br />Canada approaches its snap election, showing a<br />rise in support from voters. This increase is<br />somewhat driven by a rise in nationalism caused by<br />trade conflicts with the United States, especially<br />comments made by President Trump. Because of<br />this, people are starting to support the Liberals<br />more, making them likely to win the most seats<br />in Parliament even after facing some difficulties<br />earlier.","Mabry Cartwright (60%): There has been speculation<br />around whether or not Governor Kemp will run<br />against Incumbent Jon Ossoff in Georgia’s upcoming<br />Senate race. Gov. Kemp has recently told the<br />public that he is only focused on his current role<br />as Governor and has offered little indication of<br />his future plans. He has made it very clear that<br />he believes the seat needs to be flipped, but he<br />currently is not announcing. This is due to his<br />hectic schedule during the Legislative session.<br />However, I believe that he will enter the Senate<br />race before April 28 because the Legislative<br />Session ends April 3rd.","Mabry Cartwright (85%): Unlike my answer from the<br />question with the April constraint, I am much more<br />confident that Governor Kemp will run for Senate<br />in 2026. It is the perfect time for him to step<br />into the role with his time as Governor coming<br />to an end. He is also being heavily supported at<br />a time when Republicans find it crucial to flip<br />the seat in Senate. Kemp has also hinted that it<br />is a possibility, but he will not be releasing<br />information until after his busy season dies down.","Mabry Cartwright (25%): I do not believe that<br />GPT-5 will be released before April 28th.<br />According to a few articles, each GPT has been<br />released roughly 33 months apart from each other<br />and GPT-4 was released roughly 19 months. This<br />leads me to believe that GPT-5 will most likely<br />be released closer to December or January but most<br />likely not April.","Mabry Cartwright (58%): This is an incredibly<br />tough question because it currently sits at<br />roughly a 50/50 battle between the Liberal<br />and Conservative party. However, I am placing<br />the probability that the Liberal Party will<br />win the most seats at 58%. After reading about<br />the Canadian snap election process and looking<br />over many polls, I have found that most believe<br />the liberal party is bridging the gap between<br />conservatives after Carney’s campaigning. Canadian<br />polls have had great accuracy in the past, and the<br />Liberal party recently overtook the Conservative<br />party in the polls, so I believe they will get the<br />most.","Margaret Pope (20%): Although Brian Kemp is most<br />likely going to run for the open senate seat in<br />2026, he has said in interviews that he wants<br />to wait until the Georgia legislative session<br />is over. The legislative session ends near the<br />beginning of April, so it is not likely that<br />he will turn around and announce his senatorial<br />campaign that quickly.","Margaret Pope (85%): Georgia Republicans are<br />looking to win the open senate seat in 2026, and<br />Governor Kemp is the most likely candidate to<br />win that seat due to his popularity in Georgia.<br />Also, there is speculation that he is looking to<br />potentially run for president which would make his<br />run for senate beneficial due to the national name<br />recognition and his already established popularity<br />in Georgia.","Margaret Pope (30%): I find it not likely that<br />GPT-5 will be released by April 28. Although CEO<br />Sam Altman has indicated its actively being worked<br />on, it is likely that it is still in its training<br />phase which could take a longer amount of time.<br />GPT-4.5 was released in February, and Altman<br />mentioned GPT-5 would come out in the coming weeks<br />or months, but I do not think it will be published<br />prior to April 28.","Margaret Pope (67%): The liberal party in Canada<br />has gained more traction in the past few months.<br />Their popularity in the polls is slightly higher<br />than the conservatives, so that could indicate<br />that if the snap election is held soon, they could<br />win the most seats. The party leader, Mark Carney,<br />has helped garner more support for the liberal<br />party, especially amidst the potential trade war<br />with the US. It is likely that if the polls hold<br />up, the liberals could win.","Maston Corn (58%): Governor Kemp will most likely<br />announce whether he is running or not for the<br />U.S. Senate election against Jon Ossoff before<br />April 28th as he has mentioned that he will<br />make an announcement regarding his potential run<br />after Georgia's legislative session adjourns on<br />April 4th. Political analysts suggest that he is<br />most likely that candidate that will run for the<br />Republican party because of his position within<br />the party, his popularity, and the fact that<br />he would be a strong contender. However, he has<br />mentioned that he has a lot on his plate currently<br />and that he has made multiple other commitments.","Maston Corn (15%): On February 28th, 2025, OpenAI<br />released GPT 4.5. This version of GPT is the first<br />upgrade for GPT 4 which occurred in March 2023. It<br />has been two years since we have seen an update to<br />the GPT and the last time that a system went from<br />a whole number to .5 was in November 2022 with<br />GPT 3.5. It took OpenAI 4 months until GPT 4 was<br />introduced and considering that GPT 4.5 was just<br />introduced it is highly unlikely that GPT 5 will<br />come out only 2 months after 4.5 was released.","Matthew Newby (35%): I think it is possible<br />governor kemp will announce a senate campaign<br />before April 28th. After doing some research I<br />found he is one of the top candidates in Georgia<br />to run for senate. I believe he will wait a little<br />longer than the end of April to announce his<br />campaign but I do think there is a small chance he<br />does before.","Matthew Newby (0%): I think there is no way gpt<br />5 releases before April 28. The 4.5 version just<br />came out in February and they announced that GPT 5<br />will not be released until later this year. Given<br />the comments about it not being released until<br />later this year I think there is just no chance<br />they release it earlier than they said.","Meera Srinivadan (35%): Governor Brian Kemp is, in<br />the eyes of many, the clear Republican frontrunner<br />for the 2026 Senate race for the seat currently<br />held by Senator Jon Ossoff. Kemp has undeniable<br />popularity in Georgia, among Republicans as well<br />as some Democrats and Independents. If he is<br />to ever run for President, which I believe is<br />possible, winning this Senate seat could put him<br />in a favorable position. However, I do not believe<br />he will choose to run so soon after concluding<br />his term as governor. I believe instead that it<br />is more likely that he takes a short hiatus from<br />elected office before announcing a campaign.","Meera Srinivasan (20%): I do not believe it is<br />likely that Brian Kemp will run for Senate in the<br />first place. With that being said, I do believe it<br />is possible. However, should he run for Senate for<br />the 2026 cycle, I believe he will not announce his<br />candidacy so shortly after the conclusion of the<br />2025 legislative session. Sessions concludes April<br />4, less than a month before April 28.","Meera Srinivasan (40%): OpenAI has not yet<br />announced a release date for GPT-5. There<br />are typically many months between new GPT<br />releases—GPT-3 and GPT-4 had nearly three years<br />between their releases. GPT-4 was released in<br />March of 2023, 24 months ago. Thus, I believe it<br />is slightly less likely than not that GPT-5 will<br />be released before April 28th.","Meera Srinivasan (55%): Due to the ongoing<br />trade war with the United States, I believe that<br />Canadians will allow the Liberal Party to have a<br />majority government and give them the most seats.<br />During times of economic uncertainty, such as this<br />one, Liberals often experience an electoral boost.","Mia Pisani (68%): In a poll by \"The Hill,\" 47%<br />respondents predicted that Governor Kemp will<br />\"probably\" run for Senate, while 28% believe he<br />\"definetly will.\" He has faced a lot of pressure<br />from Republicans to run, as many believe he has<br />a likely chance of beating incumbent Jon Ossoff.<br />However, many people predict he aims to run<br />for President, and if he were to do so, there<br />are pros and cons to working in Congress. Jay<br />Bookman writes \"Kemp might decide that he’s better<br />off campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire as a<br />successful two-term former governor of a critical<br />swing state, a man who is conservative but not<br />crazy, than he would be as a sitting U.S. senator,<br />with the taint of Washington on his clothes.\"<br />Kemp has also stated \"We need to flip that seat.<br />We should have a Republican in that seat, and I<br />believe we'll have one after the '26 election,\"<br />and hypothetical polls show he is the only one<br />able to overtake Ossoff. Kemp also claimed he<br />is not ready to make an announcement about his<br />candidacy, as he has \"a lot on his plate right<br />now,\" leading me to predict the likelihood as<br />slightly lower.","Mia Pisani (15%): OpenAI released GPT-4.5 in<br />late February, and GPT-5 is not predicted to be<br />available until late May. Per the Wall Street<br />Journal, it is costly and is not advanced enough<br />to mitigate these expenses. There are no set<br />criteria for the model to meet, but Sam Altman has<br />explained it will be significantly smarter than<br />previous versions. Since it is expected in May,<br />I believe there is a slight chance GPT-5 may be<br />available in April, but there are several factors<br />that contribute to its low probability. Due to<br />the recent release of GPT-4.5 and the expected<br />advancement from previous models, I do not expect<br />GPT-5 to be released prior to April 28th.","Mia Pisani (68%): Since Prime Minister Carney<br />has taken office, Liberals have gained extensive<br />support. Carney called for a dissolution of<br />parliament, indicating he is confident Liberals<br />will be able to earn a majority of the seats.<br />Tensions between President Trump and Canada have<br />contributed to a favorable shift towards the<br />Liberal party. Trump's attacks against Canada<br />through tariffs and threats has driven voters<br />away from Conservative leaders. I find it very<br />likely this will be demonstrated in the upcoming<br />election.","Milan Yadav (43%): Right now there is a major<br />ongoing battle on tort reform in our state,<br />so while Kemp deals with that I doubt he will<br />announce something so big as a bid for a Senate<br />seat. We do not know how long this tort reform<br />battle will go on for, however, the legislative<br />session ends on April 4th. Kemp has said, \"I know<br />I can't keep holding out forever, so we'll have<br />something to say on that down the road.\" Next<br />year, 36 US states will have governor elections<br />and Kemp has said many things about keeping<br />Republicans in power, maybe hinting at him aiming<br />for another political position? Kemp is popular<br />among many Georgians and have the money and power<br />to make a legit Senate run, so it is likely,<br />especially with 20+ days after the legislative<br />session ends on Apr 4.","Milan Yadav (83%): Ossoff is looking like he will<br />most likely lose his seat, as he is not as popular<br />with fellow Senators (including Dems) and frankly<br />does not seem \"Georgian\" from the surface level.<br />For an average voter, looking at Ossoff many<br />people thought he is from CA or the North. Warnock<br />on the other hand has a very large following,<br />especially in a state of the Bible Belt and large<br />black communities that can relate to his work<br />and life. Therefore, Kemp running against Ossoff<br />will probably be in his favor, especially since<br />moderates and even some dems can relate to him as<br />he has stood up to Trump numerous times before.<br />Also, at the end of the day, Kemp will no longer<br />be in major politics if he does not run for a<br />Senate seat, since his time as governor is up.","Milan Yadav (10%): Currently, we are in the<br />\"Omni\" generation of Chat GPT, and GPT 4.5 was<br />just released about a month ago. The gap between<br />the releases of GPT 3 and GPT 4 was 33 months. On<br />the web, there are numerous reports of a Dec 2025<br />release date for GPT-5. The shortages and shipping<br />of GPU's are also a factor, as thie can delay the<br />release as well. Most reports say GPT 5 is still<br />deep in testing and training.","Milan Yadav (70%): Amidst the current trade<br />\"wars\", many Canadians are looking for a way out.<br />Immigration is a major issue in the country, as<br />well as a massive housing and economic crisis<br />where most average Canadians cannot afford typical<br />things anymore. The main reason why the Liberals<br />will most likely hang on to power is because<br />the incumbent, Carney, is a Liberal. Very recent<br />polls show that the Conservatives have remained<br />stagnated for a while.","Nathaniel Long (29%): Currently, Governor Kemp<br />is speculated to be running for Senate in 2026,<br />especially due to the significant number of<br />Republicans wishing for him to run against John<br />Ossoff. While it is likely he will make the<br />announcement to run in the future, it is unlikely<br />that said announcement will come until later<br />this year. Kemp is currently in the middle of<br />a Legislative Session with Georgia, which will<br />end on April 4th, a date too close to the 28th<br />to effectively craft a Senate announcement. Kemp<br />himself stated that he has \"A lot on his plate<br />right now\" and cannot be focusing on running for<br />Senate with all of his current responsibilities.","Nathaniel Long (83%): Described as one of the<br />GOP's biggest recruits for the Senate race, Kemp<br />is almost certainly going to run for Senate in<br />2026, especially due to the possible vunerability<br />in the position, currently held by John Ossoff<br />(D-GA). Kemp has already expressed an interest<br />in the Senate position, and will likely begin<br />discussion of running after his legislative<br />session ends on April 4th, though his announcement<br />will likely come in the later half of 2025.","Nathaniel Long (40%): In February of this year,<br />OpenAI announced their roadmap and plans for<br />their products GPT-4.5 (codename Orion) and GPT-5,<br />though there was not a confirmed release date for<br />GPT-5. GPT 4.5 released later that month. It is<br />theorized now that GPT-5 will release in mid-2025.<br />There is almost now information on the official<br />release times, though it can be assumed that<br />4.5's release implies 5 is almost complete. It is<br />therefore more likely that GPT-5 will release in<br />May or June, rather than during March or April.","Nathaniel Long (60%): After the rigorous<br />anti-Canada policy that Donald Trump has<br />imposed, the Liberal Party in Canada has risen<br />in popularity significantly, especially under the<br />leadership of the new Prime Minister, Mark Carney.<br />Unionization against Donald Trump's conservative<br />policy significantly boosts the likelihood of the<br />Liberal Party taking a majority in parliament,<br />though said majority would be one of the biggest<br />Canadian political upsets in six years, accounting<br />for the chances being 60% rather than higher%","Niomi Nurse (80%): It is highly likely that Brian<br />Kemp will run for US Senate next year, has he has<br />had much experience with leadership and governance<br />in the state of Georgia. He has also been a proud<br />supporter of President Trump. As a republican<br />governor in the state of Georgia, Kemp would be<br />successful in running for US Senate, and he would<br />have a lot of support from those who voted for him<br />in the past.","Niomi Nurse (80%): It is highly likely that Brian<br />Kemp will run for US Senate next year, has he has<br />had much experience with leadership and governance<br />in the state of Georgia.

The election<br />for these seats is just days away, and many voters<br />favor the Liberal party. Canada is amid a trade<br />war with the United States, and voters are seeking<br />reassurance in the policies that will be put in<br />place.","Pablo Martinez (45%): As of March 19, 2025,<br />Governor Brian Kemp has not announced his<br />candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat currently<br />held by Senator Jon Ossoff, which will be<br />contested in the 2026 election. In a February<br />2025 interview, Kemp acknowledged the importance<br />of the Senate race but indicated he was focused<br />on his responsibilities and his role as chair<br />of the Republican Governors Association. He<br />mentioned that he would make a decision after the<br />conclusion of Georgia’s legislative session, which<br />is scheduled to adjourn on April 4, 2025. Based on<br />this timeline, it is possible that Governor Kemp<br />could announce his decision regarding a Senate run<br />before April 28, 2025.","Pablo Martinez (20%): OpenAI is unlikely to<br />release GPT-5 before April 28, 2025, with an<br />estimated probability of 10-20%. Historical trends<br />show major releases every two to three years,<br />making late 2025 or early 2026 more probable.<br />OpenAI has not announced GPT-5, instead focusing<br />on GPT-4 Turbo improvements. Competitive pressures<br />are not urgent, and regulatory concerns may<br />further delay deployment. While surprises are<br />possible, current evidence strongly suggests GPT-5<br />will not be released before the deadline.","Pablo Martinez (60%): Recent polls indicate that<br />Canada's Liberal Party, led by newly appointed<br />Prime Minister Mark Carney, is poised to win<br />the most seats in the upcoming snap election.<br />An Ipsos poll conducted on March 18, 2025, shows<br />the Liberals at 42% support among decided voters,<br />leading the Conservatives, who stand at 36%. This<br />surge in Liberal support is attributed to Carney's<br />decisive leadership and a strong stance against<br />recent U.S. trade policies under President Donald<br />Trump. The election is expected to be called for<br />April 28, 2025","Quintin Gallardo (30%): At first, I gave this a 0%<br />chance of happening, but after a little research<br />and discovered that he definitely has shown some<br />initiative in regards to holding a more Republican<br />state, despite this revelation, I still hold<br />a large sentence that Brian Kemp would not put<br />himself in a role that diminishes the title that<br />he already holds. Despite the initial hesitancy,<br />Governor campus showed that he has some motivation<br />in running for Senate, but I do not think it is<br />nearly enough, especially with the time constraint<br />for him to announce this semester.","Quintin Gallardo (60%): Despite my hesitancy as<br />to whether or not Kemp will announce a senatorial<br />campaign, I do still believe that there's a chance<br />of him announcing with him the next few months,<br />whether or not he will do it before the end of the<br />semester is another question. When it comes down<br />to it, my main concern was the time constraint,<br />but with the negation of that, I do have faith in<br />his campaign happening.","Quintin Gallardo (15%): With the question of<br />whether or not Chat GPT five would be released<br />by April 28, I decided it was best to ask the<br />source itself. Which gave it a low to improbable<br />prediction. The decision was based off of<br />statements from Open AI’s CEO and prior releases<br />which estimated the release to be in late May or<br />mid 2025. Though I second a lot of the reasoning,<br />it was hard to deny the fact that they pushed up<br />the release of 4.5 and thus I gave it slightly<br />better odds.","Rebecca Mcadam (20%): The most important thing<br />in this question is timing. April would be very<br />early for any candidate to announce a campaign<br />for Senate. Looking at when Warnock and Ossoff<br />announced their candidacy for the 2020 election,<br />it would be much more reasonable for Kemp to<br />announce his campaign later this year or early<br />next year.","Rebecca Mcadam (75%): I think it is very likely<br />that Kemp will run for Senate. He is the only<br />Republican in Georgia with enough experience<br />and popularity to defeat Ossoff, especially<br />since Georgia is so polarized. With his recent<br />endorsement of Trump, Kemp could be trying to win<br />the favor of the Republican party as he prepares<br />to launch a campaign. He is demonstrating his<br />companionship with his own party","Rebecca Mcadam (15%): I think ChatGPT 5 will be<br />announced later in the year. There was a 9 month<br />time period between the release of 4 and 4.5,<br />and since 4.5 was released just a few weeks ago,<br />I believe it will be at least a few more months<br />before version 5 is released. Also, since version<br />4.5 was released so recently, developers will need<br />more than another month and a half to configure a<br />new version.","Rebecca Mcadam (75%): The Liberal party has a 5<br />point lead against the conservatives in terms of<br />voter intentions, which is a significant change. I<br />think Canadians will tend to vote Liberal in this<br />election due to a surge in national identity. This<br />is because of Canadian disdain for Trump and their<br />desire to rally behind the candidates that are<br />anti-Trump.","Riley Batz (25%): Given Kemp’s statements, current<br />timeline, and overall political climate, I find it<br />to be a low probability that Kemp would announce a<br />run for U.S. Senate before April 28th, estimating<br />25%. This deadline is less than a month after the<br />end of Georgia’s Legislative Session. Sine Die<br />for the General Assembly is Friday, April 4th,<br />and Governor Kemp has made it clear that all of<br />his focus currently is on signing his legislative<br />goals into law. All experts agree that Kemp<br />will not make an announcement regarding future<br />candidacy until session is over. An announcement<br />by April 28th leaves only a 3 week gap, which<br />seems too ambitious of a timeline.","Riley Batz (46%): Regarding whether Kemp will run<br />at all, I push this probability to be 46%. Though<br />he is facing intense political pressure to run<br />for Ossoff's seat, I believe there is potential<br />for him to turn to the White House instead and run<br />for President in 2028. Some Kemp allies suggest<br />that not running for President in 2024 was a<br />strategic move that “could put him in a stronger<br />position in the next presidential election cycle<br />— unlike those who entered the race and publicly<br />criticized Trump, before turning around and<br />offering him their endorsements.” Additionally,<br />Kemp's favorability ratings in a purple state are<br />something that national onlookers and big donors<br />are going to keep an eye on for the Presidency,<br />not Senate.","Riley Batz (38%): Open AI's CEO, Sam Altman, has<br />confirmed the creation of GPT-5. At the end of<br />2024, AI Industry experts expected the model to be<br />released in early 2025, which aligns with OpenAI’s<br />typical pattern of releasing major updates<br />approximately every 1-2 years. However, I don't<br />believe it will be released before April 28th<br />because of the work required to make an update,<br />as well as the 4.5 model just being released Feb<br />27th to pro users- 2 months is a quick turnaround.<br />GPT-3 to GPT-4 release took 33 months. 33 months<br />after GPT-4 would be December 2025. I think 2025<br />is probable, but not before May.","Riley Batz (70%): According to CBC News, For the<br />first time in nearly three years, the Liberals<br />are leading in the polls as support for the<br />Conservatives and NDP slides. CBC predicts that<br />the Liberals would have a roughly three-in-four<br />chance of winning the most seats if an election<br />were held today. I believe this is accurate, as<br />Canada is pushing for more liberal representatives<br />to push against Trump. They want to retaliate<br />against the tariffs, and more liberals in<br />Parliament would result in the greatest action.<br />All polling on Wikipedia recorded within the past<br />few days show the Liberals ahead in the polls, and<br />I do not foresee this changing.","Ruby Douglas (25%): It’s unlikely that GPT-5<br />will be released before April 28, 2025, for a<br />few key reasons. First of all, OpenAI has stated<br />that GPT-4.5 (known as \"Orion\") is expected to<br />be released in early 2025. This suggests that<br />GPT-5 would come after GPT-4.5, which implies it<br />won’t be released until at least mid-2025. Orion<br />was released in February which means that GPT-5<br />still has a while to go before being released.<br />Furthermore, there have been several reports on<br />the delays on GPT-5, as OpenAI has been focusing<br />on refining and optimizing GPT-4 and its upcoming<br />4.5 version before fully unveiling GPT-5. This<br />suggests that the timeline for GPT-5’s release<br />might be extended into mid or late 2025.","Ruby Douglas (70%): Recent polling data indicates<br />that Canada’s Liberal Party (LPC), led by<br />Prime Minister Mark Carney, has experienced a<br />significant surge in support ahead of the snap<br />election scheduled for April 28, 2025. This shift<br />is largely attributed to rising nationalistic<br />sentiments in response to recent trade tensions<br />and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald<br />Trump. According to a recent Ipsos poll, if a<br />federal election were held today, the Liberals<br />would receive 38% of decided voter support,<br />compared to 36% for the Conservatives (CPC),<br />marking the first time in years that the Liberals<br />have led in the polls. Similarly, Pallas Data<br />reports that while the Conservatives maintain a<br />substantial but narrowing lead, a Liberal Party<br />led by Mark Carney would win an election if<br />held today. Seat projections from 338 Canada,<br />a statistical model of electoral projections,<br />currently estimate the Liberals at 160 seats<br />(with a range of 125-193) and the Conservatives at<br />139 seats (range of 107-172). This resurgence in<br />Liberal support is largely attributed to President<br />Trump’s recent actions, including threats of<br />annexation and the imposition of punitive tariffs<br />on Canadian goods, which have fueled Canadian<br />nationalism and bolstered the Liberal Party’s<br />standing.","Sarah Joyce (40%): I am pretty uncertain about<br />this prediction, but I feel it is more unlikely<br />that Kemp will announce his run for senate before<br />April 28th, if he does at all. He has not been<br />clear about what his ambitions are, though he has<br />expressed he wants to wait before the legislative<br />session in Georgia is over before making any<br />announcement. Also, he might want to run for<br />president, and although he has polled the best<br />against Ossoff, midterms typically favor the party<br />out of power, so he might want to hold off and run<br />for president rather than go for Senate.","Sarah Joyce (30%): It seems pretty unlikely that<br />GPT-5 will be released before April 28th. Although<br />OpenAI's CEO said that it the release was \"months<br />away\" in a reply post in February, there has been<br />little indication that it would be ready to be<br />dropped by April 28th. Additionally, Polymarket<br />predicts that it is more likely to be released<br />sometime in the middle or later months of the<br />year.","Sarah Joyce (70%): I think it is likely that the<br />Liberal Party will win the most seats. Initially,<br />the Liberal Party was polling really low, due to<br />the unpopularity of Trudeau and the carbon tax,<br />which made the Conservative Party more appealing<br />to voters. However, with a new Prime Minister<br />and the anger at Trump's actions, I think it<br />is more likely that people will vote Liberal.<br />Additionally, Mark Carney deciding to call the<br />election early probably indicates a level of<br />confidence that the Liberal Party can win the<br />majority.","Senait Pirani (60%): Kemp has said he will<br />consider a bid for US Senate after the conclusion<br />of the GA legislative session, which concludes<br />on April 4th. I think 3 weeks is enough time to<br />consider announcing a bid, but he may decide to<br />wait longer. I think it is more likely than not<br />he will end up running, with the only issue being<br />timing.","Senait Pirani (88%): I think there is a strong<br />chance that Kemp will announce a bid for US<br />Senate. Polls show him doing well against Ossoff,<br />and he has a fairly decent reputation as governor.<br />He has also hinted towards a run for Senate when<br />asked about it, but has said a decision will come<br />after the conclusion of the legislative session.","Sreya Pandyaram (46%): It is known that Georgia's<br />legislative session is scheduled to end on April<br />4, this may motivate Brian Kemp to make his plans<br />known for the senate before April 28. However<br />there is no updates or news about the governor's<br />mindset. In many ways it is clear that he is an<br />extremely strong candidate, but his focus for now<br />remains on his current duties. Kemp has states<br />that any notice of his future will come down the<br />road, and therefore after the legislation session<br />ends, there could be a notice. Instinctually<br />I feel that the governor does want to run for<br />the senate, but his clashes with Trump may sway<br />his decisions. I am also not sure that he will<br />announce by the 28th. There is also the idea that<br />he may want to strategize as he is a contender<br />for the 2028 presidential election as well, and<br />may want to scope the ever-changing political<br />landscape.","Sreya Pandyaram (26%): The probability is somewhat<br />unlikely because OpenAI recently introduced a<br />product in Feburary. Looking at the pattern of<br />OpenAI releases, there is usually at least a<br />couple month period, most of it ranging between<br />a year to a year and half. However the release<br />of more products from competitors may prompt the<br />company to release quicker than previous times .<br />Therefore it can be looked at in two ways, one<br />way is that the release of rival products may<br />motivate OpenAi to ,restate, release quicker. Or<br />it may stall, since the next advancement needs to<br />have better improvements that are not just minor<br />benefits. Therefore it could happen in 2025, just<br />not within two months.","Sreya Pandyaram (76%): Recent articles have<br />suggested a revival in Canada's liberal party due<br />to Trump, Carney seems very favored. Therefore,<br />the Liberal party may win the snap election.<br />However wining the election doesn't automatically<br />translate to the most seats won. As the 2019<br />election demonstrates, Trudeau won but did not win<br />the most seats. However this was with a 33% of the<br />vote. Polls predict that the liberal party ,today,<br />could win 41% of the vote, since nationalism is<br />now a common and heavily favored theme, this is<br />also in stark contrast to the conservatives with<br />29%. Therefore, if the polling holds the Liberal<br />party could win with a majority. Really it all<br />comes down to Ontario, Quebec, and the prairies<br />to prevent a minority government. CBC reports<br />that Carney is heavily favored in Quebec, however<br />me must maintain this impression which is more<br />difficult.","Teya Hagy (30%): I do not think that Governor<br />Kemp will announce to run for US Senate before<br />April 28th. He made a statement about this<br />subject saying \"I can't hold out on this forever\".<br />But stated his prior commitments and how time<br />consuming that those were. I believe that if he<br />wanted to he would have announced it by now.","Teya Hagy (35%): I do not believe that OpenAI<br />will release GPT-5 before April 28th. A lot of<br />my research is saying that it will be available<br />late May and not before that. I am hesitant that<br />they will come out with an earlier release date<br />soon, however they are not that far along on a new<br />product and are having difficulties.","Thomas Smith (25%): I find it unlikely Brian<br />Kemp, if he were to run, announce his candidacy<br />so soon after the general assembly adjourns. It<br />is still very early for a candidate to announce<br />their intention to run as the race is still quite<br />far away. However I could see it happen due to the<br />primary on the republican side most likely being a<br />very contested battle.","Thomas Smith (35%): I think it’s entirely possible<br />we get an announcement regarding the release of<br />chat GPT-5 by April 28th but I am doubtful the<br />full product will be released by then. Right now<br />it is all speculation about the release of the<br />product being mid-2025, nothing from Sam Altman<br />himself.","Thomas Smith (62%): With Carney assuming control<br />of the Liberal Party and as well the prime<br />ministership the party has been given a new life<br />and this has been reflected in the polls. The<br />Conservative Party led by Pierre Poilievre have<br />seem to start to plateau in support after leading<br />in the polls for months. Trudeau’s resignation<br />and the Trump administrations outgoing hostility’s<br />towards Canada have made the Liberal Party come<br />back from the dead almost.","Tiyanah Rowtham (10%): I think the chances of<br />OpenAI releasing a product called GPT5 by April<br />28 is pretty low because they just released GPT<br />4.5 on February 27, 2025. The CEO stated that they<br />will release an updated version within months of<br />the initial release but I think April 28 would be<br />too soon.","Tiyanah Rowtham (63%): Whether the liberal party<br />will gain the most seats in Parliament in Canada's<br />snap election is a very nuances and complicated<br />topic. The Trump administrations threats and trade<br />tensions have bolstered support for the Liberals.<br />On the other hand, Canadian nationalism is on the<br />rise and Conservatives were previously heavily<br />favored to win.","Townsend Turner (16%): Almost no one announces a<br />Senate race this early in the process, especially<br />considering he is still serving as governor. To<br />that end, using Jon Ossoff as an example, he did<br />not announce his Senate run until the September of<br />the year before. Notwithstanding that I think Kemp<br />will run for Senate, he shouldn’t announce his<br />run so early as he runs the risk of running out of<br />steam before Election Day. Also, there is not much<br />more than a month between now and April 28 so the<br />odds are a bit lower.","Townsend Turner (83%): This is the next logical<br />step for Kemp. He is a hugely popular figure in<br />his state with an opportunity to flip a crucial<br />Senate seat. Furthermore, he looks to have a lot<br />of Republican support in the wake of what might be<br />a very turbulent and fragile Trump presidency as<br />a result of his lack of MAGA kowtowing. Finally,<br />I doubt he runs for president as he is not a very<br />tantalizing figure outside of the South; he’s not<br />perceived as anything more than a short, country<br />Southern politician.","Townsend Turner (38%): I think based on all that<br />I’ve read that GPT-5 is essentially ready to be<br />released, and that it’s just a timing question.<br />I am most convinced that it will drop in May, as<br />OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft makes their<br />developer conference on May 22nd the most likely<br />release setup. However, the amount of time between<br />now and April 28th gives more enough time for a<br />product that looks to be already virtually ready<br />for release, which explains the relatively high<br />projection.","Tristan Thompson (57%): Governor Brian Kemp has<br />shown interest in running for senate against John<br />Ossoff in the upcoming 2026 senate race. According<br />to Kemp, he is not moving forward with announcing<br />his running currently due to Georgia’s legislative<br />session taking up much of his time. I believe that<br />there is a slight to fair chance that Governor<br />Kemp announces his race after this adjournment on<br />April 4th.","Tristan Thompson (57%): Governor Brian Kemp is<br />currently a front-runner for the Georgia Senate<br />race against John Ossoff in 2026. Current polls<br />even have him at a slight advantage over Ossoff.<br />I believe that he has the best interest of the<br />Republican Party in mind, and if he will be more<br />impactful as a senator than a governor he will<br />definitely consider running for senate.","Tristan Thompson (39%): The time taken between<br />the release of GPT 3 and 4 was 33 months, these<br />systems take lots of time to code and develop,<br />and OpenAI is going to want to release a product<br />that is advanced enough to compete with their<br />competitor DeepSeek, so I do not believe that GPT<br />5 will be released by April 28th.","Tristan Thompson (58%): Oftentimes in elections,<br />a resurgence of support for the losing party is<br />seen, this seems to be the case for the Canadian<br />liberal party. Current opinion polls have the<br />Liberal Party leading the Conservatives by two<br />percentage points, as it stands right now, I<br />could see liberals gaining a majority of seats.<br />However, I leave the prediction close to 50/50 due<br />to polling predictions and actual voter turnout<br />sometimes not having much correlation.","Vangeli Tsiaras (1%): Governor Kemp announcing a<br />Senatorial run before April 28th seems extremely<br />unlikely to me. It seems too soon for Kemp as<br />he has made no real indication or announced any<br />intent to run for the seat. It is also very early,<br />if he announced it before April, it would mean<br />he would be doing so a year and a half before the<br />election, which is very untypical, especially for<br />someone to not even hint at it yet.","Vangeli Tsiaras (25%): OpenAI's release of their<br />GPT-5 product has been largely unknown when<br />it will happen. Their most recent release was<br />GPT-4.5, which came out on February 27th. I think<br />it is too soon for the GPT-5 to be released for<br />many factors, including the very recent release<br />of GPT-4.5, multiple sources claiming or betting<br />it will be released on dates after the 28th, and<br />OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hinting in late February on<br />Twitter that it is \"months away.\"","Vangeli Tsiaras (55%): Since Donald Trump's<br />victory in the 2024 U.S. Presidential election and<br />his announcement of tariffs on Canada, politics<br />has greatly changed Canada. Under Trudeau's<br />leadership, The Conservative party was the clear<br />favorite to win the most seats in their 2025<br />election, but now things look different. Opinion<br />polls are now showing the Liberal Party back ahead<br />under the new leadership of Mark Carney. Under new<br />leadership, I think the Liberal Party will have<br />a slight advantage over the Conservative Party in<br />snap elections.","Wyatt Dasher (60%): I know people who are heavily<br />involved in the kemp family and politics. He is<br />running but this is a quick turn around. I think<br />it is more likely because it makes sense to me<br />that he would announce while being governor. He<br />is extremely popular in the state and if he runs I<br />think he will win","Wyatt Dasher (70%): I have it on good knowledge<br />that he is going to run. Yet it is hard to know<br />for 100% because while he has taken the steps to<br />run he can always go back. He is focused on being<br />governor and while he has taken the right steps<br />to run. Until he says the words publicly it's not<br />guaranteed.","Wyatt Dasher (25%): Sources say that ChatGPT 5<br />may come out within weeks or months. But with<br />Microsoft’s build conference in May it seems<br />unlikely that they would risk a big announcement<br />at that event overshadow ChatGPT big announcement.<br />Also it was February 28th when the ceo came out<br />and said it would be months before chat gpt 5 came<br />out.","Wyatt Dasher (75%): Putting all this data together<br />to make a sound prediction is easier said than<br />done. Starting with the group think polls. I am<br />sitting at 92% likely that the liberals win the<br />most seats. Then using my inside information of<br />the politics between trump and Canada plus the<br />seat distribution my odds drop closer to 87%. Then<br />considering make up of Ontario and what Ford has<br />said about the elections and what his constitutes<br />want; I put the odds at about 80. This is based<br />off what Ford has said about trump and some of<br />the recent policies that Ford has put in place.<br />Ford has been seen wearing a blue hat that states<br />“Canada is not your state”. Then looking the<br />ability for seat change in the parliament based<br />off historical ability to change. My prediction<br />lowers again to 75%. So my final prediction<br />that the liberal party wins the most about of<br />seats in Canadas snap election is 75% certain.<br />This is based off polls, inside information, and<br />historical context.","Wyatt Stevenson (15%): Governor Kemp has briefly<br />mentioned the importance of the upcoming Senate<br />election happening in 2026; however, he has<br />prioritized his current role as Governor and made<br />it clear that is what he wants to focus on in<br />the meantime. Will he think about running for US<br />senator in the future? Probably, but with it being<br />a year until he has to consider running for US<br />senator, I doubt he officially announces running<br />before April 28.","Wyatt Stevenson (22%): There has not been any<br />sort of news regarding a release date for GPT-5.<br />GPT 4.5 did come out at the end of February.<br />GPT-5 was said to be released months after GPT<br />4.5; however, there has not been any sort of<br />confirmation in that. GPT 4.5's purpose to be<br />quicker in performance, GPT-5 has many functions<br />but a few highlights include speed and efficiency<br />in decision making and debugging. While these<br />functions of GPT-5 sound promising, I think it<br />will take time to release this version of AI.","Wyatt Stevenson (60%): The liberal party holds<br />a bit of a lead over the conservative party in<br />the Parliament federal election. Majority of<br />the reason for liberal party support comes from<br />the actions that Donald Trump has made in terms<br />of trades and annexation threats. The Canadian<br />people want to hold their ground legislatively,<br />and majority of them believe the liberal party<br />can maintain the power they hold. However, both<br />parties have a chance in gaining more seats in<br />parliament.","James Martin (5%): I think there is a 5%<br />probability that OpenAI will release a product<br />called GPT-5 before April 28. According to the<br />latest information about this, on February 2025<br />they announced that GPT 4.5 will be released next<br />followed by GPT5 later in the year. Since the 4.5<br />version has not dropped yet, it is very unlikely<br />that GPT 5 will be released by April.","James Martin (60%): I think there is a 60%<br />probability that the Liberal Party will win<br />the most seats in Parliament in Canada's snap<br />election. Recently, the conservatives have been<br />ahead but quickly declining because of Carney's<br />stance against president Donald Trump. Many<br />Canadian's agree with the stance given they are<br />worried about the trade wars with US. However, the<br />election is still very close and will depend on<br />the upcoming campaigns in the next few weeks.","Ruby Douglas (65%): Kemp is a popular Republican<br />figure in Georgia with high approval ratings,<br />especially after his 2022 gubernatorial<br />reelection. His reputation as a strong,<br />independent leader could make him a formidable<br />candidate against Jon Ossoff in 2026. National<br />Republican Support: The GOP leadership is<br />reportedly encouraging Kemp to run, believing<br />he has the best chance of flipping a crucial<br />Senate seat from blue and red. Appeal to Moderate<br />Voters: Kemp has shown he can win over suburban<br />and moderate voters, which would be essential<br />in a statewide Senate race. Georgia governors<br />are limited to two consecutive terms. Since Kemp<br />is already serving his second term, a Senate<br />seat would be a logical next step for continued<br />political influence."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":145.38812785388131},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,4.5999999999999996],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Governor Kemp run<br />for US Senate in 2026?","Will Governor Kemp<br />announce a run for US<br />Senate before April 28?","Will OpenAI release a<br />product called GPT-5<br />before April 28?","Will the Liberal Party<br />win the most seats in<br />Parliament in Canada's<br />snap election?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3,4],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Governor Kemp run<br />for US Senate in 2026?","Will Governor Kemp<br />announce a run for US<br />Senate before April 28?","Will OpenAI release a<br />product called GPT-5<br />before April 28?","Will the Liberal Party<br />win the most seats in<br />Parliament in Canada's<br />snap election?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"44c465717dcb":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"44c42cf15a8f":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"44c465717dcb","visdat":{"44c465717dcb":["function (y) ","x"],"44c42cf15a8f":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

With a Republican majority<br />it’s very much possible for them to vote in favor<br />of it.","Addisen Kameron (93%): I feel in my heart 100%<br />certain these will be passed BUT I feel like<br />I have to be missing something. From what I’ve<br />seen, SB68 has already passed both and Kemp will<br />sign it. SB 74 passed on partisan lines in the<br />senate and I see no reason why it wouldn’t do<br />the same in the House. HB 340 passed bipartisanly<br />in the House and it’ll probably do the same in<br />the Senate. However, I just feel like I have to<br />be underestimating the timing or the priorities<br />or something because this seems too easy and im<br />worried","Andreas Papandreou (72%): Governor Kemp is<br />incredibly active in his current legislative<br />battles to pass the bills mentioned within the<br />question. With Republicans in control of both<br />chambers and with the support of the Republican<br />governor I think there is a high likelihood that<br />all three of these bills pass. There is a chance<br />one fails due to the legislative session ending<br />in early April, but the signs point to all three<br />passing.","Andy Wyatt (37%): Tort reform has already been<br />passed by the General Assembly. SB 74 and HB 340<br />offer more complicated pictures. Both have passed<br />at least one chamber, but need to pass the other<br />chamber before the end of the legislative session.<br />HB 340 has the better chance because it won<br />bipartisan support on a House vote, but it may not<br />be a priority for the Senate to pass by the end<br />of this session. SB 74 passed on a party line vote<br />in the Senate and is a very conservative piece<br />of legislation. As a general matter, the Georgia<br />House is much less conservative than the Senate,<br />and SB 74 has a strong chance of not receiving a<br />House floor vote by the end of session.","Anna Rachwalski (86%): Tort reform has already<br />been passed–so we're 33% there. The other two<br />bills appear very popular among Republicans, but<br />not popular enough to say they'll 100% pass the<br />other chamber that they haven't passed yet. I'd<br />give them each a 4/5 chance of passing, which gets<br />me to my final prediction of 86% for all 3 bills.","Archita Gaur (37%): SB 68 just passed the Senate<br />on the 21st and Kemp will sign it into law. The<br />other two bill shave not yet passed both houses so<br />they could either pass or not. The HB 340 seems a<br />little more unlikely to pass and that is why I put<br />this prediction at 37%. It still has to go through<br />the committee before it can come to a floor vote.<br />SB74 has already","Ava Herring (60%): I think that the chances of<br />this happening are reasonably high. The tort<br />reform bill has a very high chance of being<br />signed just because it has already passed through<br />2 chambers of the Georgia General Assembly. I<br />believe that the other two bills have a moderate<br />chance of being passed, maybe around 50-60%<br />chance. Based on this, I think that there is a<br />pretty moderate chance of all 3 being signed.","Bailey Mattox (32%): From what I am seeing online,<br />out of these three bills, the least likely to<br />pass is SB 74 which deals with explicit materials<br />in libraries. I would give this bill maybe a<br />30-40% chance of being able to be passed before<br />April 4th. While it could be fast tracked, it's<br />controversial and hasn't left committee yet and<br />the House might make changes which then means it<br />has to go back to the Senate. The other two bills<br />have a pretty high probability of passing, but<br />I'll take a little off of my 30-40% estimation<br />since all 3 have to pass for this to resolve as<br />yes.","Benjamin Jacobstein (53%): Given the controversial<br />nature of the Senate bill regarding permissible<br />content in school libraries, it’s likely this bill<br />could prevent the overall question from resolving<br />yes. But the other bills are more likely to pass,<br />especially SB 68, as it awaiting signing by brian<br />kemp.","Bennie Trujillano (60%): SB 68 has already made<br />it though both houses, while SB 74 has passed in<br />the Senate and HB 340 has passed in the house.<br />They will absolutely come to a decision by the<br />end of the session on April 4th but whether both<br />SB 74 and HB 340 will be passed completely is<br />still unclear. However, considering these bills<br />are Republican introduced and there is currently a<br />substantial conservative majority in each body, I<br />would not be surprised if both are passed.","Chinelo Ireh (67%): I believe there is a slight<br />chance that all three of these bills could end<br />up out of both chambers of the Georgia General<br />Assembly. Tort reform is one of Kemp's legislative<br />priorities of this session so he has spearheaded<br />the legislation for it. I also think that the<br />ban on cellphones in the classroom for K-8 could<br />also pass through the House because there was<br />little resistance. However, SB 74 might face more<br />resistance because of its controversial but I<br />still think that the Republican majority will get<br />it passed through the House.","Chloe Cooper (88%): For this question to resolve<br />as yes, all three only need to pass through the<br />Georgia House and the Georgia Senate, and its<br />looking like this is going to happen. SB 68 has<br />already passed through both chambers, SB 74 has<br />passed through the Senate and is being reviewed by<br />the House, and HB 340 has been passed by the House<br />and recently passed a Senate committee. Admittedly<br />I did not find a lot of information on these or<br />how people are planning on voting on them but it<br />seems like a lot of the Republicans want these<br />passed and theres not much stopping them from<br />doing so. I think the main issue here is whether<br />or not they will end up getting passed in time<br />for the April 4th deadline. HB 340 has a hearing<br />scheduled for the 25th and it seems like these two<br />will be decently prioritized when it comes down<br />to it. Might end up coming down to the final day<br />though so could be exciting.","Christian Barr (52%): The difficulties of<br />implementing a state-wide strategy and worries<br />about technological fairness dampen passion<br />for school, even though empirical data suggests<br />less distractions. Conservatively, In spite of<br />all things taken into account, My forecasting<br />prediction gives HB 340 a good 67% probability<br />of passing while taking into account local<br />rules as well as issues with implementation<br />and usefulness. ​​To recap, my reasoning for the<br />decision of SB 68 came about as a result of<br />its close connection with conservative economic<br />policies and prior historical knowledge in related<br />political situations. Due to the lack of clarity<br />of what constitutes explicit content and cultural<br />awareness, my SB 74's estimate is just 30%. A mix<br />between worries about state-wide applicability<br />and implementation issues accounts for HB 340's<br />moderate likelihood of 60%.","Da In Song (10%): I find it highly unlikely for<br />the cell phone ban to pass. It hasn't been an<br />year since the Apalachee High School shooting,<br />and the proposal bans all forms of access to the<br />\"internet and transmission of data\", according to<br />the document. This will find much pushback among<br />the parents who wish to remain in contact with<br />their children during class or after class. This<br />is further jeopardized by the fact that it targets<br />all public middle and elementary schools, to which<br />private schools are left out of. This will raise<br />questions of equality, and whether the department<br />of education will have the capacity to \"provide<br />guidance and technical assistance\" by then, after<br />what Trump does what he does, is questionable.","Diane Johnson (67%): As of right now, SB 68<br />has already passed the House and the Senate and<br />because of Kemp’s strong Republican beliefs it<br />will likely be made into a law raising the total<br />likeliness. SB74 and HB340 are more controversial,<br />with a different branch waiting to pass each one,<br />but it seems like HB 340 will also pass because of<br />the large margin of 143 in favor and 29 against.<br />However, I do not think that SB74 will pass<br />because the margin of 33-21 vote is not a large<br />majority and since the House is so much bigger,<br />I think that it will be more difficult to get a<br />majority.","Eli Henderson (39%): GA SB68 and HB 340 will<br />mostly likely be approved by both bodies of the<br />Georgia legislature because of their popularity<br />and the fact that they passed in either the<br />House or Senate already. The greatest challenge<br />arises with SB74, as it is wildly unpopular and<br />is split amongst party lines. Despite it passing<br />the Senate, i don't foresee all three bills to be<br />adopted by the legislature.","Elliana Williams (35%): As the Georgia Legislative<br />session comes to a close, it is hard for me to<br />believe that all three of the above bills will be<br />passed. I do see Tort Reform making it through,<br />as Kemp endorses it and it seems to not be super<br />controversial in articles I have read. However,<br />I do not think that we will see SB 74 making<br />it through, as it seems to be controversial and<br />not explicit enough for people who oppose it<br />to vote for it. A news article I read made such<br />a good point that I think will dictate alot of<br />legislators rationale, that putting a librarian<br />in jail is a huge political statement that the<br />US/Georgia should not make. Finally, I think<br />that there is a very small chance that the HB 340<br />passes, because of the school shooting in GA last<br />year. People want their children to access their<br />cell phones at school, and I believe that it will<br />not be viewed as reasonable.","Emma Allen (77%): SB 68 has successfully passed<br />both chambers of the Georgia General Assembly very<br />recently. SB 74 and HB 340 are progressing through<br />the legislative process but have not yet been<br />enacted. SB 74 passed the Senate and HB 340 passed<br />in the House in early March. The legislative<br />session ends April 4. It’s very likely SB 74 will<br />pass the Republican controlled House as it is<br />predominantly a republican bill. Additionally, the<br />Georgia State Senate is controlled by Republicans<br />so I also find it very likely HB 340 is passed as<br />it also has Republican roots.","Emma Pastor (30%): Given that these Bills appear<br />to be the center of contentious debate, and have<br />been for weeks, in the Georgia legislative body,<br />I do not foresee all three of these pieces of<br />legislation passing in the next two weeks. Though<br />they have begun moving through the process, bills<br />like the Tort Reform bill have received lots<br />of pushback from survivors of violent crimes,<br />the phone bill has seen pushback from parents<br />concerned about emergency situations such as<br />school shootings, and the explicit materials<br />and libraries has raised concern over criminal<br />penalties for librarians. While one or two of<br />these may pass before the end of this legislative<br />session, I find it unlikely that all three will.","Emma Peterson (15%): I said 15% because the only<br />bill that has passed in both the house and the<br />senate is SB 68. Where it now sits waiting for<br />Kemp to sign it into legislation, SB 74 has not<br />passed in the house and HB 340 has not passed<br />in the senate. Also, given the time frame of the<br />legislation process finishing up on April 4th, it<br />doesn't seem likely all three will pass by then.","Ethan Marcum (40%): I don’t think phone banning<br />would be a good look due to a recent school<br />shooting. It would not be a good look to be honest<br />and I don’t think the government would pass that.<br />If they do it might pass after the semester, but I<br />don’t think it would make sense for that specific<br />bill to pass.","Grace Mccann (62%): The Tort reform bill has<br />already passed in the house and senate. The only<br />thing that its waiting on its Kemps signature who<br />has already expressed his support for the bill.<br />SB 74 is the most controversial bill on this list<br />however it has already passed in the senate. HB<br />340 has already passed the house and is likely<br />to pass the senate because of it aligning with<br />current","Grace Reichelderfer (84%): Georgia SB 68 (Tort<br />Reform) was passed last week, so it comes down<br />to the other two bills. SB 74 (Explicit Materials<br />in Libraries) has already been passed by the<br />Senate. Therefore, it is up to the republican<br />controlled house to pass this republican backed<br />bill. It seems likely that it will pass. SB 74<br />passed with a vote of 32-23 in the Senate, which<br />indicates that it will also pass in the House. HB<br />340 (School Cellphone Ban) has already passed on<br />the House, but is waiting on the Senate. I believe<br />this bill will pass as well, having already passed<br />in the Senate.","Hampton Barrineau (89%): From my research, the<br />first two of the bills have already passed, each<br />through party line votes, and the last bill is<br />by far the least controversial. Not only are<br />their lobbyists for the phone proposal but many<br />educators are in support of it, plus Republicans<br />in general seem aligned with the bill. All three<br />are expected to pass.","Hannah Carson (41%): I believe the tort reform<br />will pass. It is already passed by both chambers<br />and is just waiting for the Governor's signature.<br />Although less certain, I also believe the<br />high school cell phone bill will pass. It has<br />bipartisan backing and has already been passed by<br />the House, only the Senate remains. The explicit<br />material in libraries bill is less certain<br />however. It passed in the Senate but still needs<br />a House vote. This bill is more controversial as<br />there is a lot of questions about what constitutes<br />explicit material. I believe this bill is very<br />possible to pass but has about a 50/50 chance. The<br />50% chance combined with the slim chance that the<br />other 2 bills won't pass gave me a 41% probability<br />that all of these bills will pass before the end<br />of the legislative session.","Isaac Fleischer (56%): Many states have already<br />begun taking steps to limit the phone usage<br />among students. Bills and Georgia have already<br />progressed to the state senate and seem to have<br />lots of support. However, this legislation can be<br />viewed as extreme by some, thus lowering overall<br />support. That being said, the current proposed<br />laws only regulates phone usage in public primary<br />and middle schools. This means that these bills<br />are not too extreme.","Isabella Molina (40%): This one is complicated<br />since these are separate bills. As a whole, if the<br />question is asking whether all of these bills will<br />be passed, I would say no. However, separately,<br />I do think two of the three bills will be passed,<br />while the third bill is a 50/50 chance. SB 68 will<br />be passed because it has already been approved<br />by both the Georgia House and Senate and now<br />awaits Governor Brian Kemp's signature to become<br />law. SB 74 will likely pass since it cleared the<br />Senate with a 32-23 vote and is currently under<br />consideration. The final bill, HB 340, passed the<br />House, but there has been no clear indication of<br />the Senate's position on it.","Jacob Weiss (95%): Two of these bills sb 74 and<br />sb 68 have already reached the goal. Hb 340 is<br />being moved to the Georgia state Senate with<br />a Republican trifecta and the other two bills<br />already passing I see no reason why Hb 340 won't<br />pass. Governor Kemp is also in his last term so he<br />wants to end on good note.","Jake Garrard (20%): All 3 of these bills are quite<br />controversial. Although, the republicans control<br />both sides of the legislation and the governors<br />office, these bills will not be easily passed<br />due to party control. It is hard to imagine that<br />at least one of these bills is not killed in the<br />process through both the house and senate.","Jenny Qiu (40%): SB 68 has been passed by both<br />the House and Senate, HB 340 has been passed by<br />the House, while SB 74 has been passed by the<br />Senate. Since the government is in a trifecta and<br />all three bills are partisan bills (Republican),<br />Republicans can pass the bills if they vote<br />in unity. HB 340 is Senate Committee Favorably<br />Reported (on 03/20) so it is likely to pass. SB<br />74 is controversial due to the ambiguity of the<br />word \"harmful\" for books that are to be moved from<br />libraries and some argue it is not constitutional.<br />Thus, I think it's more likely for SB 74 to not be<br />decided on during this session but introduced in<br />the next session.","Jerusalem Greenberg (30%): SB 68 has it in the<br />bag. Not only is it backed by Brian Kemp, but<br />it's already gone through the House. However,<br />both SB 78 and HB 340 are incredibly unpopular.<br />Similar bills to SB 78 have been struck down as<br />unconstitutional in other states like Arkansas,<br />and I don't think the legislative body is very<br />enthusiastic about being called out for something<br />like that. But what do I know?","Jessy Lee (5%): SB 68, Tort reform, has already<br />passed both house and senate while SB 74, Explicit<br />Materials in Libraries and HB 340, School Cell<br />Phone Ban, have not. SB 74 and HB 340 have<br />decelerated in their process of being passed and I<br />do not believe it is as prevalent as other bills.<br />The end of the legislation is too close for all of<br />these bills to be passed before the end of it. SB<br />74 and HB 340 still would need to pass the house<br />and go through conference committee and enter<br />final approval","Joshua Kang (49%): For Sb 68, it is all but<br />completely certain it will pass, with it already<br />being passed in the legislature, and only needing<br />Kemp to sign off on it. Considering Kemp's support<br />for the bill and its passing as soon as possible,<br />it is all but a done deal. For SB 74, it is<br />possible it will face some opposition, but it is<br />a Republican-controlled legislature, so it has<br />a likely chance of passing. For HB 340, it has a<br />good chance of facing delays due to delays in the<br />Senate. All three bills passing before April 28 is<br />certainly possible, but faces some roadblocks.","Julia Loggins (77%): Currently, SB 68 has passed<br />both chambers with SB 74 having passed the Senate.<br />SB 74 is currently awaiting House committee<br />approval but is likely to pass with a hearing<br />scheduled for March 25. In regards to HB 340, it<br />has passed in the House and is waiting for the<br />Senate vote, already clearing major hurdles. Since<br />all of these have shown strong support in either<br />the House and/or Senate, I believe there is a<br />strong possibility that all three bills will pass<br />both chambers by April 28.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (44%): I believe that the<br />likelihood of all three bills passing is going to<br />be a challenge. SB 74 must still pass the house<br />and HB 340 is now under consideration in the<br />Senate. I believe that the cell phone ban will<br />not pass because there are too many logistical<br />concerns while the other two will pass.","Kyle Smith (65%): I believe that these will all be<br />passed as SB 68 has already passed both chambers<br />so all that is needed is the signature from<br />Governor Kemp. I give that a 90% chance if it is<br />passed and about a 60% chance for SB 74 due to the<br />similar bills in the past being passed as well.<br />As for HB 340 I don't see a very high chance that<br />it is passed but there are already 19 states that<br />have restrictions on cell phone use in school so i<br />do not see it being improbable.","Lawton Smith (85%): SB 68 has already successfully<br />completed the legislative process and now awaits<br />only the Governor's signature to become law.<br />While SB 74 I am uncertain about , the facts are<br />that the bill's partisan nature (Republican 17-0<br />sponsorship) suggests it has strong support from<br />the Republican majority but may face unified<br />Democratic opposition. And then HB 340 has passed<br />the House of Representatives and received approval<br />from a Senate committee on a 4-1 vote.","Levi Thomas (35%): Though there are high<br />Republican majorities that make bill passage<br />easier in the Georgia Legislature, SB 74 is still<br />in committee in the House. The specifics of the<br />bill need to be worked out in terms of how severe<br />the sentencing should be for breaking the law of<br />that bill. If any were to end up not passing, it<br />would likely be HB 74.","Lillie Puhrmann (76%): SB 68 has passed<br />through both chambers and is now waiting for<br />the governor's signature, which seems likely<br />considering his previous support for similar laws.<br />SB 74 has made it through the Senate and is now<br />being reviewed by a House committee, where there<br />are ongoing discussions about how it will affect<br />libraries. HB 340 is gaining traction after its<br />passage in the House and is now being considered<br />by the Senate, with support from advocates who<br />aim to enhance classroom focus and minimize<br />distractions for students.","Mabry Cartwright (20%): I am placing the<br />probability for this question very low. The SB<br />68 Tort Reform bill is likely to be passed and is<br />currently waiting for action from Governor Kemp.<br />However, SB 74 and HB 340 are more controversial.<br />Many claim that SB 74 would be too difficult to<br />enforce due to the sheer number of books in a<br />library. HB 340 is also incredibly controversial<br />because it would prevent the use of cell phones<br />K-8th grade which would also be difficult to<br />enforce. Also, the deadline for these bills is<br />less than a week ago, so at least one of these<br />will probably not be passed.","Margaret Pope (67%): Georgia SB 68 has already<br />passed the senate making this question slightly<br />more plausible. Senator Max Burns is championing<br />SB 74, which has a chance to pass the senate. It<br />has been sent to the rules committee which means<br />it will likely be voted on prior to the end of the<br />session. Similarly, HB 340 could be passed, but it<br />has not made it as far as SB 74.","Maston Corn (64%): Georgia SB 68 has already<br />passed both House and Senate so that outcome of<br />this forecast will be determined by SB 74 and<br />HB 340. SB 74 has currently passed Senate and<br />is currently under consideration in the House<br />and with the Republican majority in the House,<br />it is likely that this piece of legislation will<br />be approved and sent to Governor Kemp for his<br />signature. HB 340 is likely to be voted on the<br />Senate floor before the session ends on March 28th<br />and it has already passed the House and a Senate<br />Committee. However, SB 74 is scheduled for a<br />hearing on March 25th for the House Committee and<br />with this short timeline it could be brought to<br />the floor before the end of session, but it will<br />have to be a very quick turnaround. The Democrats<br />could try to delay this piece of legislation<br />to the end of session so that the bill never<br />gets voted on. I believe that these pieces of<br />legislation will get passed and that the momentum<br />that they currently have will allow them to be<br />passed before the end of session.","Matthew Newby (20%): I do not think it is likely<br />that these will pass by the end of the legislative<br />session. From what I have researches these have<br />been up for debate for some time and I dont think<br />it is likely that they will pass by the time the<br />legislative session is over.","Meera Srinivasan (35%): For this question to<br />resolve as yes, all three measures would have<br />to pass. I believe there is an extremely strong<br />likelihood that tort reform passes, given<br />the Governor’s emphasis. I believe there is a<br />stronger than 1 in 4 chance that HB 340 will pass,<br />depending on the Senate’s priorities. Most of my<br />confusion lies with SB 74. I believe the odds of<br />SB 74 passing largely depend on information I am<br />not privy to, such as the Speaker’s priorities for<br />the biennial session as a whole, internal support<br />among House Republicans, and the likelihood of<br />a revival. However, given the high possibility<br />of state Republicans tabling either HB 340 or<br />SB 74 for next year—especially given that it is<br />an election year—I believe the likelihood of all<br />three bills passing is somewhat low.","Mia Pisani (74%): Georgia SB 68 has already<br />passed in the House and Senate, leaving SB 74<br />and HB 340 left to be resolved. SB 74 is highly<br />controversial, as a similar law has been struck<br />down in Arkansas. It has already passed in<br />the Senate in a 32-23 vote. Due to Republican<br />dominance, I find it likely it will also pass in<br />the House. HB 340 has passed in the House and a<br />Senate committee. Six states have passed bills<br />banning cell phones in schools, regardless of the<br />dominant party, leading me to believe Georgia will<br />follow suit without issue.","Milan Yadav (75%): SB 68 is already on Kemps'<br />desk for him to officially sign, something he has<br />voiced major support for for a while. As for the<br />other two bills listed, they have a decent amount<br />of support on both sides and are also likely they<br />pass. The Senate is currently reading the House's<br />HB 340 on banning cell phones in elem/middle<br />schools. Many southern states have done similar<br />things already.","Nathaniel Long (29%): Currently, none of these<br />bills are scheduled to come to the legislative<br />floor for the next five days, leaving 6 days that<br />these bills could be addressed. Despite Republican<br />majorities in both the House and Senate, it is<br />unlikely that all three bills would have the<br />chance to be fully discussed and thought over by<br />the Georgia Legislature before the Legislative<br />session adjourns, owing to their controversial<br />nature and the fact that all three of these bills<br />would need to pass individually.","Niomi Nurse (70%): The law to ban the use of cell<br />phones and social media in schools is already set<br />in motion for the state of Georgia. The measure<br />has been approved by the house of representatives<br />about two weeks ago. Experts have testified at<br />hearings that smartphones and social media used<br />in the classroom impact student behavior and their<br />abilities to focus.","Pablo Martinez (75%): Two of the three bills —<br />SB 68 (tort reform) and HB 340 (school cell phone<br />ban) — have strong support and are already well<br />along in the legislative process, making them<br />likely to pass. SB 68 just needs the governor’s<br />signature, while HB 340 has bipartisan appeal<br />and is moving through the Senate. SB 74 (explicit<br />library materials) is more controversial and<br />faces tighter timing, which lowers its odds. there<br />deadlines are as of march 28th so there is some<br />increased pressure into passing these","Quintin Gallardo (70%): With today’s question<br />of whether SB 68, SB 74 and HB 340 will all pass<br />during this legislative session I placed low<br />hopes in the passage of all three originally until<br />seeing that two of the three habit already been<br />passed during the legislative session leaving only<br />HB 340 to be passed. Though I’m still skeptical<br />that the third will pass. It is most likely that<br />with a Republican bill in a Republican controlled<br />house and Senate that the legislative session will<br />see it pass.","Rebecca Mcadam (70%): I think all three of these<br />bills has a fairly high chance of being passed.<br />Georgia SB 68 has already been passed by the<br />Georgia legislature and is pending in terms of<br />Kemp's signature. The other two bills have passed<br />through one chamber and are pending approval in<br />the other. Given significant support and committee<br />dedication to these bills, I think they will pass.","Riley Batz (33%): Though I am confident all 3<br />of these bills will pass given the Republican<br />majority in both the house and the senate, I don't<br />find it to be extremely probable that all will<br />pass this particular legislative session (this<br />year). Georgia operates in biennial sessions, and<br />many bills can be introduced and passed by one<br />house in a single session, but ultimately take 2<br />sessions to pass overall. Though I am confident<br />SB 68 will pass this session, this puts the other<br />2 bills (SB 74 and HB 340) on the back burner for<br />priorities this session. For all of these bills<br />to pass, which are overwhelming conservative and<br />large impact, would take a sweeping effort by<br />Republicans. I don't foresee this happening.","Ruby Douglas (75%): So, looking at how things are<br />going right now, SB 68 (the tort reform bill) is<br />looking like it’s going to pass by the end of the<br />session. It’s already passed through the House and<br />Senate, and it’s just waiting for Governor Brian<br />Kemp's signature to become law. So, it's pretty<br />much a done deal. As for SB 74 (the bill about<br />explicit materials in libraries) and HB 340 (the<br />school cell phone ban), they're still making their<br />way through the process. SB 74 has already passed<br />the Senate and is now in the hands of the House<br />committee, with a big vote coming up soon. HB 340<br />passed the House and is now waiting for the Senate<br />to vote. Both bills are still alive, but they’ll<br />need to clear a few more hurdles (committee<br />hearings, votes) before we know if they’ll make it<br />to the finish line.","Sarah Joyce (70%): I think it is likely that these<br />bills will pass. Although they are controversial<br />and partisan, Republicans have a clear majority<br />in both the House and Senate of the Georgia<br />legislature. This makes it easier for them to get<br />the bills they want through. Also, the Tort Reform<br />bill has already been passed, and the other two<br />bills have already made progress through, which<br />indicates that it is more likely that they will be<br />passed.","Senait Pirani (29%): SB 68 is almost certain to<br />become law, needing only the governor’s signature.<br />SB 74 and HB 340 still face hurdles, with their<br />fate depending on legislative priorities. SB 74<br />may have an edge due to its controversial nature,<br />while HB 340 could struggle to gain enough support<br />before the session ends.","Sreya Pandyaram (66%): I feel that the bills will<br />get passed, but because there is a varied amount<br />of qualifications for each, there does seem to<br />be a bit of chaos. If anything, the tort is a 100<br />and the rest of the bills seem to either have 50%<br />going for them. The chances that they do qualify<br />in time is iffy, but not completely out of the<br />blue since the republicans do control both the<br />house and the senate.","Teya Hagy (67%): I think that there is a highly<br />probable chance that Georgia SB 68, SB 74 and<br />the school cell phone ban will get passed before<br />the end of the legislative session. They have all<br />progressed and had support from the committees<br />and it is probably that at least 2 of them will<br />be past, so I think that the third will also be<br />passed as well at a solid 67%.","Thomas Smith (85%): SB 68 seemed to be the most<br />difficult here to get passed but now that the<br />necessary concessions have been made to garner<br />those who were wary at first I believe it is very<br />likely that all these bills make it out of this<br />legislative session and are passed into law. If<br />any are to be struck down for any reason I find it<br />more likely than not for them to be reintroduced<br />in the next legislative session.","Tiyanah Rowtham (5%): The end of the legislative<br />session is April 3 which is in 11 days. After<br />researching each bill, it seems like Republicans<br />support all of those bills and right now they are<br />58% of the Georgia Senate. Nonetheless, I do not<br />think there is a good chance that all 3 of the<br />bills will get passed. SB 74 did not pass out of<br />at least one chamber by Crossover Day on March 6,<br />meaning it is unlikely to progress further","Townsend Turner (56%): The first and the third<br />bills have in my opinion a high chance of being<br />passed in the next two weeks. The first has little<br />concrete opposition and with major executive<br />support, it seems sure to pass, with part of<br />the reform bills already on the governor’s desk.<br />The third has already passed out of committee in<br />the Senate and looks headed for a vote it likely<br />wins, as every opposition has what seems to be<br />an answer for the skeptics within the bill itself<br />(ie. waivers and exemptions for cell phone use<br />during the school day if truly needed). However,<br />the second bill promises to be a battle ground and<br />while I do believe that it will be passed, this<br />is only due to partisanship, as several Democrats<br />are willing to go to war over the librarian<br />protections and more importantly actually<br />have legal grounds on which to stand regarding<br />censorship justifications and discrimination<br />against LGBTQIAP+ authors and topics.","Tristan Thompson (60%): Bill SB 68 has already<br />passed through the house and senate, 74 seems<br />to have bipartisan approval, the only shaky bill<br />out of the three is HB 340, the cell phone ban<br />could be seen as a bit extreme by certain senate<br />voters making the vote less probable, however,<br />the bill has already passed through the senate<br />committee with a 5-1 vote, and since it is a<br />republican-proposed bill, I will give the edge to<br />these bills being approved.","Vangeli Tsiaras (60%): Governor Kemp and<br />his administration support these three house<br />bills. Each has passed in the Georgia House of<br />Representatives and been sent to the Georgia<br />Senate for final review and passage. Given that<br />both chambers of the Georgia House are majority<br />Republican, I think it will be a priority for Kemp<br />and the House to pass these bills promptly and<br />sometime before April 4th, especially before Brian<br />Kemp's possible and highly anticipated Senatorial<br />run.","Wyatt Stevenson (70%): The Tort Reform has already<br />passed both chambers, the explicit materials in<br />libraries bill has already been passed through<br />Senate and is waiting for House decision, and the<br />cell phone ban has passed house and needs a full<br />Senate vote. Each of these bills has already made<br />a ton of progress and I think it will continue<br />to lead toward that direction by the end of the<br />legislative session which is around the start of<br />April.","James Martin (70%): I think there is a 70%<br />probability that Georgia SB 68 (Tort Reform),<br />SB 74 (Explicit Materials in Libraries), and HB<br />340 (School Cell Phone Ban) will be passed by<br />the end of the legislative session. SB 68 has<br />already passed both Georgia House and Senate<br />and now is awaiting the Governor's signature.<br />SB 74 has passed the senate and is currently<br />under consideration in the house with a hearing<br />scheduled for tomorrow. HB340 is only awaiting<br />a vote by the full senate. With SB 68 almost<br />certainty it will pass and the other two<br />progressing at a promising pace, I find it likely<br />they will pass by the end of the legislative<br />session."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":151.23287671232882},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Georgia SB 68 (Tort<br />Reform), SB 74 (Explicit<br />Materials in Libraries),<br />and HB 340 (School Cell<br />Phone Ban) be passed<br />by the end of the<br />legislative session?"],"tickvals":[1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Georgia SB 68 (Tort<br />Reform), SB 74 (Explicit<br />Materials in Libraries),<br />and HB 340 (School Cell<br />Phone Ban) be passed<br />by the end of the<br />legislative session?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"44c43ca77f5":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"44c4c7139fb":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"44c43ca77f5","visdat":{"44c43ca77f5":["function (y) ","x"],"44c4c7139fb":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
