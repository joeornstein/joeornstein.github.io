In a majority of our games,<br />I felt that we were nearly guaranteed to win<br />at about 95% chance of winning. Our games with<br />Alabama and Texas dropped our chances considerably<br />as I felt we had a 40% and 50% chance of winning<br />respectively. Taking into account our record<br />against Alabama and Texas' new talent I felt these<br />were accurate, bringing the probability of going<br />undefeated to about 15%.","Brooke McDermott (80%): I reviewed the ESPN power<br />ranking chart that we talked about in class.<br />UGA was ranked 1st in their team strength, which<br />leads me to think they have a high probability<br />of doing extremely well in comparison to lower<br />ranked teams. However, their REM SOS is at a 3,<br />due to their schedule being relatively challenging<br />with teams like Bama and Texas on their docket.<br />However, with the loss of Saban this past season,<br />Alabama may falter, leaving Georgia more likely<br />to win. In contrast, a lot of sports analysts and<br />announcers have openly debated the Texas v. UGA<br />game and possibly the Alabama game as a potential<br />loss for UGA.","Joe Ornstein (11%): It's a much tougher schedule<br />than we've had the past two seasons, but as of Aug<br />25 we're favored to win every game. My estimate<br />is based on win probabilities implied by point<br />spreads, which tend to be very well calibrated<br />(teams cover the spread 50% of the time, with a<br />standard deviation of roughly two touchdowns).","Abby Crowe (10%): I believe that the University<br />of Georgia football team has a 10% chance of<br />going undefeated in the 2024 regular season. I<br />am basing this prediction on the College Football<br />Headquarters (CFB) odds for each individual game.<br />At a glance, UGA is favored to win every game,<br />with Alabama and Texas being the least certainty,<br />but after multiplying the probabilities against<br />each other to determine the likelihood, it no<br />longer looked too good. I landed on 9.7% chance<br />of winning all regular season games, but because I<br />love the dawgs, I’m giving them a 10% chance.","Simon Gersten (30%): To calculate the<br />probability of UGA going undefeated, I assigned<br />win probabilities for each of their games and<br />multiplied them together. Respective to their<br />schedule, probabilities of 90%, 95%, 95%, 75%,<br />75%, 99%, 99%, 80%, 95%, 99%, 90%, 99% would give<br />them a 30% chance of going undefeated.","Minha Ahmad (75%): UGA has gone three straight<br />seasons without losing a single regular season<br />game so it is very likely that they will go<br />undefeated this year as well. However, there is<br />still a bit of room for doubt which is why I am<br />not 100% sure. This season, they will be playing<br />major teams like Alabama, Texas, and Ole Miss on<br />their home turfs and not at UGA.","Haley Ford (56%): Yes- I got a probability of 56%.<br />I did a combination of equivalent bet test and<br />probability trees. I did the odds I would feel<br />most comfortable with, then used a probability<br />tree to see that likelihood. Initially- I took<br />safer odds but the probability seemed to low, so<br />I had to be more deterministic about the games<br />we would win. Clemson: 100 % (1.00) Tennessee<br />Tech: 100% (1.00) Kentucky: 100%(1.0) Alabama:<br />70% (0.70) Auburn: 100% (1.0) Mississippi State:<br />100% (1.00) Texas: 70% (0.70) Florida: 100%<br />(1.00) Ole Miss: 100% (1.00) Tennessee: 80% (0.80)<br />Massachusetts: 100% (1.00) Georgia Tech: 100%<br />(1.00)","Liv Payne (43%): I do not know much about<br />football, so I turned to the internet to figure<br />out the likelihood of UGA being undefeated. Coach<br />Kirby Smart has been at UGA since 2016. Before<br />2023, the Bulldogs had not gone undefeated since<br />1980. According to an article by Si.com, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated under Smart for<br />3 seasons in a row. Therefore, my prediction is<br />based upon Smart's performance as a coach. Out<br />of the 7 seasons that Smart has been coach, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated 3 seasons. 3/7=0.428<br />or rounded up to 43%.","Jeffrey Markowitz (30%): Georgia faces the ninth<br />toughest schedule against some very strong teams<br />on the road, in difficult atmospheres to play in.<br />While the Dawgs look great going into the season,<br />college football is unpredictable. Injuries or<br />other issues could occur that are unpredictable at<br />this point.","Jessica Armour (65%): Based on the scores from<br />last years football schedule, UGA did the best<br />over all in comparison to the other teams. It was<br />also the only team (other than alabama) to win all<br />of their away games. Since away games are where<br />people struggle the most and UGA was undefeated in<br />them I would say it is pretty likely that Uga will<br />be undefeated this season. However considering<br />after being unsuccessful in maintaining undefeated<br />last year, and losing some players there is still<br />a chance they will not be, hence why I did not<br />give a perfect score for the probability.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (80%): UGA has been<br />undefeated in the past three regular seasons,<br />so I believe that winning a 4th season is not<br />an extreme idea. A CBS article by Will Backus<br />states that Georgia has the possibility of being<br />undefeated in its 2024 regular season. I consulted<br />my friend (who is an avid college football fan),<br />and he believes the possibility is there, but<br />Georgia will need to step up and prepare itself.<br />Some of the season games will be challenging, but<br />Georgia has the roster to do it.","Carson Ankeny (30%): While I do feel that the UGA<br />Football team has the roster and coaching staff<br />that could lead to an undefeated season, it is<br />still statistically unlikely that UGA could win<br />each of its most difficult matchups. Looking at<br />the schedule, there are several tough matchups,<br />including Texas and Alabama. Losing any one of<br />these or other difficult matchups would lead<br />to the forecast being broken, and I don't feel<br />confident that the Dawgs would win all of these<br />matchups, even if I expect their final record to<br />be 11-1.","Hayden Morehouse (55%): UGA is the best team<br />in college football this year. However, I have<br />been a fan for a long time, and it is tough to<br />have a perfect season. Most sports pages have<br />us projected to go undefeated, but I am a bit<br />sheepish. Things like injuries or just simply<br />a bad game can happen. We also have a tougher<br />schedule with playing Ole Miss, Texas, and Alabama<br />away.","Kira Liscombe (10%): I used the Sports Illustrated<br />predictions for each game on Georgia's 2024<br />football schedule. I converted the percentages<br />to decimals and multiplied them together. I came<br />up with a probability of 9.4, but based on other<br />articles predicting the Georgia football season, I<br />decided to predict a bit higher at 10.","Colin Barry (60%): The Bulldogs currently have<br />their projected win total set at +/-10.5, meaning<br />the consensus opinion is that they are likely to<br />lose a game. This comes from a tough schedule and<br />a newly expanded playoff system that leaves them<br />with much more room for error and makes them more<br />accepting of a single loss. This loss could come<br />from one of our powerhouse matchups at Alabama,<br />Texas, or Ole Miss, or could come from a trap<br />game no one sees coming (see Auburn last year,<br />or anytime we've played South Carolina at noon<br />for reference). That is why i think that the odds<br />Georgia goes undefeated are still slightly more<br />likely than not at around 60%, as even with all<br />these changes this season they are still the best<br />team in football.","Franco Bravo (25%): After talking to multiple<br />sources and friends who know a good amount of<br />college football, I believe that UGA will lose<br />at least 1 game in the season. The season is<br />unpredictable and with Big Name teams like Texas<br />and Alabama, I believe that UGA will fall to<br />at least one of those teams. Additionally, like<br />last season, UGA is also capable of getting into<br />unnecessary close games that have no reason being<br />that close and some can argue that those wins came<br />with some skill but also some sort of luck.","Corinne O'Dell (9.25%): Based on the win<br />probabilities for each individual game that UGA<br />will play, you can multiply those together to<br />get an overall probability. It is relatively low<br />because with us playing Alabama and Texas in a<br />regular season game, it is very unprecedented so<br />the games are currently predicted to be toss ups.l","Shayna Van Glish (8.9%): (Detailed in much more<br />length in the briefing I completed for this<br />question) I think that there is a 8.9% chance that<br />the Bulldogs go undefeated in the regular season<br />due to the fact that they have a tough away game<br />schedule, injuries that will occur, and a team<br />that has a lot of new players working to mesh well<br />with the returnees. While this number is fairly<br />low, my overall predictions for each game are<br />fairly high, yet not guaranteed wins for many.","Vikram Bharadwaj (37.5%): In the past 24 year,<br />only one team ranked number one in the preseason<br />polls has won 2 or more highly ranked (top 10)<br />away games, with the five others losing one or<br />both of these matchups. If we ignore this and look<br />at just 3 ranked away games, the record goes up<br />to 2/7, or about 28.6%. Now being a bit generous<br />here, we can round that up to 37.5, given that<br />UGA has done well in the past and is the betting<br />favorite in all three high ranked road games.","Abigail V. Harris (1%): I used the Sports<br />Illustrated power index ratings for the UGA<br />2024 regular season lineup. I multiplied the<br />chance the Bulldogs won each game by the chance<br />they would win the next game and so on and so<br />forth until I had factored in their chance of<br />winning all 12 games in a row. In the end I got<br />a .096409641377167/10 chance that the Dawgs go<br />undefeated. Out of 100 thats .96409641377167, so<br />I rounded up and estimated their probability of<br />going undefeated would be about 1/100.","Findleigh Ague (68%): I don’t know a ton about<br />football, but I tried my best to read up on what<br />the vibes are with UGA’s schedule this season.<br />There are definitely going to be some tough<br />games this season, but I think that perhaps not<br />making it to the national championships last<br />year after winning back to back could be a strong<br />motivator for the team and lead them to victory<br />in the regular season. I also looked at ESPN’s<br />Football Power Index, and not all of the data<br />points directly applied to going undefeated in the<br />regular season, but in general it looks as though<br />their simulations that they conducted had UGA<br />winning a lot.","Gracie Culpepper (37%): Alabama will be a tough<br />game for the Dawgs. We historically have very<br />close games with them, and on top of that their<br />game this season will be in Tuscaloosa. For<br />football teams, it is more difficult to win<br />the game if they are not in their home stadium.<br />Because of this, I think that it is more unlikely<br />that UGA will have an undefeated regular season<br />with this game added into their schedule.","Alexis Frazer (65%): I started with the baseline<br />probability of going undefeated, then factored<br />into account each team's probability of beating<br />UGA. Taking into account Georgia's records in<br />the 3 most recent years, the probability of going<br />undefeated would be greater than any other SEC<br />team. The Alabama game could go unfavorably (based<br />off the SEC champ game last season), however,<br />because they lost their head coach and multiple<br />starters, Bama's likelihood of beating UGA is<br />lower this year than last. UT is not going to be<br />a problem given it is their first year in the SEC,<br />so on, so forth, until I came to 65%.","Erin Ho (5%): The reason I chose this estimate<br />is because I looked up UGA’s upcoming football<br />games and made my own estimate based on what I<br />knew about UGA and what I knew about the teams we<br />were playing. I multiplied all the values I made,<br />because this is what I think are our chances of<br />winning consecutively, no possibilities of losing<br />at all. I initially thought of 78%, because that’s<br />the median for all the percentages, but this<br />seemed more correct to me.","Victor Avila (80%): I believe the FED will decide<br />to lower its rates at its September meeting with<br />an 80% probability. I came to these findings<br />through researching the history of the Federal<br />Interest Rates and how long they typically peak<br />and fall. Rates most recently peaked in August<br />2023 at 5.33. I then found a point in time with<br />similar rates and similar inflation (2.9). This<br />year was 2006. ⅘ similar scenarios have rates<br />peaking for about a year before the FED drops<br />rates. August 2024 makes a year that rates have<br />been steady at 5.33 as I anticipate them lowering<br />in september.","Reece Slater (22%): I first examined all preseason<br />#1 ranked college football teams since 1990 and<br />looked at the frequency of an undefeated regular<br />season. First I did SEC only teams, which was<br />33.3%, then I looked at all teams which was 40.9%.<br />I then used the tree branch (visualization) method<br />and multiplied all of the probabilities that UGA<br />would win each game according to ESPN Analytics.<br />This gave me a probability of 8.7% that UGA goes<br />undefeated. I then used the equivalent bet test<br />to find where my gut feels in the middle of this<br />data. This brought me to my conclusion of 22%<br />probability.","Leo Zegarra (60%): Although it may seem very<br />unlikely given the schedule this year, I believe<br />that the dawgs will go undefeated mainly due to<br />their depth. Because injuries occur so often in<br />football and teams are usually held back from<br />their potential as result, UGA simply shines<br />in the aspect of roster depth. Obviously, Kirby<br />Smart and his coaching staff is also exceptional,<br />meaning that this season will be backed up by<br />great minds and a great Carson Beck. Plus, 15<br />dawgs were named to the all SEC team, including<br />numerous offensive linemen, which are key to<br />allowing a great QB work his magic. Plus, UGA<br />has great defensive players who were named, which<br />prevents easy scoring. All in all, the teams they<br />are facing aren't as strong, especially when you<br />look at Alabama, who lost their head coach and<br />three outstanding players to the transfer portal.","Matthew Harvey (75%): My reasoning behind<br />assigning this number involves several factors<br />including my confidence level, regular season<br />games, starting rosters of the UGA, as well as<br />starting players for other teams. UGA is rated,<br />according to the Football Power Index, to be the<br />favorites to win the SEC as well as being the<br />favorites to make it to the National Championship<br />game as well. This index should let alone give<br />UGA a 50% chance of success in the regular season.<br />However, the issue is that other teams that are in<br />the top 5 likely teams to have a chance of winning<br />the national championship are among the teams UGA<br />has to play in the regular season. They are both<br />away games which also are historically shown to be<br />more difficult for away teams to win if the games<br />are determined to be contested. Therefore I am<br />confident this puts UGA directly between 100% and<br />50%.","Rommy Etzion (0%): The real question is what<br />are the odds Georgia is going to lose 1 game.<br />According the predictions made by \"Dawn of the<br />Dog,\", there are 3 games they are expected to<br />lose. So the question is if there's a probability<br />they win instead of lose. According to the<br />websites predictions, there is an expected game<br />where the dogs lose 52-17 and another 38-12. If<br />calculating the probability that UGA turns it<br />around, it would be very low. Going undefeated is<br />incredibly hard and statistically, based on expert<br />predictions, unlikely. A single loss means they<br />would not have an undefeated record, and there<br />are 3 predictions of a loss. Sorry to sound like a<br />pessimist, I also don't know much about football.","Alex Vrolijk (60%): I chose 60% because while I<br />believe UGA is one of the if not the best team<br />going into the upcoming season, we have some<br />difficult away games. The away games I am most<br />worried about are the Alabama and Texas games<br />because Alabama has had a lot of roster changes<br />and Texas is predicted to be a very strong team.","David Daniels (10%): To put my conclusion shortly,<br />no. After referring to resources made available<br />to the public (these including professional<br />sports analyzers, and betting odds) it becomes<br />apparent that the probability of some games<br />(let alone the whole) is less than a coin flip.<br />Considering that there are 12 games in the<br />regular season, someone without any college<br />football would deduce that the probability is<br />simply 0.5^12 equaling roughly 0.024%. However,<br />some of these games are not a coinflip. A decent<br />portion of the games in our conference have UGA<br />favored significantly. Sport analysts essentially<br />dismiss all games with exception to a few, Ol<br />Miss Texas, and Alabama. In these games we are<br />also the favored team. Projected Outcomes 2024<br />Schedule: 1. Clemson Georgia's odds: 82.3%<br />2. Tennessee Tech Georgia's odds: 99.0% 3. at<br />Kentucky Georgia's odds: 88.0% 4. at Alabama<br />Georgia's odds: 59.1% 5. Auburn Georgia's odds:<br />88.4% 6. Mississippi State Georgia's odds: 93.9%<br />7. at Texas Georgia's odds: 52.4% 8. Florida<br />Georgia's odds: 85.3% 9. at Ole Miss Georgia's<br />odds: 78.8% 10. Tennessee Georgia's odds: 79.4%<br />11. UMass Georgia's odds: 99.0% Figures for<br />GA Tech game 12 not available. This is what It<br />would look like to crunch these numbers: Total<br />Probability=0.823×0.990×0.880×0.591×0.884×0.939×0.524×0.853×0.788×0.794×0.990<br />Totaling in a rough probability of 9.716%, or a<br />10 on a scale from 1-100. Give these numbers it<br />is not likely that UGA will go undefeated in the<br />regular season despite being the favorites.","John Mathis (45%): I used the equivalent bet<br />test to get a read on my gut feeling, and I would<br />rather get 1000 dollars if they go undefeated<br />than guessing on a slightly weighted coin flip.<br />Furthermore, I looked at individual game win<br />chances and weighted my answer based on that.","Joe Ornstein (40%): In all of the 20th century,<br />there were only 19 years when a Category IV or<br />higher storm made landfall on the mainland US<br />(according to NOAA). Then during the first 15<br />years of the 21st century, there was only *one*<br />such year (Hurricane Charley in 2004). This is a<br />pretty low base rate. But since 2016, 5 out of 8<br />years have seen a Category IV storm make landfall<br />in the US! The key question here is whether we<br />should consider this the \"new normal\", or if we<br />should expect some regression to the mean. I will<br />split the difference between these two views.","Corinne O'Dell (52%): Based on the past fifty<br />years, there have been 9 hurricanes in the US that<br />have been a category 4 or above. Using this and<br />factoring the NOAA's predicitions for major storms<br />this upcoming season, there is a toss up chance<br />for a category 4 or above hurricane to hit.","Ryan Foley (35%): Only 23% of hurricanes in the<br />2010s that hit the mainland were category 4 or<br />above. Currently, in the 2020s we are at 25% for<br />category 4 landfalls. Combining this with the fact<br />that we are projected to have a more active than<br />average hurricane season, I concluded that 35%<br />would be feasible as it is still unlikely but not<br />quite as much as 25%.","Erin Ho (75%): I chose this estimate was because I<br />had looked at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br />Administration’s hurricane reports. Based on<br />the records from the NOAA, in years where they<br />predicted an above-normal season, there was a<br />Category IV or above hurricane. Examples are<br />Hurricane Laura in 2020 (Category IV), Hurricane<br />Ida in 2021 (Category IV), and Hurricane Ian<br />(Category IV). In May of this year, the NOAA<br />predicted we would have an above-normal season<br />for 2024. As of the end of August, we have already<br />had one tropical storm, and two hurricanes make<br />landfall in the US.","Abby Crowe (70%): I predict that there is a 70%<br />chance of a category IV or above hurricane hitting<br />the mainland United States before December 1st.<br />This prediction is based on predictions from<br />the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association<br />(NOAA) for this storm season, as well as a cross<br />comparison to previous years, their weather<br />patterns, and former NOAA predictions. (This is<br />the introduction to my brief)","Alexis Frazer (82%): Rising temperatures and<br />the consistency over the past 3 years of 1 or<br />more stage IV hurricanes striking mainland US<br />makes it very probable for a stage IV hurricane<br />to hit this year. They typically occur from<br />august-october, and are even more likely if<br />temperatures are abnormally high. The national<br />oceanic and atmospheric assosciation predicted its<br />likelihood to be 85% or higher. I calculated the<br />probability based off of data from recent years<br />and meteorologists general consensus on the issue.","Carson Ankeny (20%): Looking only at hurricanes<br />since the year 2000, it is fairly rare that a<br />category 4 storm makes landfall on the mainland<br />as a category 4. By my count, there were only<br />6 storms that made contact as a category 4 or<br />above according to the National Hurricane Center<br />and NOAA. That means that 6/24 years since 2000,<br />there was a category 4 to hit the mainland, which<br />would be a 25% chance. However, since hurricane<br />season starts in June, and we are already in<br />August (and nearly September), I think that the<br />window is closing a bit. For that reason, I marked<br />the probably slightly lower than that data would<br />suggest, at 20%.","Brooke McDermott (19%): La Niña is predicted to be<br />much more intense this coming season. Water in the<br />Atlantic is reportedly at record warmth, and in<br />addition to this, the West African Monsoon winds<br />are reportedly extremely high this season. These<br />in combination with other environmental factors<br />influencing climate change and the atmosphere,<br />there is a much higher chance that the East Cost<br />and Gulf Shore of the US may experience more<br />intense hurricane such as a Cat 4 or 5. This being<br />said, I'm unsure if the hurricane will actually<br />hit land at a Cat 4 or 5. We have seen a Cat<br />5 hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, hit the US Gulf<br />Coast this year. And with increasing intensity in<br />weather trends, it wouldn't be out of left field<br />for another large hurricane to hit the mainland.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): I think regardless of<br />any research you do this question is a tossup.<br />However, I put my probability at 15% for these<br />reasons. Since August of 2020 three category four<br />hurricanes have hit the US mainland. The last<br />one being in September of 2022. This means the<br />probability should be higher right? The reason I<br />put it so low is because my research shows that<br />August and September are the busiest months for<br />hurricanes. Three of the last four of these things<br />have hit in August, which is essentially over.<br />Giving us one more month to have a real shot at a<br />hurricane as big as category 4.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): The National Oceanic<br />and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an<br />above-normal hurricane season due to factors like<br />record-warm sea surface temperatures. 14-21 storms<br />are to occur, with 2-5 major hurricanes coming<br />from these (Cat 3 or higher). Given this forecast,<br />I think the probability of one of these hitting<br />the US mainland as a Cat 4 or higher is 25.","Minha Ahmad (60%): This year there have been<br />record breaking warm ocean temperatures, and the<br />NOAA has forecasted that there will be 4-7 major<br />hurricanes with a 3, 4, or 5 category rating<br />in the Atlantic in 2024. The last Category 4<br />hurricane was Hurricane Ida in 2021, however,<br />because 4-7 major hurricanes are predicted to hit<br />the US this year, I think that there is a high<br />chance a category 4 hurricane will be among them.","William Willis (66%): I believe that there is<br />a 66 probability that there will be a category<br />4 hurricane hit by December 1 of this year. The<br />reason behind by confidence is that the latest one<br />of these hurricanes has ever hit was November. I<br />did a little bit of research on the likely hood<br />of it happening and each weather website said<br />that warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea<br />could result in a hurricane. Also other factors<br />such as reduced vertical wind shear and weaker<br />tropical Atlantic trade winds.","Simon Gersten (25%): The current NOAA forecast<br />predicts an 85% chance of an above-normal<br />hurricane season, with 4-7 major hurricanes<br />expected this year. Given that the season is<br />likely to favor strong hurricanes, there is<br />significant likelihood of a Cat 4 or cat 5<br />hurricane occurring. Historically, the U.S.<br />mainland is hit by a Cat 4 or above hurricane<br />every 2-3 years, and given the other conditions,<br />the likelihood is higher than an average year, but<br />still not extremely likely.","Vikram Bharadwaj (10%): While in the past 24<br />years there have been six total hurricanes to have<br />hit mainland US at a category 4 or higher level,<br />four of them were either at the very beginning<br />of September or middle of August. Seeing as how<br />the NOAA gives a 20% chance of a storm forming in<br />the next two weeks, I chose to exclude those four<br />hurricanes, giving us a 2/24 = ~8% rounding that<br />up to 10 percent.","Kira Liscombe (60%): Firstly, I confirmed that the<br />Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from Sat, Jun 1,<br />2024 – Sat, Nov 30, 2024, which means we are in<br />the peak of the season. I learned that Hurricane<br />Idalia was the only U.S. landfalling hurricane<br />in 2023, and it made landfall as a category-3<br />hurricane. This gave me some doubts about how<br />likely we were to receive a category 4 this year.<br />However, I also found that NOAA’s outlook for the<br />2024 Atlantic hurricane season predicts an 85%<br />chance of an above-normal season. Considering all<br />of this i ended up with a probability of 60, since<br />there is high likeleiedhood of an active season<br />this year but low historical frequency of Cat. 4<br />landfalls.","Gracie Culpepper (40%): I'm putting my answer<br />higher for a few reasons. The first is that<br />we have 2 months left of hurricane season and<br />have already had 2 Cat-4 hurricanes since 2021<br />alone. The second is that we are in the midst<br />of a La Nina year, which makes it more likely<br />to experience turbulent weather in the Atlantic<br />Ocean. My third reason is that the NOAA's<br />prediction for this year is that hurricane season<br />may be one of the busiest on record. For these<br />reasons, I'm putting it at 40% likely to happen.","Haley Ford (13%): NOAA reports: 79% of La<br />Niña, 90% above normal season and 70% chance<br />in August/October. 8/13 storms are forecasted<br />to be hurricanes, 4-7 major hurricanes with a<br />confidence of 70%. So, I did 79%+70% /2. Then *<br />70% confidence * .25 for my guess of what chance a<br />hurricane would be 4 if it was any category.","David Daniels (73%): After extensive research<br />from weather forecast professionals, historical<br />data, and the equivalency test, I have concluded<br />a favorable probability of a Category 4 or greater<br />hurricane making landfall prior to December 1st<br />in the USA. Weather experts estimate a rough<br />probability of .70 that these circumstances prove<br />true. Likewise, in the last 7 years alone, 6<br />hurricanes have met this criteria. lastly weather<br />patterns such as La Niña and El Niño positively<br />impact the probability of a hurricane to our<br />requirements. All of these factors considered, I<br />give a probability of .73 in favor.","Edward L Tsui (23%): According to the National<br />Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane<br />Center, only two category IV and one category<br />V hurricane hit the U.S between 2011 and 2020.<br />With only being in this modern decade three to<br />4 years, there have already been two category IV<br />hurricanes. The 3 out of 19 total hurricanes in<br />the first decade leads to a 0.158 probability in<br />the decade. However, The official NOAA predicts an<br />above-normal Atlantic hurricane season with rising<br />temperatures. Thus I about 1.5X the previous<br />probability to account for weather patterns<br />increasing in temperature this season. The most<br />frequent months for hurricanes happen by September<br />but the season lasts until about November.","John Mathis (85%): 6 out of the past 7 years have<br />had at least one Cat 4 or above, with some years<br />having multople, which would be a base rate of<br />around 85%. Furthermore, we seem to be in a La<br />Nina year, which makes conditions for hurricanes<br />more favorable. NOAA lists the following factors<br />that would also increase the likelihood of a CAT<br />4: Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean<br />Sea. Reduced vertical wind shear. Weaker tropical<br />Atlantic trade winds. An enhanced west African<br />monsoon. Even Last year, during a very strong<br />el Nino year we had a cat 4, and due to rising<br />global average temperatures, I see no reason for<br />this to all of a sudden make a switch on a year<br />with more favorable conditions. You have to go<br />back to 2016 to find a La Nina year where aCat 4<br />did not hit the mainland US, and I theorize that<br />this was due to Hurricane Matthews path that year,<br />which went over Haiti, Grand bahamas, AND cuba<br />before reaching south carolina, giving ample time<br />and land for the storm to dissipate. This was<br />also during a weak la Nina year without the other<br />favorable conditions.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (20%): I think that<br />before hurricane season ends, we will see a<br />category 4 hurricane. However, I don't think it<br />will hit mainland US as a category 4. I looked<br />at the previous hurricanes seasons this season<br />has been compared to (1878, 1926, 1998, 2010,<br />and 2020) and only 2 were category 4 when they<br />hit mainland US. The season has been quite so far<br />because of the Atlantic Nina.","Rommy Etzion (18%): In June, the beginning of the<br />season, forecasters reported in high confidence<br />that it’s predicted to be a busy above-average<br />season (85%), with about 4-7 major hurricanes.<br />There are near-record warm temperatures, less wind<br />shear in the Atlantic which allows hurricanes to<br />intensify, and an abundant oceanic heat content<br />in the tropical Atlantic which creates more energy<br />to fuel developments. That being said, its been<br />eerily quiet in the Atlantic this month, which<br />was unexpected to forecasters, and has strayed<br />from their original forecast. This is significant<br />because August is the 2nd most active month,<br />following September. This shows that so far,<br />the forecasters overestimated the season. This<br />development significantly lowers my prediction.","Abigail Harris (70%): First I looked up some<br />of the national statistics on how likely<br />administrations thought it would be that the<br />mainland US would be hit by a major hurricane.<br />The average of those predictions came around to<br />about 60% (inflated by including CAT 3s). Every<br />three years approximately 2 major (CAT 3 or above)<br />hurricanes hit the mainland US, or it's about<br />66.67% likely. In the last 4 years, 3 major storms<br />(CAT 4 or above for my purposes) have hit the<br />mainland US at about a 75% likeliness. However,<br />I wanted to balance longterm data trends and<br />shortterm conditions by choosing a middle ground<br />that accounts for an expert prediction (unreliable<br />this far out) of about 60%. Thus, I went sightly<br />for the lower side by picking 70/100, 5 pts down<br />from the higher trend, 3-4pts from the lower.","Matthew Harvey (74%): According to Wikipedia<br />which has decent data regarding this particular<br />question, the 3 most prominent months where a<br />category 4 hurricane manifests are in August,<br />September, and October. The rough estimate of the<br />amount that have been quantified within these 3<br />months are roughly 140. The amount of category<br />4’s that have hit the mainland are around 84<br />roughly. Therefore, if you were to use the total<br />amount of category 4’s to hit landfall and put<br />that over the total amount of cat 4’s between July<br />and November being 147 you get a probability of<br />around 57%. However this takes data from in the<br />1850’s and before the Saffir-Simpson scale was<br />invented which took place in 1971. The new number<br />of landfall hurricanes is now 39 as opposed to the<br />84 previously. The amount of category 4 hurricanes<br />since 1971 has been 61. Therefore the new<br />statistic I am going with is around 63% likely.<br />The NOAA predicts that 2024 will have an above<br />normal hurricane season for 24 with putting there<br />odds around 85% likely to have an abnormal season.<br />I am going to take the mean of there score and<br />mine and put it at about a 74% likely chance we<br />will see a category 4 hurricane hit the mainland.<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Category_4_Atlantic_hurricanes<br />https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season","Colin Barry (65%): I would say that it is more<br />likely than not that a category 4 or greater<br />hurricane will make landfall in the U.S. this<br />hurricane season. The Atlantic Ocean Basin is<br />projected to be incredibly active this hurricane<br />season due to factors like increased sea surface<br />temperatures, weaker Atlantic trade winds, and<br />and enhanced west African monsoon. The season has<br />already seen the fastest formation of a category 5<br />ever with Hurricane Beryl, even if it didn't make<br />landfall. These factors point to a very active<br />hurricane season which i think has a 65% chance of<br />a category 4 or greater storm making landfall.","Reece Slater (60%): Looked at NOAA data. Looked at<br />historical hurricane data. Very high air and water<br />temperatures and El Nino/La Nina activity.","Leo Zegarra (70%): Based off of recent years,<br />there's a higher average of Category 4 hurricanes<br />hitting the mainland. The last time one hit was<br />in 2022 and they are said to hit the mainland once<br />every 3 years. Plus, there is a really high chance<br />of La Niña happening in September, which is said<br />to increase the likelihood of major hurricanes,<br />which include Category 4 hurricanes. Plus, the<br />climate in recent years has been historically<br />higher compared to years prior, which boosts the<br />probability. Plus, there is a higher probability<br />of hurricanes occurring is in the next couple<br />of months, which fits in the timeline of before<br />December 1st. Also, what is scarier than a<br />hurricane hitting the mainland is a hurricane not<br />hitting the mainland for a while. So, I am fairly<br />confident that a category 4 will hit the mainland<br />before December 1st.","Jeffrey Markowitz (75%): Hurricanes and other<br />tropical storms are becoming very common.","Liv Payne (85%): NOOA says that \", a typical<br />season will yield 14 named storms, of which<br />seven become hurricanes and three become major<br />hurricanes.\" However, this season seems to be more<br />extreme due to higher temperatures and heavier<br />rain, so they predict at 90% that this season<br />will yield above-normal results. Also, category<br />4 hurricanes hitting land seem to be increasing,<br />with 2 (Franklin and Idalia) hitting land in<br />2023. Therefore, I think it is highly likely that<br />another cat 4 hurricane will hit.","Alex Vrolijk (5%): This is because on average only<br />2 hurricanes hit mainland US per year, and we are<br />already halfway through the hurricane season. It<br />is also rare for a cat 4 or above Hurricane to<br />hit the mainland. However, there have been cat<br />4+ hurricanes that have hit US mainland in recent<br />years including in 2017, 2018, and 2022. Although<br />it is not impossible for a cat 4+ hurricane to hit<br />the mainland before Dec. 1st (with September being<br />the most active month), it is highly unlikely.","Jessica armour (20%): Based on past years, there<br />has only been a handful of Cat. 5 hurricanes to<br />hit U.S. soil, therefore it is very unlikely that<br />one will hit by Dec 2. With that being said, it<br />would be more likely that a hurricane within a<br />lower category would hit U.S. soil because they<br />are more common in occurrence than those of Cat. 5","Franco Bravo (65%): After doing several research<br />the last couple days and also talking a family<br />member who is involved in weather and climate in<br />Jamaica, he told me that it is pretty probable<br />for their to be a cat 4 storm. Also in the last 10<br />years it has happend more than half the time, so<br />hence the reason why I chose 65.","Jeffrey Markowitz (95%): Every single indicator is<br />pointing towards the Fed lowering interest rates.<br />The Federal Reserve has held multiple meetings to<br />discuss it, and it is very public that they will<br />lower interest rates for the first time since<br />2020.","Joe Ornstein (95%): Jay Powell's speech at Jackson<br />Hole last week was an unambiguous signal that the<br />Fed Board of Governors plans to announce cut rates<br />at its September meeting. Futures markets on the<br />Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Fedwatch) suggest<br />that investors are only uncertain about *how<br />much* rates will be cut, not whether they will be<br />cut. There is still an inflation report scheduled<br />to be released by BLS a few days before the Fed<br />meeting, so I'm allowing for the possibility that<br />an unexpectedly bad report causes the Fed to hold<br />off rate cuts until after the November election.","Ryan Foley (95%): Recently Jerome Powell implied<br />that a cut is rates is coming during a speech<br />at Jackson Hole. He stated, \"The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.\" This appears to be him<br />telling Americans that cuts are coming and chances<br />are they will be during this upcoming September<br />meeting.","Jessica armour (61%): Based on my math of how<br />economy stimulation has decreased from 2023-2024<br />and knowing that the economy needs stimulation<br />in order to thrive, and also based on the trends<br />of inflation rates it is not likely that the<br />inflation rates will continue to rise and will<br />rather decrease even if by a minute amount in<br />order to ensure stimulation of the economy.","Abby Crowe (75%): I give it a 75% chance that<br />the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates at its<br />September meeting. I base this prediction almost<br />entirely on language presented by Jerome Powell,<br />the Chair of the Fed. Specifically this quote:<br />“The time has come for policy to adjust. The<br />direction of travel is clear, and the timing and<br />pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data,<br />the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,”<br />which he said in late August. He has hinted in the<br />past year at several cuts, and with the last two<br />meetings of the year approaching quickly, I think<br />there is a high likelihood of interest rate cuts<br />at the next meeting. Because I am in no place to<br />speak on markets and the fluctuation of interest<br />rates, I am leaning into expert opinions and<br />direct quotes to guide my forecast.","Hayden Morehouse (95%): I put 95% for this<br />question for mainly one reason, Federal Reserve<br />Chair Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole about<br />a week ago and he strongly hinted that the Fed<br />plans to cut rates. He said “The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel<br />is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts<br />will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks,”. To me<br />this means that a rate cut is coming, they just<br />have not declared how much rates will be cut<br />by. This has been something that has been long<br />overdue in some peoples eyes and I am nearly<br />certain the announcment will come in September.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Haley Ford (95%): I am giving this such a high<br />probability because the word's out of Jerome<br />Powell's mouth himself, and the slew of articles<br />from WSJ, NYT etc. that verify that a rate cut<br />is expected, it is the amount that is a point of<br />speculation at the moment.","Colin Barry (75%): In recent weeks, speculation<br />over whether the FED will cut interest rates has<br />largely shifted from whether or not they will cut<br />them to, how much will they lower them by. This<br />follows Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair,<br />'s recent hint that changes will be coming soon<br />and that the direct of these changes has become<br />clear. This indicates that questions of when the<br />FED will cut rates will be answered, the only<br />question that remains is how soon. Many fixed<br />markets are fully preparing for the FED to cut<br />rates at its September meeting, as experts have<br />predicted following this hint. I expect that this<br />preparation indicates that there is around a 75%<br />chance that rates will be cut on September 18th.","Brooke McDermott (85%): It seems extremely likely<br />that the Fed will cut rates this September. The<br />Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has<br />said publicly that that's what the Fed intend to<br />do coming closer to the meeting. Inflation has<br />fallen significantly from our peak two years ago,<br />and is not far off from the Fed's target at 2.5%.<br />I think the next question is how much will the Fed<br />cut down, which seems to be the common denominator<br />amongst news outlets. Some Wall Street traders<br />are estimating that there is a 1/3 chance that<br />the Fed will cut by at least a half point, others<br />are saying a proposal of .25 over the span of the<br />next three meetings. I felt it may be best to stay<br />conservative in my prediction due to the fact that<br />the August unemployment rate will play a role in<br />how much the Fed cuts rates, in addition to other<br />factors. I think this pay pose a small risk to the<br />rates decreasing. Additionally, there is some risk<br />politically in that it would benefit the Harris<br />campaign greatly for us to see continued growth,<br />and the Trump campaign is extremely resistant to<br />rate cuts so close to the election.","Franco Bravo (75%): After having discussed with<br />several of my friends who are business, finance<br />and overall more in tune with this subject, they<br />are very confident that the Fed will lower rates.<br />One of my friends told me that they discussed this<br />in one of his classes and his professor told them<br />that he was almost positive that this infact will<br />happen.","Alexis Frazer (85%): The chairman of the feds<br />asserted a very strong message in his last remarks<br />that the interest rates will be taken down this<br />quarter. The primary debate surrounding interest<br />rates is less whether or not the reserve will<br />decrease interest rates, but rather by how much<br />they will decrease interest rates. Will it be a<br />quarter or half point reduction? I will be happy<br />with either, and am hoping this politician is<br />being truthful because it has been a decent amount<br />of time since interest rates were lowered and they<br />nearly promised an upcoming change.","Edward L Tsui (84.5%): I am hedging my<br />probability. I based my number on multiple<br />sources. According to CNBC and Fox Business, the<br />term trader used indicates traders think there<br />is a 100% chance of a FED rate cut. Other sources<br />indicate a 93.3% probability, and the 30 day FED<br />Future Rate with the CME group (at 4:50pm) show a<br />reduction in expected price of the future of 0.02%<br />in the future price, which is about a 25 to a 80<br />base point reduction in the overall interest rate.<br />According to the FED Watch as well, there is a<br />67.5% expectation of a target rate in September to<br />be between 500-525 base points (5-5.25% interest<br />rate) and a 37.5% expectation for 475-500 base<br />points. (4.75-5% interest rate) Both expectations<br />are lower than the current rate this week of 5.5%","Carson Ankeny (90%): I strongly believe that<br />the Fed will cut interest rates at the September<br />meeting. This is due to a variety of factors,<br />most importantly statements from the Fed Chairman<br />himself, as well as the pressing economic factors<br />that would cause the Fed to make that decision.<br />While there is a small chance that rates are<br />not lowered, most likely due to a conservative<br />and “safe” fiscal mindset that the Fed has<br />historically possessed under Chairman Powell, I<br />believe that the pressures on the Fed to act are<br />too great, and that there will be at least a small<br />decrease at the meeting on September 18th, leading<br />to incremental cuts at their remaining meetings<br />for the rest of the year.","Gracie Culpepper (75%): I'm putting mine very high<br />because based off of what the chairman said, I<br />really believe that they will lower the interest<br />rates. His last remarks seemed to hint that he was<br />interested in voting for them to go down, and most<br />websites I looked at were debating how much it<br />would drop by, not if it would drop at all.","Victor Avila (80%): I believe the FED will decide<br />to lower its rates at its September meeting with<br />an 80% probability. I came to these findings<br />through researching the history of the Federal<br />Interest Rates and how long they typically peak<br />and fall. Rates most recently peaked in August<br />2023 at 5.33. I then found a point in time with<br />similar rates and similar inflation (2.9). This<br />year was 2006. ⅘ similar scenarios have rates<br />peaking for about a year before the FED drops<br />rates. August 2024 makes a year that rates have<br />been steady at 5.33 as I anticipate them lowering<br />in September.","Corinne O'Dell (80%): Federal Reserve Chair Jerome<br />Powell strongly hinted that a cut is coming, and<br />many other financial analysists think the same.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): Given the current economic<br />conditions and the signals from the Federal<br />Reserve, I'd estimate the probability of the Fed<br />deciding to lower interest rates at its September<br />2024 meeting to be around 75%. This reflects a<br />strong likelihood, but not a certainty, as the Fed<br />remains cautious and data-dependent.","David Daniels (95%): This question has been nearly<br />answered prior to the date of the meeting. Federal<br />Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the<br />fed will likely make changes that lower interest<br />rates as indicated by his words, \"The time has<br />come for policy to adjust. The direction of<br />travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate<br />cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks.” Even without<br />this bombshell of information I would still be<br />in the 80-90 probability because of historical<br />baselines established with trends of inflation and<br />fed meetings.","John Mathis (90%): Well, unemployment has rose<br />to 4.3% when it was at a low of 1% last year,<br />according to McGregor McCance of University of<br />Virginia. Furthermore, according to the same<br />source, the Fed is satisfied with the 2% interest<br />rates it has recently achieved. So, because<br />interest rates are cooling and unemployment is<br />on the rise, it only makes sense for the Fed to<br />cut interest rates. All of this has led head of<br />the Fed Jerome Powell to say “the time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.” This, to me, hints<br />that the Chair of the Fed aims to cut interest<br />rates no matter what, but the size of those cuts<br />will depend on a lot of economic factors. While<br />Powell does not single-handedly decide the rate<br />adjustments, he is the head of the Federal Open<br />Market Committee, so I doubt he would say this<br />without certainty that the rest of the board will<br />back him up. Furthermore, more members of the<br />committee were seemingly open to cutting rates<br />back in July, and since pressure has only mounted<br />since then, I expect more and more members to be<br />on board with cutting rates. Given the historical<br />record of the Fed cutting interest rates with<br />rising unemployment and falling inflation rates<br />(historical record), as well as hearing it<br />straight from the mouth of the Fed Chair himself<br />(expert opinion), I can confidently say there is a<br />90% chance the Fed will cut rates in September.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (65%): After reading<br />articles and becoming slightly more informed on<br />the topic, a lot of experts have weighted in and<br />said that the feds will cut rates down by .25%. My<br />finance friend said that her professor explained<br />that probably won't happen because of the director<br />of the fed reserve, so I was slightly confused.<br />But after revising some of the information again<br />(and trusting my gut feeling which is probably not<br />a good idea) I'm going with 65.","Matthew Harvey (85%): There are a lot of factors<br />that are going into this decision. First and<br />foremost. The fed chair signals “Time Has Come”<br />for the September meeting. They are hinting at<br />cutting the interest rates on September the 18th.<br />The FOMC has also added in the previous July<br />meeting that all participants are supporting a<br />funds rate cut. Every news sources is saying that<br />the fed interest rate cut is highly likely. I<br />have hardly any doubt that this is going to occur.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Vikram Bharadwaj (99%): It is clear to me that<br />with the market predicting with a virtually 100%<br />consensus that rates are going to be cut, that<br />this event is going to occur. Both Powell and<br />many other higher-ups in the Federal Reserve have<br />strongly hinted at rate cuts, and nearly every<br />graphic and estimation shows that now is the time<br />for rate cuts.","William Willis (95%): The fact that we have an<br />unemployment rate that is trending higher than<br />usual, our inflation rate is relatively high,<br />looking at the history shows that we will have a<br />cut. I found all of the unemployment rates from<br />the last 20 years, the inflation rate from the<br />last 20 years, and the fed rates for the last 20<br />years, and then when the rate cuts occurred. I<br />looked at them all side by side and found a trend<br />in the numbers. Each rate cut had a trend of high<br />unemployment rate and low inflation rate. I also<br />looked up information and found the Jerome Powell<br />stated that the “time has come to cut rates”, to<br />CNBC. There for which great certainty with what<br />the numbers are telling me I gave it a probability<br />of 95%.","Minha Ahmad (75%): I would say that the<br />probability is 75% due to several expert opinions.<br />Forbes, Reuters, and Fortune are just some among<br />many networks that have reported predictions that<br />there will be cuts.","Leo Zegarra (85%): The federal reserve chair,<br />Jerome Powell, has already given a speech on<br />what will occur. He made it clear that \"the<br />central bank was poised to cut interest rates in<br />September\" (New York Times). That was on August<br />23rd. However, he did claim on July 31st that \"the<br />market needs to stay [the way that it is].\" For<br />that reason, there is some doubt. Realistically,<br />however, with it being closer to the 09/17 and<br />09/18 meeting date and with Powell not only<br />saying there will be a cut but also discussing<br />specifically how much of a cut there will be, I am<br />leaning more towards yes.","Reece Slater (88%): I looked at personal<br />interviews and speeches given by Jerome Powell<br />which indicate almost certainty that the fed will<br />cut rates. I also looked at data by traders which<br />indicate close to a 100% chance that the fed<br />will cut rates by September. All sources that I<br />investigated are almost certain that the fed will<br />cut rates, the question is just a matter of how<br />much and what the impacts will be.","Alex Vrolijk (80%): Inflation has continued to<br />drop closer to the target 2% goal as the federal<br />interest rates remain high at over 5%. The fed<br />was already considering lowering interest rates<br />at their July meeting but decided not to. It has<br />been stated that a vast majority of Fed officials<br />believe a cut is likely in the upcoming meeting.","Findleigh Ague (79%): Interest rates have been<br />raised 11 times since March 2022 to counteract<br />inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee<br />meets several times throughout the year to discuss<br />different topics such as interest rates, but so<br />far, they have declined to lower them. Although<br />this is true, inflation is currently at the lowest<br />rate (2.9%) that it has been since March 2021.<br />Additionally, the Consumer Price Index has fallen<br />to 3%, which is reflective of lower inflation<br />rates, as on average, consumers are paying less.<br />When the CPI fell, the Fed projected that interest<br />rates would be cut to 5.1% by the end of the year.<br />Also, the CME FedWatch tracker predicts that at<br />the FOMC's September 17th and 18th meeting, there<br />is a 69.5% chance that interest rates will be cut<br />to 5-5.25%. For these reasons, I think that it is<br />pretty likely that interest rates will be cut at<br />their meeting in the next few weeks.","Simon Gersten (10%): If inflation is persistently<br />above the Fed’s 2% target, the Fed is unlikely to<br />lower rates. Inflation has been persistently above<br />the 2% target and appears to be continuing to do<br />so."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.38,0.46999999999999997,0.81000000000000005],"y":[2.9675850599771367,0.99314672136679294,2.023677220661193],"text":["Crowd (38%)","Crowd (47%)","Crowd (81%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(TRUE,NA)","legendgroup":"(TRUE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will a Category IV (or<br />above) hurricane hit the<br />mainland US before Dec 1?","Will the US Federal<br />Reserve decide to lower<br />interest rates at its<br />September meeting?","Will UGA football be<br />undefeated in its regular<br />season?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will a Category IV (or<br />above) hurricane hit the<br />mainland US before Dec 1?","Will the US Federal<br />Reserve decide to lower<br />interest rates at its<br />September meeting?","Will UGA football be<br />undefeated in its regular<br />season?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"5682abb5fd0":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"56847aa4be":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"5682abb5fd0","visdat":{"5682abb5fd0":["function (y) ","x"],"56847aa4be":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
