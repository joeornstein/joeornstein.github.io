Because<br />of our winning streak when it comes to home games<br />if do lose a game it’s more likely to be an away<br />game. Furthermore, Florida has very strong players<br />and the home advantage so it’s very possible that<br />we lose that game.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (65%): I believe that although<br />much of my prediction is based on Stockton’s<br />performance I do think we could possibly lose one<br />game against Tennessee or possibly tech because<br />it is much later in the season. Given their<br />consistency, depth, and ability to step up in big<br />games at home, it’s reasonable to believe Georgia<br />has about a 65% chance to sweep all home games in<br />2025.","Alizah Mudaliar (40%): Although Georgia is<br />predicted to be a dominating team during its<br />away games, having a hard home game schedule,<br />improvements in other teams, and starting with<br />a new quarterback may provide some challenges in<br />winning every game. Homefield advantage may play<br />into this, but I think the hardest games for UGA<br />to win will be Florida and Tennessee.","Amanda Neighbour (22.6%): I believe the chance of<br />UGA winning all of our away games this upcoming<br />season is rather unlikely. The Bulldogs have a<br />home game win streak of 32, however, they lost to<br />Ole Miss and Alabama, as well as almost a third<br />time to Georgia Tech this previous season. I found<br />the average of the ESPN money lines and the match<br />up predictor percentages for each UGA away game in<br />the 2025 CFB Season. By averaging ESPN analytics<br />with betting odds, I incorporated a greater set<br />of data into my final prediction. Overall, based<br />on these factors, I estimate that UGA has around a<br />22% chance of winning every away game this season.","Anna Barton-Caucci (30%): I think there is a<br />30% chance that UGA wins all of the away games<br />because the probabilities of individual away<br />games against quality opponents or the opponents<br />that actually pose a threat to UGA (Florida and<br />Tennessee)averaged is around 60% and when you<br />multiply those together the odds are cut in half.","Anna Kneser (35%): There are 5 away games this<br />season, so I feel as though UGA is bound to lose<br />at least one of them. The games I am most worried<br />about are the Tennessee game and the Florida game.<br />UGA is known for their home field advantage with<br />having a long undefeated streak for home games. In<br />someone’s briefing, they said UGA is bound to lose<br />at least one game, and I think it is more likely<br />for them to lose an away game than a home game.<br />Based on the likelihood of UGA winning each game,<br />I calculated it and I think there is a 35% chance<br />they will lose at least one game.","Arshia Charkhian (45%): Georgia’s record<br />against the teams away from home has been solid<br />historically. Those teams have also not seen huge<br />upgrades during the offseason like Georgia has.<br />Tennessee will cause the most challenge since<br />Neyland is a hard place to travel to. Although the<br />UGA vs Tech is being played in Atlanta, there is<br />still strong support for the Bulldogs to the point<br />where it could be seen as a home game; the same<br />can be said about the Florida game.","Blake Martin (65%): While Georgia has shown to<br />be strong against these opponents in recent years<br />(The teams have not beaten us in 5+years) and<br />Kirby Smart's coaching is top-tier, there are<br />still challenges that I foresee as being issues<br />this upcoming season. New quarterbacks between<br />Auburn, Georgia and Tennessee spark uncertainty on<br />how each school will do. This is especially true<br />with our early-season matchup against Tennessee.<br />Auburns bye week and home field advantage also<br />could tip the scales in a close game. Florida<br />recently has improved talent and it being at a<br />neutral site could be a wildcard between the two.<br />Mississippi State and Georgia Tech might not seem<br />like big threats but unpredictable moments always<br />exist like when we played Ole Miss last season<br />and lost. In regards to Georgia Tech though, they<br />have not beaten us outside of Sanford Stadium<br />since 1999. I do not see that changing this year.<br />Given these, I'm optimistic but also cautious that<br />Georgia has a 65% chance of winning all their away<br />games this season.","Breanne Talley (40%): With a first-year<br />quarterback leading the way and a handful of<br />tough, emotional games ahead, Georgia is likely<br />to stumble at least once in its away schedule.<br />Whether it’s Florida in Jacksonville, Tennessee<br />in Knoxville, or a surprise upset against a<br />rival, the odds aren’t in favor of a flawless<br />road season. My forecast: Georgia goes 4–1 in away<br />games. My numbers come from taking the probability<br />of Georgia winning each game and multiplying them,<br />since it is a joint probability that they all win.<br />[Ten=.619]*[Aub=.913]*[Flor=.799]*[MS St=.973]*[Ga<br />Tech=.898]=[Probability of them winning all away<br />game=39.4%] I rounded up in my final answer for a<br />little bit of hope and uncertainty.","Caleb Lux (30%): After reviewing all of the<br />evidence, I am somewhat confident that UGA will<br />lose at least one of its away games this season.<br />While the chances of our victory for each game is<br />favorable, the uncertainty arising from Tennessee,<br />Florida, and potentially Auburn create enough<br />doubt to make it more likely than not that we will<br />lose at least one of those games. Specifically,<br />I assigned the following probabilities to win for<br />each game: State .97, Auburn .9, Tennessee .6,<br />Florida .6, Tech .95. This results in a 30% chance<br />that we win every game, thus my prediction.","Caroline Mattox (75%): Georgia has an extremely<br />tough schedule. Playing on the road in the SEC is<br />not an easy task no matter where you play. I think<br />there is a high chance that we lose an away game<br />this season. Florida alone presents an extreme<br />threat. I wouldn’t say any of these teams are<br />necessarily better than Georgia but I think there<br />is a very high chance that the fatigue sets in at<br />some point and we just get outplayed. Or maybe we<br />win a big game and the “we’ve got this” attitude<br />sets in and we just lose a game. I think we have<br />the capability to win every game we play but I am<br />nervous about the difficulty level of our schedule<br />and that’s why I have given a lower probability","Chris Haswell (60%): Most sports betting sites<br />have the Dawgs winning every away game. Some<br />experts predict Florida as being our only loss.<br />We've beaten Florida every year I've been here,<br />and I am confident in Gunner Stockton's abilities<br />based on the end of last season. It also feels<br />sacriligious to lose faith in the team, so I<br />predict a narrow Florida victory to cement our<br />away game dominance.","Cierra Green (40%): Of these games, the two<br />most concerning are Tennessee and Florida. When<br />researching various websites (ESPN, CBS, NY Times,<br />Online Athens, UGA Wire), each had different<br />opinions about these two games. However, even if<br />UGA were to win either one, the predicted ending<br />score was close (24 to 20 for GA v TN and 27 to<br />24 for GA v FL on two websites). Additionally,<br />DJ Lagway of Florida is projected to have a good<br />season. I believe it is very likely that Georgia<br />will win 4 of these games, but statistically, it<br />is unlikely that Georgia will win all 5. Using<br />joint probability, even if Georgia had a 90%<br />chance of winning each game, the probability would<br />only be 59% for winning all 5. Lowering those<br />chances for both Florida and Tennessee brings that<br />probability further down. I also asked my friends<br />(who are lifelong UGA fans) their opinion, and<br />they said UGA would lose at least one of these<br />games. One cited that Georgia has a track record<br />of underestimating certain teams and believes<br />we will lose to Mississippi State. Although not<br />professional opinions, their belief that Georgia<br />will lose a game despite their bias helped me in<br />this decision.","Elizabeth Nelson (23%): Courtesy of my football<br />obsessed boyfriend, I discovered ESPN's FPI win<br />probabilities for UGA's 2025 away/neutral site<br />regular season football games. As I learned in<br />class today, I found the joint probability by<br />multiplying each games' win probability. I think<br />23 is a safe guess because often Florida and<br />Georgia Tech are toss-up games, right at 50-50,<br />so it seems more in my favor that we will lose at<br />least one game on the road. I give Georgia a 23%<br />chance of winning all away and neutral site games<br />this regular season.","Folasade (Sade) Ezekiel (54%): Georgia has a good<br />track record of winning against every team they<br />will be playing away this season. Even though<br />our team will be starting a new quarterback,<br />the confidence is high that we will still have<br />a successful season. Our defense and offense<br />have great stats against these teams. The only<br />game that could potentially be an upset is the<br />Auburn game. This is because the Auburn game is<br />considered the oldest rivalry in the south, and<br />because both teams play each other very closely.<br />Many believe that the Jordan Harris stadium is<br />cursed, so playing there is also an intimidating<br />factor for a lot of teams. With that being said,<br />if we were to lose one game, the Auburn game would<br />be the one we might lose. I am still confident<br />that with Georgia's coaching and great athletes,<br />we will take home the win. Prediction = 54%<br />confident that we will win every away game!","Francesca Mariano (29%): Many of the briefs stated<br />that they think Georgia will loose at least one<br />of the away games. They emphasized the strength<br />and good record of Georgia, but also how games<br />can easily be upsets and we aren't positive<br />how many of the new players will pan out, on<br />Georgia's team and our opponents' teams. In the<br />the three years I have been a student at UGA, we<br />have had an incredible record, record breaking<br />records, of consecutive wins. I in no way claim<br />to be a football expert, but knowing how well we<br />typically perform and how well we are expected<br />to perform, I gave each away game a baseline of<br />80% of Georgia winning. With many of the briefs<br />saying we will loose at lease one, I decreased one<br />of the probabilities to 70%. I multiplied these<br />probabilities and got about 29% probability that<br />Georgia wins all their away games.","Gabriela Null (79%): While I do believe that<br />UGA will have a great season and away game track<br />record. I also think that there Is one game that<br />poses a threat. I have no doubt in my mind that<br />we will beat Tennessee, Auburn and the rest of the<br />away game schedule. I do think that Florida will<br />poses a threat. this game is always hard to gauge<br />due to the lack of home field advantage and the<br />new factor of our new quarterback. i think that<br />Florida has an amazing quarterback and that it<br />wouldn't surprise me if they ended up taking the<br />win. I think it also depends on how Gunner does in<br />these first few games. These elements end lessen<br />my confidence in winning all of the games. there<br />is a 21 percent chance that Florida might beat us<br />in my mind. But I do think we will win everyone<br />but possibly this one.","Hunter Murray (26.2%): I used the ESPN win<br />percentage, the ESPN money line, and my own<br />knowledge and research about each game to build<br />a probability tree. I then took the compound<br />probability directly from that tree. I feel like I<br />could be slightly more confident, but I also think<br />we face risks in the Florida, GT, and especially<br />Tennessee.","Jackson Bost (30%): Georgia, with a physical<br />offense and evergreen defense, will have wins<br />at Tennessee (.8) and Auburn (.8) thanks to<br />their inexperienced offenses, notch an all<br />but guaranteed win against a historically<br />poor Mississippi State (.95), likely defeat an<br />all-or-nothing Tech (.75) team, but may fall short<br />when facing a veteran Florida (.65) team with the<br />explosive DJ Lagway. While some analysts and Vegas<br />still favor Georgia, this game will be Georgia's<br />biggest hurdle. When multiplying each games'<br />probability, the probability that UGA football<br />will win all of their away games this regular<br />season is .3.","James Hunter Darke (60%): I predict that Georgia<br />will lose an away game this regular season with<br />about 60% confidence. While the dawgs will be<br />favored in every game, with the rigorous schedule<br />and venues, they will drop one game. I have a<br />lot of faith in them, but I think we will fall<br />to either Tennessee or Auburn in an absolute<br />shootout.","Jhaycee Barnes (40%): Georgia is talented enough<br />to be favored in every away game, but winning all<br />of them is tough. Auburn and Tennessee both have<br />strong home-field advantages, and Florida and Tech<br />can get unpredictable (as we saw last season).<br />Even if Georgia is the better team overall, the<br />odds of slipping up at least once feel higher than<br />them pulling off a perfect season away.","Kira Fleischer (40%): Taking into account the<br />briefings, it seems likely that UGA will win<br />MOST of the away games, however Florida poses a<br />significant challenge. Considering the UF game,<br />the possible difficulty of Auburn, and the unknown<br />skills of Gunner, I find it unlikely that UGA will<br />win every single away game.","Kristoffer Fields (80%): I believe that UGA will<br />lose an away game because there are too many away<br />games with too many formidable opponents. Also I<br />mathematically calculated all of my probabilities<br />by multiplying my confidence for each away game<br />and I was at around roughly 30% chance all of<br />the games are won by the University of Georgia.<br />Furthermore, the football team, while still an<br />elite contender, has gone down in popularity<br />and quality over the years, therefore I think it<br />is safe to say that it is more likely that the<br />football team loses at least one away game.","Liz Yancey (22%): I am 40% confident that UGA<br />will win every away game this regular season.<br />I looked up UGA's chance of winning/losing on<br />ESPN's Matchup Predictor. They all predicted that<br />UGA would win every away game. I then multiplied<br />every chance UGA would win and the result was .22,<br />which is why I think there's a 22% chance of them<br />winning every away game this regular season.","Manuv Amun Datta (60%): It is my belief that UGA<br />will not be successful in winning all of their<br />away games this season. I base this prediction<br />on the results of last season's performances.<br />There were various games last year in which UGA<br />struggled mightly with UNRANKED opponents. With<br />the strength of the current schedule, and the<br />amount of ranked opponents away, I find it likely<br />that UGA will struggle early in a game and not be<br />able to make a comeback. This loss will not remove<br />them from an opportunity at the college football<br />playoff.","Mateo Ceron (40%): I chose 40% because I had a<br />conversation with a couple of the people that did<br />briefings and realized that a majority of them<br />were pretty confident for most of UGA's schedule,<br />excluding one or two games. In class we also heard<br />from one of the people that did briefings AND<br />did the math for that specific person's thoughts,<br />which came out to about a 42% chance of winning<br />out for our whole away schedule, but only based<br />off one person's analysis (and that 42% chance was<br />optimistic). Therefore I decided I would subtract<br />a couple of percentage points to make up for any<br />biases in his percentage predictions and everyone<br />else's (because obviously we want our team to<br />succeed), and ended up at a 40% chance of winning<br />our whole schedule.","Nic Curtis (30%): To come up with my probability,<br />I assigned each game their own probability and<br />multiplied them together. .85 for Tennessee,<br />Auburn, and Georgia Tech, .55 for Florida, .95<br />for Charlotte and Mississippi State. I did this<br />because the question is a joint probability<br />question and each event is independent of each<br />other.","Owen Johnston (31.752%): I give GA a probability<br />0.7 of beating TN given that TN is a difficult<br />home environment, but they lost a lot of good<br />offensive players to the draft and have a brand<br />new, untested quarterback. I give GA a probability<br />of 0.9 to beat Auburn given that Auburn has<br />lost so many players to the portal and has poor<br />preseason prospects. I give GA a probability of<br />0.8 to beat FL due to the neutral site location<br />which eliminates home advantage and an improved<br />team, however, the FL quarterback missed a lot of<br />last season and has less experience. I give UGA<br />a probability of 0.9 to beat MS State. MS State<br />is last in the SEC and had a poor recruiting<br />record. Finally, I give GA a probability of<br />0.7 to beat Tech given the close game from last<br />season, however, it cannot be outweighed by<br />Tech's overall offensive line performance and<br />the fact that I think the game being played at<br />Mercedes-Benz stadium will benefit UGA. All of<br />these probabilities multiplied together give UGA<br />a 0.31752 probability of winning all of their away<br />games this season.","Paul Frilingos (22.5%): ESPN Analytics has<br />probabilities calculated on their website for<br />each game of the 2025 college football season.<br />This takes into account all factors related to<br />performance, like recruiting, transfers, and home<br />field advantage. Multiplying the probability that<br />Georgia wins each away game this season together<br />creates the joint probability of about 22.5%.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (27%): I read<br />my classmates’ briefings and asked ChatGPT to<br />break down the betting odds in order to calculate<br />the win probability for each game and then<br />calculate the overall chance of going undefeated<br />on the road. According to ChatGPT, based on the<br />information in the briefings, the chances of<br />winning are about 74% for Tennessee, 68% for<br />Auburn, 71% for Florida, 86% for Georgia Tech, and<br />close to 90% for Mississippi State. Multiplying<br />these gives around a 25–35% chance of winning them<br />all. As Hunter put it, Tennessee’s fast offense,<br />Auburn’s home-field advantage, and Florida’s<br />emerging quarterback make those games real risks.<br />So I think 4–1 is much more likely than winning<br />all the away games.","Reese Fabritius (25%): Using ESPN stats, UGA<br />has about a 6.5% chance of going undefeated<br />overall—this season. However, if you multiply the<br />probability that UGA will win each of its away<br />games (0.65, 0.7, 0.7, 0.8, 0.85) you get around<br />0.22. However, I think those numbers are slightly<br />inflated by preseason optimism, and UGA will be<br />more greatly favored as the season goes on.","Ruhi Doddamani (28%): I did the joint probability<br />calculation on all of the games, multiplied them<br />all up. I read through the briefs and tried to<br />familiarize myself with which games are most<br />likely to be the team's pitfall this season. I<br />think Florida presents the biggest challenge, just<br />by players' stats. I also looked at the betting<br />sites' numbers, and after accounting for their<br />inflated lines to get people to bet more, Fanduel<br />and Prizepicks are coming around the mid-20s range<br />as well. ESPN has a 22%. 28% UGA goes undefeated<br />is my most generous guess. Fingers crossed!","Ryan Marx (80%): The reason that i believe that<br />the Bulldogs will only have around an 80 percent<br />chance of winning every away and neutral ground<br />game comes down to what teams and are on the<br />schedule and the location at which they are being<br />played. Starting with those at home the difficult<br />games of the season are: Alabama who we lost<br />against 41-34 last year,Texas which was a close<br />call with Georgia only beating them 22 to 19 in<br />2024, and Finally there is Ole Miss which Georgia<br />also lost against in 2024 by an embarrassing 10<br />to 24. Furthermore our remaining games at home<br />are made up of lower ranked schools such as<br />Marshall(which lost to Georgia 13-3 back in 2004<br />and Austin Peay( which was absolutely crushed back<br />in 2018 by a whopping 45-0). Compared to the Away<br />and Neutral Schedule which makes up around 5 games<br />of the season the only two legitimate schools that<br />pose any threat to this challenge are Tennessee<br />who put up a slugging match that resulted in a<br />31-17 victory. and Auburn, a school that is a<br />bitter rival to Georgia and also narrowly lost<br />by 31 to 13 last year. Out of the 5 home Games I<br />believe that only Tennessee has any real chance<br />to beat Georgia, of course you always have the<br />home field advantage, something that Tennessee has<br />locked in while playing at Neyland, combine this<br />with the fact that Georgia has typically struggled<br />with Away Games and that Tennessee always puts<br />up a strong offense with Breakneck plays leads me<br />to believe that outside of the 80 percent chance<br />Georgia does win every away and neutral Game, then<br />there is a 20 percent chance that Georgia will<br />lose an away or neutral game","Sarah Kate Maher (54%): We've already beat the<br />teams on our away schedule, and though some of<br />them might be improving, they will not be at the<br />level that Georgia will be this year. The reason<br />my probability is so low is that we've been<br />suprised by how UGA plays before, and can never be<br />too sure, especially in trap games like MS State.<br />We also almost lost to GA Tech last year, and<br />Florida and Auburn are always tougher games.","Sasha Mahtani (35%): UGA has some fierce<br />competitors considering their away games, and I<br />am most worried about Auburn and Georgia Tech.<br />After today's briefings in class and learning<br />that Auburn's team has a decent outlook on their<br />season, I feel most threatened that they will beat<br />us. Considering our performance against Georgia<br />Tech last year and how we barely scraped by past<br />a win, there is some chance they will beat us<br />as well, especially considering their home base<br />advantage.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (67%): I believe UGA Football<br />will win all of their away games this season<br />primarily because of their away record. In the<br />past 5 seasons, UGA only lost 3 away games, 2 of<br />them last season. Those 2 teams are home games<br />this season, so the other teams are ones UGA is<br />known to beat. The closest matchup last year that<br />is an away game this year is Georgia Tech, and it<br />was under presiding quarterback Gunner Stockton's<br />substitution for Carson Beck that led us to<br />victory in the eight-overtime thriller. That being<br />said, it is extremely easy to lose a game for any<br />sort of reason, which is why I am optimistically<br />cautious- at 67%.","Sierra (80%): I think that Georgia will win<br />all away games this normal season. I am 80%<br />confident. I considered factors like recruitment,<br />transfers, distance to stadium, professional<br />opinions by sports predicting professionals,<br />effectiveness/character/newness of coaches, home<br />and away game advantage performance, historical<br />wins in matches (scores and wins), quarterback<br />performance, offence vs defense performance,<br />and the home game lineup (UGA home game lineup<br />is intense). I chose 80% as my confidence level<br />because I am only concerned about one game in the<br />normal season. I am concerned about UGA losing the<br />Tech game after their performance last year.","Zafar Ali (45%): Originally I believed that there<br />was little to no chance that the UGA football<br />team would be able to win every single away game.<br />However, based on the briefings and overall class<br />discussion, I have been swayed a little to the<br />idea that there is a more likely chance they will.<br />Based on the pervious 2024 season, UGA lost two of<br />the away games. Those being Ole Miss and Alabama.<br />Looking at this year's schedule, the teams they<br />will be playing do not seem as difficult as last<br />year. Florida seems to be the biggest challenge as<br />their quarter back is returning from the previous<br />season and has been noted to be performing quite<br />well. Aside from this, Gunner Stockton is now<br />taking the role as starter QB for this season.<br />We can't say for certain how well he will do,<br />however, he was able to help the team through<br />those games. I am not 100% on them winning because<br />there are multiple games rather than just one. We<br />have to account for each. However, to conclude, I<br />believe there is a 45% because I still think they<br />will at least lose one game."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.40000000000000002],"y":[1.0020307655679062],"text":"Crowd (40%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.52000000000000002],"y":[1.0415596690494566],"text":"Joe Ornstein (52%): It's a bit too early for<br />me to trust any of the point spreads listed on<br />the sportsbooks -- they all seem a touch too<br />conservative.
