In a majority of our games,<br />I felt that we were nearly guaranteed to win<br />at about 95% chance of winning. Our games with<br />Alabama and Texas dropped our chances considerably<br />as I felt we had a 40% and 50% chance of winning<br />respectively. Taking into account our record<br />against Alabama and Texas' new talent I felt these<br />were accurate, bringing the probability of going<br />undefeated to about 15%.","Brooke McDermott (80%): I reviewed the ESPN power<br />ranking chart that we talked about in class.<br />UGA was ranked 1st in their team strength, which<br />leads me to think they have a high probability<br />of doing extremely well in comparison to lower<br />ranked teams. However, their REM SOS is at a 3,<br />due to their schedule being relatively challenging<br />with teams like Bama and Texas on their docket.<br />However, with the loss of Saban this past season,<br />Alabama may falter, leaving Georgia more likely<br />to win. In contrast, a lot of sports analysts and<br />announcers have openly debated the Texas v. UGA<br />game and possibly the Alabama game as a potential<br />loss for UGA.","Joe Ornstein (11%): It's a much tougher schedule<br />than we've had the past two seasons, but as of Aug<br />25 we're favored to win every game. My estimate<br />is based on win probabilities implied by point<br />spreads, which tend to be very well calibrated<br />(teams cover the spread 50% of the time, with a<br />standard deviation of roughly two touchdowns).","Abby Crowe (10%): I believe that the University<br />of Georgia football team has a 10% chance of<br />going undefeated in the 2024 regular season. I<br />am basing this prediction on the College Football<br />Headquarters (CFB) odds for each individual game.<br />At a glance, UGA is favored to win every game,<br />with Alabama and Texas being the least certainty,<br />but after multiplying the probabilities against<br />each other to determine the likelihood, it no<br />longer looked too good. I landed on 9.7% chance<br />of winning all regular season games, but because I<br />love the dawgs, I’m giving them a 10% chance.","Simon Gersten (30%): To calculate the<br />probability of UGA going undefeated, I assigned<br />win probabilities for each of their games and<br />multiplied them together. Respective to their<br />schedule, probabilities of 90%, 95%, 95%, 75%,<br />75%, 99%, 99%, 80%, 95%, 99%, 90%, 99% would give<br />them a 30% chance of going undefeated.","Minha Ahmad (75%): UGA has gone three straight<br />seasons without losing a single regular season<br />game so it is very likely that they will go<br />undefeated this year as well. However, there is<br />still a bit of room for doubt which is why I am<br />not 100% sure. This season, they will be playing<br />major teams like Alabama, Texas, and Ole Miss on<br />their home turfs and not at UGA.","Haley Ford (56%): Yes- I got a probability of 56%.<br />I did a combination of equivalent bet test and<br />probability trees. I did the odds I would feel<br />most comfortable with, then used a probability<br />tree to see that likelihood. Initially- I took<br />safer odds but the probability seemed to low, so<br />I had to be more deterministic about the games<br />we would win. Clemson: 100 % (1.00) Tennessee<br />Tech: 100% (1.00) Kentucky: 100%(1.0) Alabama:<br />70% (0.70) Auburn: 100% (1.0) Mississippi State:<br />100% (1.00) Texas: 70% (0.70) Florida: 100%<br />(1.00) Ole Miss: 100% (1.00) Tennessee: 80% (0.80)<br />Massachusetts: 100% (1.00) Georgia Tech: 100%<br />(1.00)","Liv Payne (43%): I do not know much about<br />football, so I turned to the internet to figure<br />out the likelihood of UGA being undefeated. Coach<br />Kirby Smart has been at UGA since 2016. Before<br />2023, the Bulldogs had not gone undefeated since<br />1980. According to an article by Si.com, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated under Smart for<br />3 seasons in a row. Therefore, my prediction is<br />based upon Smart's performance as a coach. Out<br />of the 7 seasons that Smart has been coach, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated 3 seasons. 3/7=0.428<br />or rounded up to 43%.","Jeffrey Markowitz (30%): Georgia faces the ninth<br />toughest schedule against some very strong teams<br />on the road, in difficult atmospheres to play in.<br />While the Dawgs look great going into the season,<br />college football is unpredictable. Injuries or<br />other issues could occur that are unpredictable at<br />this point.","Jessica Armour (65%): Based on the scores from<br />last years football schedule, UGA did the best<br />over all in comparison to the other teams. It was<br />also the only team (other than alabama) to win all<br />of their away games. Since away games are where<br />people struggle the most and UGA was undefeated in<br />them I would say it is pretty likely that Uga will<br />be undefeated this season. However considering<br />after being unsuccessful in maintaining undefeated<br />last year, and losing some players there is still<br />a chance they will not be, hence why I did not<br />give a perfect score for the probability.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (80%): UGA has been<br />undefeated in the past three regular seasons,<br />so I believe that winning a 4th season is not<br />an extreme idea. A CBS article by Will Backus<br />states that Georgia has the possibility of being<br />undefeated in its 2024 regular season. I consulted<br />my friend (who is an avid college football fan),<br />and he believes the possibility is there, but<br />Georgia will need to step up and prepare itself.<br />Some of the season games will be challenging, but<br />Georgia has the roster to do it.","Carson Ankeny (30%): While I do feel that the UGA<br />Football team has the roster and coaching staff<br />that could lead to an undefeated season, it is<br />still statistically unlikely that UGA could win<br />each of its most difficult matchups. Looking at<br />the schedule, there are several tough matchups,<br />including Texas and Alabama. Losing any one of<br />these or other difficult matchups would lead<br />to the forecast being broken, and I don't feel<br />confident that the Dawgs would win all of these<br />matchups, even if I expect their final record to<br />be 11-1.","Hayden Morehouse (55%): UGA is the best team<br />in college football this year. However, I have<br />been a fan for a long time, and it is tough to<br />have a perfect season. Most sports pages have<br />us projected to go undefeated, but I am a bit<br />sheepish. Things like injuries or just simply<br />a bad game can happen. We also have a tougher<br />schedule with playing Ole Miss, Texas, and Alabama<br />away.","Kira Liscombe (10%): I used the Sports Illustrated<br />predictions for each game on Georgia's 2024<br />football schedule. I converted the percentages<br />to decimals and multiplied them together. I came<br />up with a probability of 9.4, but based on other<br />articles predicting the Georgia football season, I<br />decided to predict a bit higher at 10.","Colin Barry (60%): The Bulldogs currently have<br />their projected win total set at +/-10.5, meaning<br />the consensus opinion is that they are likely to<br />lose a game. This comes from a tough schedule and<br />a newly expanded playoff system that leaves them<br />with much more room for error and makes them more<br />accepting of a single loss. This loss could come<br />from one of our powerhouse matchups at Alabama,<br />Texas, or Ole Miss, or could come from a trap<br />game no one sees coming (see Auburn last year,<br />or anytime we've played South Carolina at noon<br />for reference). That is why i think that the odds<br />Georgia goes undefeated are still slightly more<br />likely than not at around 60%, as even with all<br />these changes this season they are still the best<br />team in football.","Franco Bravo (25%): After talking to multiple<br />sources and friends who know a good amount of<br />college football, I believe that UGA will lose<br />at least 1 game in the season. The season is<br />unpredictable and with Big Name teams like Texas<br />and Alabama, I believe that UGA will fall to<br />at least one of those teams. Additionally, like<br />last season, UGA is also capable of getting into<br />unnecessary close games that have no reason being<br />that close and some can argue that those wins came<br />with some skill but also some sort of luck.","Corinne O'Dell (9.25%): Based on the win<br />probabilities for each individual game that UGA<br />will play, you can multiply those together to<br />get an overall probability. It is relatively low<br />because with us playing Alabama and Texas in a<br />regular season game, it is very unprecedented so<br />the games are currently predicted to be toss ups.l","Shayna Van Glish (8.9%): (Detailed in much more<br />length in the briefing I completed for this<br />question) I think that there is a 8.9% chance that<br />the Bulldogs go undefeated in the regular season<br />due to the fact that they have a tough away game<br />schedule, injuries that will occur, and a team<br />that has a lot of new players working to mesh well<br />with the returnees. While this number is fairly<br />low, my overall predictions for each game are<br />fairly high, yet not guaranteed wins for many.","Vikram Bharadwaj (37.5%): In the past 24 year,<br />only one team ranked number one in the preseason<br />polls has won 2 or more highly ranked (top 10)<br />away games, with the five others losing one or<br />both of these matchups. If we ignore this and look<br />at just 3 ranked away games, the record goes up<br />to 2/7, or about 28.6%. Now being a bit generous<br />here, we can round that up to 37.5, given that<br />UGA has done well in the past and is the betting<br />favorite in all three high ranked road games.","Abigail V. Harris (1%): I used the Sports<br />Illustrated power index ratings for the UGA<br />2024 regular season lineup. I multiplied the<br />chance the Bulldogs won each game by the chance<br />they would win the next game and so on and so<br />forth until I had factored in their chance of<br />winning all 12 games in a row. In the end I got<br />a .096409641377167/10 chance that the Dawgs go<br />undefeated. Out of 100 thats .96409641377167, so<br />I rounded up and estimated their probability of<br />going undefeated would be about 1/100.","Findleigh Ague (68%): I don’t know a ton about<br />football, but I tried my best to read up on what<br />the vibes are with UGA’s schedule this season.<br />There are definitely going to be some tough<br />games this season, but I think that perhaps not<br />making it to the national championships last<br />year after winning back to back could be a strong<br />motivator for the team and lead them to victory<br />in the regular season. I also looked at ESPN’s<br />Football Power Index, and not all of the data<br />points directly applied to going undefeated in the<br />regular season, but in general it looks as though<br />their simulations that they conducted had UGA<br />winning a lot.","Gracie Culpepper (37%): Alabama will be a tough<br />game for the Dawgs. We historically have very<br />close games with them, and on top of that their<br />game this season will be in Tuscaloosa. For<br />football teams, it is more difficult to win<br />the game if they are not in their home stadium.<br />Because of this, I think that it is more unlikely<br />that UGA will have an undefeated regular season<br />with this game added into their schedule.","Alexis Frazer (65%): I started with the baseline<br />probability of going undefeated, then factored<br />into account each team's probability of beating<br />UGA. Taking into account Georgia's records in<br />the 3 most recent years, the probability of going<br />undefeated would be greater than any other SEC<br />team. The Alabama game could go unfavorably (based<br />off the SEC champ game last season), however,<br />because they lost their head coach and multiple<br />starters, Bama's likelihood of beating UGA is<br />lower this year than last. UT is not going to be<br />a problem given it is their first year in the SEC,<br />so on, so forth, until I came to 65%.","Erin Ho (5%): The reason I chose this estimate<br />is because I looked up UGA’s upcoming football<br />games and made my own estimate based on what I<br />knew about UGA and what I knew about the teams we<br />were playing. I multiplied all the values I made,<br />because this is what I think are our chances of<br />winning consecutively, no possibilities of losing<br />at all. I initially thought of 78%, because that’s<br />the median for all the percentages, but this<br />seemed more correct to me.","Reece Slater (22%): I first examined all preseason<br />#1 ranked college football teams since 1990 and<br />looked at the frequency of an undefeated regular<br />season. First I did SEC only teams, which was<br />33.3%, then I looked at all teams which was 40.9%.<br />I then used the tree branch (visualization) method<br />and multiplied all of the probabilities that UGA<br />would win each game according to ESPN Analytics.<br />This gave me a probability of 8.7% that UGA goes<br />undefeated. I then used the equivalent bet test<br />to find where my gut feels in the middle of this<br />data. This brought me to my conclusion of 22%<br />probability.","Leo Zegarra (60%): Although it may seem very<br />unlikely given the schedule this year, I believe<br />that the dawgs will go undefeated mainly due to<br />their depth. Because injuries occur so often in<br />football and teams are usually held back from<br />their potential as result, UGA simply shines<br />in the aspect of roster depth. Obviously, Kirby<br />Smart and his coaching staff is also exceptional,<br />meaning that this season will be backed up by<br />great minds and a great Carson Beck. Plus, 15<br />dawgs were named to the all SEC team, including<br />numerous offensive linemen, which are key to<br />allowing a great QB work his magic. Plus, UGA<br />has great defensive players who were named, which<br />prevents easy scoring. All in all, the teams they<br />are facing aren't as strong, especially when you<br />look at Alabama, who lost their head coach and<br />three outstanding players to the transfer portal.","Matthew Harvey (75%): My reasoning behind<br />assigning this number involves several factors<br />including my confidence level, regular season<br />games, starting rosters of the UGA, as well as<br />starting players for other teams. UGA is rated,<br />according to the Football Power Index, to be the<br />favorites to win the SEC as well as being the<br />favorites to make it to the National Championship<br />game as well. This index should let alone give<br />UGA a 50% chance of success in the regular season.<br />However, the issue is that other teams that are in<br />the top 5 likely teams to have a chance of winning<br />the national championship are among the teams UGA<br />has to play in the regular season. They are both<br />away games which also are historically shown to be<br />more difficult for away teams to win if the games<br />are determined to be contested. Therefore I am<br />confident this puts UGA directly between 100% and<br />50%.","Rommy Etzion (0%): The real question is what<br />are the odds Georgia is going to lose 1 game.<br />According the predictions made by \"Dawn of the<br />Dog,\", there are 3 games they are expected to<br />lose. So the question is if there's a probability<br />they win instead of lose. According to the<br />websites predictions, there is an expected game<br />where the dogs lose 52-17 and another 38-12. If<br />calculating the probability that UGA turns it<br />around, it would be very low. Going undefeated is<br />incredibly hard and statistically, based on expert<br />predictions, unlikely. A single loss means they<br />would not have an undefeated record, and there<br />are 3 predictions of a loss. Sorry to sound like a<br />pessimist, I also don't know much about football.","Alex Vrolijk (60%): I chose 60% because while I<br />believe UGA is one of the if not the best team<br />going into the upcoming season, we have some<br />difficult away games. The away games I am most<br />worried about are the Alabama and Texas games<br />because Alabama has had a lot of roster changes<br />and Texas is predicted to be a very strong team.","David Daniels (10%): To put my conclusion shortly,<br />no. After referring to resources made available<br />to the public (these including professional<br />sports analyzers, and betting odds) it becomes<br />apparent that the probability of some games<br />(let alone the whole) is less than a coin flip.<br />Considering that there are 12 games in the<br />regular season, someone without any college<br />football would deduce that the probability is<br />simply 0.5^12 equaling roughly 0.024%. However,<br />some of these games are not a coinflip. A decent<br />portion of the games in our conference have UGA<br />favored significantly. Sport analysts essentially<br />dismiss all games with exception to a few, Ol<br />Miss Texas, and Alabama. In these games we are<br />also the favored team. Projected Outcomes 2024<br />Schedule: 1. Clemson Georgia's odds: 82.3%<br />2. Tennessee Tech Georgia's odds: 99.0% 3. at<br />Kentucky Georgia's odds: 88.0% 4. at Alabama<br />Georgia's odds: 59.1% 5. Auburn Georgia's odds:<br />88.4% 6.

Tennessee Georgia's odds: 79.4%<br />11. UMass Georgia's odds: 99.0% Figures for<br />GA Tech game 12 not available. This is what It<br />would look like to crunch these numbers: Total<br />Probability=0.823×0.990×0.880×0.591×0.884×0.939×0.524×0.853×0.788×0.794×0.990<br />Totaling in a rough probability of 9.716%, or a<br />10 on a scale from 1-100. Give these numbers it<br />is not likely that UGA will go undefeated in the<br />regular season despite being the favorites.","John Mathis (45%): I used the equivalent bet<br />test to get a read on my gut feeling, and I would<br />rather get 1000 dollars if they go undefeated<br />than guessing on a slightly weighted coin flip.<br />Furthermore, I looked at individual game win<br />chances and weighted my answer based on that."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.40000000000000002,0.52000000000000002,0.34999999999999998,0.75,0.69999999999999996,0.81999999999999995,0.20000000000000001,0.19,0.14999999999999999,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.66000000000000003,0.25,0.10000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.13,0.72999999999999998,0.23000000000000001,0.84999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.17999999999999999,0.69999999999999996,0.73999999999999999,0.65000000000000002,0.59999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.050000000000000003,0.20000000000000001,0.65000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.60999999999999999,0.75,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.84499999999999997,0.90000000000000002,0.75,0.80000000000000004,0.80000000000000004,0.75,0.94999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.65000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.98999999999999999,0.94999999999999996,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.88,0.80000000000000004,0.79000000000000004,0.10000000000000001,0.80000000000000004],"y":[0.99083848090376703,0.99572645637672397,0.97092144703492522,0.96297729669604448,1.0229066903004422,1.0134299473604187,1.0478213785914705,1.0159780591959133,0.97103637487161909,1.0427994481055065,1.0388092863606289,1.031768455915153,1.0229412525193766,1.047662018169649,1.0292811176273973,0.9839417612412944,1.0417811447288841,1.0069354791659861,1.0068626651540398,0.97834373775403949,0.97610857542604212,0.95392813254147768,1.044735272298567,1.0029196449089794,1.0245559667469935,1.0260182173224166,1.0323967394419014,0.98043909599073231,1.012875027442351,1.0015956418123095,1.0180839798646049,1.0468347002752125,1.9616768348030746,1.9722894281614571,1.960500473389402,2.0488585254410281,2.0403955969959497,2.0491420860402285,2.0275779031915588,1.9968288567848504,1.9969011188717558,2.0090339938178658,2.0082351008430122,1.9939244445879012,1.9726441865321249,1.9934537732508033,2.0159184435382485,2.0014625844080003,1.9626476459670812,1.9995560475392267,1.9850050166016444,1.968975302297622,2.0027493122732265,2.0450722988694907,1.9577361427014695,2.043703278200701,1.9917850370984524,1.9926353378221393,2.0081539385719225,1.995967006799765,1.9993337760213763,1.9859841138357297],"text":["Joe Ornstein (40%): In all of the 20th century,<br />there were only 19 years when a Category IV or<br />higher storm made landfall on the mainland US<br />(according to NOAA). Then during the first 15<br />years of the 21st century, there was only *one*<br />such year (Hurricane Charley in 2004). This is a<br />pretty low base rate. But since 2016, 5 out of 8<br />years have seen a Category IV storm make landfall<br />in the US! The key question here is whether we<br />should consider this the \"new normal\", or if we<br />should expect some regression to the mean. I will<br />split the difference between these two views.","Corinne O'Dell (52%): Based on the past fifty<br />years, there have been 9 hurricanes in the US that<br />have been a category 4 or above. Using this and<br />factoring the NOAA's predicitions for major storms<br />this upcoming season, there is a toss up chance<br />for a category 4 or above hurricane to hit.","Ryan Foley (35%): Only 23% of hurricanes in the<br />2010s that hit the mainland were category 4 or<br />above. Currently, in the 2020s we are at 25% for<br />category 4 landfalls. Combining this with the fact<br />that we are projected to have a more active than<br />average hurricane season, I concluded that 35%<br />would be feasible as it is still unlikely but not<br />quite as much as 25%.","Erin Ho (75%): I chose this estimate was because I<br />had looked at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br />Administration’s hurricane reports. Based on<br />the records from the NOAA, in years where they<br />predicted an above-normal season, there was a<br />Category IV or above hurricane. Examples are<br />Hurricane Laura in 2020 (Category IV), Hurricane<br />Ida in 2021 (Category IV), and Hurricane Ian<br />(Category IV). In May of this year, the NOAA<br />predicted we would have an above-normal season<br />for 2024. As of the end of August, we have already<br />had one tropical storm, and two hurricanes make<br />landfall in the US.","Abby Crowe (70%): I predict that there is a 70%<br />chance of a category IV or above hurricane hitting<br />the mainland United States before December 1st.<br />This prediction is based on predictions from<br />the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association<br />(NOAA) for this storm season, as well as a cross<br />comparison to previous years, their weather<br />patterns, and former NOAA predictions. (This is<br />the introduction to my brief)","Alexis Frazer (82%): Rising temperatures and<br />the consistency over the past 3 years of 1 or<br />more stage IV hurricanes striking mainland US<br />makes it very probable for a stage IV hurricane<br />to hit this year. They typically occur from<br />august-october, and are even more likely if<br />temperatures are abnormally high. The national<br />oceanic and atmospheric assosciation predicted its<br />likelihood to be 85% or higher. I calculated the<br />probability based off of data from recent years<br />and meteorologists general consensus on the issue.","Carson Ankeny (20%): Looking only at hurricanes<br />since the year 2000, it is fairly rare that a<br />category 4 storm makes landfall on the mainland<br />as a category 4. By my count, there were only<br />6 storms that made contact as a category 4 or<br />above according to the National Hurricane Center<br />and NOAA. That means that 6/24 years since 2000,<br />there was a category 4 to hit the mainland, which<br />would be a 25% chance. However, since hurricane<br />season starts in June, and we are already in<br />August (and nearly September), I think that the<br />window is closing a bit. For that reason, I marked<br />the probably slightly lower than that data would<br />suggest, at 20%.","Brooke McDermott (19%): La Niña is predicted to be<br />much more intense this coming season. Water in the<br />Atlantic is reportedly at record warmth, and in<br />addition to this, the West African Monsoon winds<br />are reportedly extremely high this season. These<br />in combination with other environmental factors<br />influencing climate change and the atmosphere,<br />there is a much higher chance that the East Cost<br />and Gulf Shore of the US may experience more<br />intense hurricane such as a Cat 4 or 5. This being<br />said, I'm unsure if the hurricane will actually<br />hit land at a Cat 4 or 5. We have seen a Cat<br />5 hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, hit the US Gulf<br />Coast this year. And with increasing intensity in<br />weather trends, it wouldn't be out of left field<br />for another large hurricane to hit the mainland.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): I think regardless of<br />any research you do this question is a tossup.<br />However, I put my probability at 15% for these<br />reasons. Since August of 2020 three category four<br />hurricanes have hit the US mainland. The last<br />one being in September of 2022. This means the<br />probability should be higher right? The reason I<br />put it so low is because my research shows that<br />August and September are the busiest months for<br />hurricanes. Three of the last four of these things<br />have hit in August, which is essentially over.<br />Giving us one more month to have a real shot at a<br />hurricane as big as category 4.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): The National Oceanic<br />and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an<br />above-normal hurricane season due to factors like<br />record-warm sea surface temperatures. 14-21 storms<br />are to occur, with 2-5 major hurricanes coming<br />from these (Cat 3 or higher). Given this forecast,<br />I think the probability of one of these hitting<br />the US mainland as a Cat 4 or higher is 25.","Minha Ahmad (60%): This year there have been<br />record breaking warm ocean temperatures, and the<br />NOAA has forecasted that there will be 4-7 major<br />hurricanes with a 3, 4, or 5 category rating<br />in the Atlantic in 2024. The last Category 4<br />hurricane was Hurricane Ida in 2021, however,<br />because 4-7 major hurricanes are predicted to hit<br />the US this year, I think that there is a high<br />chance a category 4 hurricane will be among them.","William Willis (66%): I believe that there is<br />a 66 probability that there will be a category<br />4 hurricane hit by December 1 of this year. The<br />reason behind by confidence is that the latest one<br />of these hurricanes has ever hit was November. I<br />did a little bit of research on the likely hood<br />of it happening and each weather website said<br />that warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea<br />could result in a hurricane. Also other factors<br />such as reduced vertical wind shear and weaker<br />tropical Atlantic trade winds.","Simon Gersten (25%): The current NOAA forecast<br />predicts an 85% chance of an above-normal<br />hurricane season, with 4-7 major hurricanes<br />expected this year. Given that the season is<br />likely to favor strong hurricanes, there is<br />significant likelihood of a Cat 4 or cat 5<br />hurricane occurring. Historically, the U.S.<br />mainland is hit by a Cat 4 or above hurricane<br />every 2-3 years, and given the other conditions,<br />the likelihood is higher than an average year, but<br />still not extremely likely.","Vikram Bharadwaj (10%): While in the past 24<br />years there have been six total hurricanes to have<br />hit mainland US at a category 4 or higher level,<br />four of them were either at the very beginning<br />of September or middle of August. Seeing as how<br />the NOAA gives a 20% chance of a storm forming in<br />the next two weeks, I chose to exclude those four<br />hurricanes, giving us a 2/24 = ~8% rounding that<br />up to 10 percent.","Kira Liscombe (60%): Firstly, I confirmed that the<br />Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from Sat, Jun 1,<br />2024 – Sat, Nov 30, 2024, which means we are in<br />the peak of the season. I learned that Hurricane<br />Idalia was the only U.S. landfalling hurricane<br />in 2023, and it made landfall as a category-3<br />hurricane. This gave me some doubts about how<br />likely we were to receive a category 4 this year.<br />However, I also found that NOAA’s outlook for the<br />2024 Atlantic hurricane season predicts an 85%<br />chance of an above-normal season. Considering all<br />of this i ended up with a probability of 60, since<br />there is high likeleiedhood of an active season<br />this year but low historical frequency of Cat. 4<br />landfalls.","Gracie Culpepper (40%): I'm putting my answer<br />higher for a few reasons. The first is that<br />we have 2 months left of hurricane season and<br />have already had 2 Cat-4 hurricanes since 2021<br />alone. The second is that we are in the midst<br />of a La Nina year, which makes it more likely<br />to experience turbulent weather in the Atlantic<br />Ocean. My third reason is that the NOAA's<br />prediction for this year is that hurricane season<br />may be one of the busiest on record. For these<br />reasons, I'm putting it at 40% likely to happen.","Haley Ford (13%): NOAA reports: 79% of La<br />Niña, 90% above normal season and 70% chance<br />in August/October. 8/13 storms are forecasted<br />to be hurricanes, 4-7 major hurricanes with a<br />confidence of 70%. So, I did 79%+70% /2. Then *<br />70% confidence * .25 for my guess of what chance a<br />hurricane would be 4 if it was any category.","David Daniels (73%): After extensive research<br />from weather forecast professionals, historical<br />data, and the equivalency test, I have concluded<br />a favorable probability of a Category 4 or greater<br />hurricane making landfall prior to December 1st<br />in the USA. Weather experts estimate a rough<br />probability of .70 that these circumstances prove<br />true. Likewise, in the last 7 years alone, 6<br />hurricanes have met this criteria. lastly weather<br />patterns such as La Niña and El Niño positively<br />impact the probability of a hurricane to our<br />requirements. All of these factors considered, I<br />give a probability of .73 in favor.","Edward L Tsui (23%): According to the National<br />Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane<br />Center, only two category IV and one category<br />V hurricane hit the U.S between 2011 and 2020.<br />With only being in this modern decade three to<br />4 years, there have already been two category IV<br />hurricanes. The 3 out of 19 total hurricanes in<br />the first decade leads to a 0.158 probability in<br />the decade. However, The official NOAA predicts an<br />above-normal Atlantic hurricane season with rising<br />temperatures. Thus I about 1.5X the previous<br />probability to account for weather patterns<br />increasing in temperature this season. The most<br />frequent months for hurricanes happen by September<br />but the season lasts until about November.","John Mathis (85%): 6 out of the past 7 years have<br />had at least one Cat 4 or above, with some years<br />having multople, which would be a base rate of<br />around 85%. Furthermore, we seem to be in a La<br />Nina year, which makes conditions for hurricanes<br />more favorable. NOAA lists the following factors<br />that would also increase the likelihood of a CAT<br />4: Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean<br />Sea. Reduced vertical wind shear. Weaker tropical<br />Atlantic trade winds. An enhanced west African<br />monsoon. Even Last year, during a very strong<br />el Nino year we had a cat 4, and due to rising<br />global average temperatures, I see no reason for<br />this to all of a sudden make a switch on a year<br />with more favorable conditions. You have to go<br />back to 2016 to find a La Nina year where aCat 4<br />did not hit the mainland US, and I theorize that<br />this was due to Hurricane Matthews path that year,<br />which went over Haiti, Grand bahamas, AND cuba<br />before reaching south carolina, giving ample time<br />and land for the storm to dissipate. This was<br />also during a weak la Nina year without the other<br />favorable conditions.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (20%): I think that<br />before hurricane season ends, we will see a<br />category 4 hurricane. However, I don't think it<br />will hit mainland US as a category 4. I looked<br />at the previous hurricanes seasons this season<br />has been compared to (1878, 1926, 1998, 2010,<br />and 2020) and only 2 were category 4 when they<br />hit mainland US. The season has been quite so far<br />because of the Atlantic Nina.","Rommy Etzion (18%): In June, the beginning of the<br />season, forecasters reported in high confidence<br />that it’s predicted to be a busy above-average<br />season (85%), with about 4-7 major hurricanes.<br />There are near-record warm temperatures, less wind<br />shear in the Atlantic which allows hurricanes to<br />intensify, and an abundant oceanic heat content<br />in the tropical Atlantic which creates more energy<br />to fuel developments. That being said, its been<br />eerily quiet in the Atlantic this month, which<br />was unexpected to forecasters, and has strayed<br />from their original forecast. This is significant<br />because August is the 2nd most active month,<br />following September. This shows that so far,<br />the forecasters overestimated the season. This<br />development significantly lowers my prediction.","Abigail Harris (70%): First I looked up some<br />of the national statistics on how likely<br />administrations thought it would be that the<br />mainland US would be hit by a major hurricane.<br />The average of those predictions came around to<br />about 60% (inflated by including CAT 3s). Every<br />three years approximately 2 major (CAT 3 or above)<br />hurricanes hit the mainland US, or it's about<br />66.67% likely. In the last 4 years, 3 major storms<br />(CAT 4 or above for my purposes) have hit the<br />mainland US at about a 75% likeliness. However,<br />I wanted to balance longterm data trends and<br />shortterm conditions by choosing a middle ground<br />that accounts for an expert prediction (unreliable<br />this far out) of about 60%. Thus, I went sightly<br />for the lower side by picking 70/100, 5 pts down<br />from the higher trend, 3-4pts from the lower.","Matthew Harvey (74%): According to Wikipedia<br />which has decent data regarding this particular<br />question, the 3 most prominent months where a<br />category 4 hurricane manifests are in August,<br />September, and October. The rough estimate of the<br />amount that have been quantified within these 3<br />months are roughly 140. The amount of category<br />4’s that have hit the mainland are around 84<br />roughly. Therefore, if you were to use the total<br />amount of category 4’s to hit landfall and put<br />that over the total amount of cat 4’s between July<br />and November being 147 you get a probability of<br />around 57%. However this takes data from in the<br />1850’s and before the Saffir-Simpson scale was<br />invented which took place in 1971. The new number<br />of landfall hurricanes is now 39 as opposed to the<br />84 previously. The amount of category 4 hurricanes<br />since 1971 has been 61. Therefore the new<br />statistic I am going with is around 63% likely.<br />The NOAA predicts that 2024 will have an above<br />normal hurricane season for 24 with putting there<br />odds around 85% likely to have an abnormal season.<br />I am going to take the mean of there score and<br />mine and put it at about a 74% likely chance we<br />will see a category 4 hurricane hit the mainland.<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Category_4_Atlantic_hurricanes<br />https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season","Colin Barry (65%): I would say that it is more<br />likely than not that a category 4 or greater<br />hurricane will make landfall in the U.S. this<br />hurricane season. The Atlantic Ocean Basin is<br />projected to be incredibly active this hurricane<br />season due to factors like increased sea surface<br />temperatures, weaker Atlantic trade winds, and<br />and enhanced west African monsoon. The season has<br />already seen the fastest formation of a category 5<br />ever with Hurricane Beryl, even if it didn't make<br />landfall. These factors point to a very active<br />hurricane season which i think has a 65% chance of<br />a category 4 or greater storm making landfall.","Reece Slater (60%): Looked at NOAA data. Looked at<br />historical hurricane data. Very high air and water<br />temperatures and El Nino/La Nina activity.","Leo Zegarra (70%): Based off of recent years,<br />there's a higher average of Category 4 hurricanes<br />hitting the mainland. The last time one hit was<br />in 2022 and they are said to hit the mainland once<br />every 3 years. Plus, there is a really high chance<br />of La Niña happening in September, which is said<br />to increase the likelihood of major hurricanes,<br />which include Category 4 hurricanes. Plus, the<br />climate in recent years has been historically<br />higher compared to years prior, which boosts the<br />probability. Plus, there is a higher probability<br />of hurricanes occurring is in the next couple<br />of months, which fits in the timeline of before<br />December 1st. Also, what is scarier than a<br />hurricane hitting the mainland is a hurricane not<br />hitting the mainland for a while. So, I am fairly<br />confident that a category 4 will hit the mainland<br />before December 1st.","Jeffrey Markowitz (75%): Hurricanes and other<br />tropical storms are becoming very common.","Liv Payne (85%): NOOA says that \", a typical<br />season will yield 14 named storms, of which<br />seven become hurricanes and three become major<br />hurricanes.\" However, this season seems to be more<br />extreme due to higher temperatures and heavier<br />rain, so they predict at 90% that this season<br />will yield above-normal results. Also, category<br />4 hurricanes hitting land seem to be increasing,<br />with 2 (Franklin and Idalia) hitting land in<br />2023. Therefore, I think it is highly likely that<br />another cat 4 hurricane will hit.","Alex Vrolijk (5%): This is because on average only<br />2 hurricanes hit mainland US per year, and we are<br />already halfway through the hurricane season. It<br />is also rare for a cat 4 or above Hurricane to<br />hit the mainland. However, there have been cat<br />4+ hurricanes that have hit US mainland in recent<br />years including in 2017, 2018, and 2022. Although<br />it is not impossible for a cat 4+ hurricane to hit<br />the mainland before Dec. 1st (with September being<br />the most active month), it is highly unlikely.","Jessica armour (20%): Based on past years, there<br />has only been a handful of Cat. 5 hurricanes to<br />hit U.S. soil, therefore it is very unlikely that<br />one will hit by Dec 2. With that being said, it<br />would be more likely that a hurricane within a<br />lower category would hit U.S. soil because they<br />are more common in occurrence than those of Cat. 5","Franco Bravo (65%): After doing several research<br />the last couple days and also talking a family<br />member who is involved in weather and climate in<br />Jamaica, he told me that it is pretty probable<br />for their to be a cat 4 storm. Also in the last 10<br />years it has happend more than half the time, so<br />hence the reason why I chose 65.","Jeffrey Markowitz (95%): Every single indicator is<br />pointing towards the Fed lowering interest rates.<br />The Federal Reserve has held multiple meetings to<br />discuss it, and it is very public that they will<br />lower interest rates for the first time since<br />2020.","Joe Ornstein (95%): Jay Powell's speech at Jackson<br />Hole last week was an unambiguous signal that the<br />Fed Board of Governors plans to announce cut rates<br />at its September meeting. Futures markets on the<br />Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Fedwatch) suggest<br />that investors are only uncertain about *how<br />much* rates will be cut, not whether they will be<br />cut. There is still an inflation report scheduled<br />to be released by BLS a few days before the Fed<br />meeting, so I'm allowing for the possibility that<br />an unexpectedly bad report causes the Fed to hold<br />off rate cuts until after the November election.","Ryan Foley (95%): Recently Jerome Powell implied<br />that a cut is rates is coming during a speech<br />at Jackson Hole. He stated, \"The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.\" This appears to be him<br />telling Americans that cuts are coming and chances<br />are they will be during this upcoming September<br />meeting.","Jessica armour (61%): Based on my math of how<br />economy stimulation has decreased from 2023-2024<br />and knowing that the economy needs stimulation<br />in order to thrive, and also based on the trends<br />of inflation rates it is not likely that the<br />inflation rates will continue to rise and will<br />rather decrease even if by a minute amount in<br />order to ensure stimulation of the economy.","Abby Crowe (75%): I give it a 75% chance that<br />the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates at its<br />September meeting. I base this prediction almost<br />entirely on language presented by Jerome Powell,<br />the Chair of the Fed. Specifically this quote:<br />“The time has come for policy to adjust. The<br />direction of travel is clear, and the timing and<br />pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data,<br />the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,”<br />which he said in late August. He has hinted in the<br />past year at several cuts, and with the last two<br />meetings of the year approaching quickly, I think<br />there is a high likelihood of interest rate cuts<br />at the next meeting. Because I am in no place to<br />speak on markets and the fluctuation of interest<br />rates, I am leaning into expert opinions and<br />direct quotes to guide my forecast.","Hayden Morehouse (95%): I put 95% for this<br />question for mainly one reason, Federal Reserve<br />Chair Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole about<br />a week ago and he strongly hinted that the Fed<br />plans to cut rates. He said “The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel<br />is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts<br />will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks,”. To me<br />this means that a rate cut is coming, they just<br />have not declared how much rates will be cut<br />by. This has been something that has been long<br />overdue in some peoples eyes and I am nearly<br />certain the announcment will come in September.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Haley Ford (95%): I am giving this such a high<br />probability because the word's out of Jerome<br />Powell's mouth himself, and the slew of articles<br />from WSJ, NYT etc. that verify that a rate cut<br />is expected, it is the amount that is a point of<br />speculation at the moment.","Colin Barry (75%): In recent weeks, speculation<br />over whether the FED will cut interest rates has<br />largely shifted from whether or not they will cut<br />them to, how much will they lower them by. This<br />follows Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair,<br />'s recent hint that changes will be coming soon<br />and that the direct of these changes has become<br />clear. This indicates that questions of when the<br />FED will cut rates will be answered, the only<br />question that remains is how soon. Many fixed<br />markets are fully preparing for the FED to cut<br />rates at its September meeting, as experts have<br />predicted following this hint. I expect that this<br />preparation indicates that there is around a 75%<br />chance that rates will be cut on September 18th.","Brooke McDermott (85%): It seems extremely likely<br />that the Fed will cut rates this September. The<br />Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has<br />said publicly that that's what the Fed intend to<br />do coming closer to the meeting. Inflation has<br />fallen significantly from our peak two years ago,<br />and is not far off from the Fed's target at 2.5%.<br />I think the next question is how much will the Fed<br />cut down, which seems to be the common denominator<br />amongst news outlets. Some Wall Street traders<br />are estimating that there is a 1/3 chance that<br />the Fed will cut by at least a half point, others<br />are saying a proposal of .25 over the span of the<br />next three meetings. I felt it may be best to stay<br />conservative in my prediction due to the fact that<br />the August unemployment rate will play a role in<br />how much the Fed cuts rates, in addition to other<br />factors. I think this pay pose a small risk to the<br />rates decreasing. Additionally, there is some risk<br />politically in that it would benefit the Harris<br />campaign greatly for us to see continued growth,<br />and the Trump campaign is extremely resistant to<br />rate cuts so close to the election.","Franco Bravo (75%): After having discussed with<br />several of my friends who are business, finance<br />and overall more in tune with this subject, they<br />are very confident that the Fed will lower rates.<br />One of my friends told me that they discussed this<br />in one of his classes and his professor told them<br />that he was almost positive that this infact will<br />happen.","Alexis Frazer (85%): The chairman of the feds<br />asserted a very strong message in his last remarks<br />that the interest rates will be taken down this<br />quarter. The primary debate surrounding interest<br />rates is less whether or not the reserve will<br />decrease interest rates, but rather by how much<br />they will decrease interest rates. Will it be a<br />quarter or half point reduction? I will be happy<br />with either, and am hoping this politician is<br />being truthful because it has been a decent amount<br />of time since interest rates were lowered and they<br />nearly promised an upcoming change.","Edward L Tsui (84.5%): I am hedging my<br />probability. I based my number on multiple<br />sources. According to CNBC and Fox Business, the<br />term trader used indicates traders think there<br />is a 100% chance of a FED rate cut. Other sources<br />indicate a 93.3% probability, and the 30 day FED<br />Future Rate with the CME group (at 4:50pm) show a<br />reduction in expected price of the future of 0.02%<br />in the future price, which is about a 25 to a 80<br />base point reduction in the overall interest rate.<br />According to the FED Watch as well, there is a<br />67.5% expectation of a target rate in September to<br />be between 500-525 base points (5-5.25% interest<br />rate) and a 37.5% expectation for 475-500 base<br />points. (4.75-5% interest rate) Both expectations<br />are lower than the current rate this week of 5.5%","Carson Ankeny (90%): I strongly believe that<br />the Fed will cut interest rates at the September<br />meeting. This is due to a variety of factors,<br />most importantly statements from the Fed Chairman<br />himself, as well as the pressing economic factors<br />that would cause the Fed to make that decision.<br />While there is a small chance that rates are<br />not lowered, most likely due to a conservative<br />and “safe” fiscal mindset that the Fed has<br />historically possessed under Chairman Powell, I<br />believe that the pressures on the Fed to act are<br />too great, and that there will be at least a small<br />decrease at the meeting on September 18th, leading<br />to incremental cuts at their remaining meetings<br />for the rest of the year.","Gracie Culpepper (75%): I'm putting mine very high<br />because based off of what the chairman said, I<br />really believe that they will lower the interest<br />rates. His last remarks seemed to hint that he was<br />interested in voting for them to go down, and most<br />websites I looked at were debating how much it<br />would drop by, not if it would drop at all.","Victor Avila (80%): I believe the FED will decide<br />to lower its rates at its September meeting with<br />an 80% probability. I came to these findings<br />through researching the history of the Federal<br />Interest Rates and how long they typically peak<br />and fall. Rates most recently peaked in August<br />2023 at 5.33. I then found a point in time with<br />similar rates and similar inflation (2.9). This<br />year was 2006. ⅘ similar scenarios have rates<br />peaking for about a year before the FED drops<br />rates. August 2024 makes a year that rates have<br />been steady at 5.33 as I anticipate them lowering<br />in September.","Corinne O'Dell (80%): Federal Reserve Chair Jerome<br />Powell strongly hinted that a cut is coming, and<br />many other financial analysists think the same.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): Given the current economic<br />conditions and the signals from the Federal<br />Reserve, I'd estimate the probability of the Fed<br />deciding to lower interest rates at its September<br />2024 meeting to be around 75%. This reflects a<br />strong likelihood, but not a certainty, as the Fed<br />remains cautious and data-dependent.","David Daniels (95%): This question has been nearly<br />answered prior to the date of the meeting. Federal<br />Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the<br />fed will likely make changes that lower interest<br />rates as indicated by his words, \"The time has<br />come for policy to adjust. The direction of<br />travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate<br />cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks.” Even without<br />this bombshell of information I would still be<br />in the 80-90 probability because of historical<br />baselines established with trends of inflation and<br />fed meetings.","John Mathis (90%): Well, unemployment has rose<br />to 4.3% when it was at a low of 1% last year,<br />according to McGregor McCance of University of<br />Virginia. Furthermore, according to the same<br />source, the Fed is satisfied with the 2% interest<br />rates it has recently achieved. So, because<br />interest rates are cooling and unemployment is<br />on the rise, it only makes sense for the Fed to<br />cut interest rates. All of this has led head of<br />the Fed Jerome Powell to say “the time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.” This, to me, hints<br />that the Chair of the Fed aims to cut interest<br />rates no matter what, but the size of those cuts<br />will depend on a lot of economic factors. While<br />Powell does not single-handedly decide the rate<br />adjustments, he is the head of the Federal Open<br />Market Committee, so I doubt he would say this<br />without certainty that the rest of the board will<br />back him up. Furthermore, more members of the<br />committee were seemingly open to cutting rates<br />back in July, and since pressure has only mounted<br />since then, I expect more and more members to be<br />on board with cutting rates. Given the historical<br />record of the Fed cutting interest rates with<br />rising unemployment and falling inflation rates<br />(historical record), as well as hearing it<br />straight from the mouth of the Fed Chair himself<br />(expert opinion), I can confidently say there is a<br />90% chance the Fed will cut rates in September.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (65%): After reading<br />articles and becoming slightly more informed on<br />the topic, a lot of experts have weighted in and<br />said that the feds will cut rates down by .25%. My<br />finance friend said that her professor explained<br />that probably won't happen because of the director<br />of the fed reserve, so I was slightly confused.<br />But after revising some of the information again<br />(and trusting my gut feeling which is probably not<br />a good idea) I'm going with 65.","Matthew Harvey (85%): There are a lot of factors<br />that are going into this decision. First and<br />foremost. The fed chair signals “Time Has Come”<br />for the September meeting. They are hinting at<br />cutting the interest rates on September the 18th.<br />The FOMC has also added in the previous July<br />meeting that all participants are supporting a<br />funds rate cut. Every news sources is saying that<br />the fed interest rate cut is highly likely. I<br />have hardly any doubt that this is going to occur.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Vikram Bharadwaj (99%): It is clear to me that<br />with the market predicting with a virtually 100%<br />consensus that rates are going to be cut, that<br />this event is going to occur. Both Powell and<br />many other higher-ups in the Federal Reserve have<br />strongly hinted at rate cuts, and nearly every<br />graphic and estimation shows that now is the time<br />for rate cuts.","William Willis (95%): The fact that we have an<br />unemployment rate that is trending higher than<br />usual, our inflation rate is relatively high,<br />looking at the history shows that we will have a<br />cut. I found all of the unemployment rates from<br />the last 20 years, the inflation rate from the<br />last 20 years, and the fed rates for the last 20<br />years, and then when the rate cuts occurred. I<br />looked at them all side by side and found a trend<br />in the numbers. Each rate cut had a trend of high<br />unemployment rate and low inflation rate. I also<br />looked up information and found the Jerome Powell<br />stated that the “time has come to cut rates”, to<br />CNBC. There for which great certainty with what<br />the numbers are telling me I gave it a probability<br />of 95%.","Minha Ahmad (75%): I would say that the<br />probability is 75% due to several expert opinions.<br />Forbes, Reuters, and Fortune are just some among<br />many networks that have reported predictions that<br />there will be cuts.","Leo Zegarra (85%): The federal reserve chair,<br />Jerome Powell, has already given a speech on<br />what will occur. He made it clear that \"the<br />central bank was poised to cut interest rates in<br />September\" (New York Times). That was on August<br />23rd. However, he did claim on July 31st that \"the<br />market needs to stay [the way that it is].\" For<br />that reason, there is some doubt. Realistically,<br />however, with it being closer to the 09/17 and<br />09/18 meeting date and with Powell not only<br />saying there will be a cut but also discussing<br />specifically how much of a cut there will be, I am<br />leaning more towards yes.","Reece Slater (88%): I looked at personal<br />interviews and speeches given by Jerome Powell<br />which indicate almost certainty that the fed will<br />cut rates. I also looked at data by traders which<br />indicate close to a 100% chance that the fed<br />will cut rates by September. All sources that I<br />investigated are almost certain that the fed will<br />cut rates, the question is just a matter of how<br />much and what the impacts will be.","Alex Vrolijk (80%): Inflation has continued to<br />drop closer to the target 2% goal as the federal<br />interest rates remain high at over 5%. The fed<br />was already considering lowering interest rates<br />at their July meeting but decided not to. It has<br />been stated that a vast majority of Fed officials<br />believe a cut is likely in the upcoming meeting.","Findleigh Ague (79%): Interest rates have been<br />raised 11 times since March 2022 to counteract<br />inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee<br />meets several times throughout the year to discuss<br />different topics such as interest rates, but so<br />far, they have declined to lower them. Although<br />this is true, inflation is currently at the lowest<br />rate (2.9%) that it has been since March 2021.<br />Additionally, the Consumer Price Index has fallen<br />to 3%, which is reflective of lower inflation<br />rates, as on average, consumers are paying less.<br />When the CPI fell, the Fed projected that interest<br />rates would be cut to 5.1% by the end of the year.<br />Also, the CME FedWatch tracker predicts that at<br />the FOMC's September 17th and 18th meeting, there<br />is a 69.5% chance that interest rates will be cut<br />to 5-5.25%. For these reasons, I think that it is<br />pretty likely that interest rates will be cut at<br />their meeting in the next few weeks.","Simon Gersten (10%): If inflation is persistently<br />above the Fed’s 2% target, the Fed is unlikely to<br />lower rates. Inflation has been persistently above<br />the 2% target and appears to be continuing to do<br />so.","Oladipupo Fashogbon (80%): Inflation is all time<br />high so people do not want ot buy things. If they<br />lower the interest rates people would want to buy."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.38],"y":[3.0008383897133171],"text":"Crowd (38%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(TRUE,0)","legendgroup":"(TRUE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.46999999999999997,0.81000000000000005],"y":[0.95805080782156438,2.0395286704879254],"text":["Crowd (47%)","Crowd (81%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(TRUE,1)","legendgroup":"(TRUE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will a Category IV (or<br />above) hurricane hit the<br />mainland US before Dec 1?","Will the US Federal<br />Reserve decide to lower<br />interest rates at its<br />September meeting?","Will UGA football be<br />undefeated in its regular<br />season?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will a Category IV (or<br />above) hurricane hit the<br />mainland US before Dec 1?","Will the US Federal<br />Reserve decide to lower<br />interest rates at its<br />September meeting?","Will UGA football be<br />undefeated in its regular<br />season?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"35d841a5384c":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"35d860e361e8":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"35d841a5384c","visdat":{"35d841a5384c":["function (y) ","x"],"35d860e361e8":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

It must also never join<br />NATO or develop nuclear weapons for a ceasefire<br />to be agreed to as well. These were extremely<br />unreasonable demands at the time, as Ukraine would<br />never agree to those requirements. As the year<br />progressed, Ukraine made advancements in Russia<br />in an attempt to push them towards a ceasefire.<br />Despite that, I don't see either country giving up<br />unless one side takes extremely heavy losses.","Erin Ho (35%): Honestly, this is a number I came<br />to after reading some of the reports and being<br />pessimistic. With Putin’s terms for a complete<br />ceasefire, it does not look very promising<br />considering it is asking for the complete<br />surrender of Ukrainian regions and Ukraine to<br />give up entering NATO. President Zelensky compared<br />it to Hitler’s actions in Czechoslovakia, and<br />it doesn’t look like Putin will accept any other<br />conditions. I wanted to make the percentage lower,<br />but I think this is a good number.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires only happen when<br />both sides believe they have more to gain from<br />peace than continued fighting. At the moment,<br />we're very far from that. Putin believes he can<br />wait out the resolve of Ukraine and its Western<br />supporters, and is unwilling to end the war<br />without guarantees that NATO will not expand into<br />Ukraine. And solid majorities of the Ukrainian<br />public express unwillingness to negotiate a<br />ceasefire that surrenders any land to Russia.<br />With nearly 1/5 of the country occupied and no<br />clear signs that that will change anytime soon,<br />Zelenskyy is facing no significant pressure to<br />pursue a ceasefire either. In the coming years,<br />both countries will find recruiting and retaining<br />military personnel more and more difficult, and<br />will eventually seek peace, but there is very<br />little chance of that in the next three months.","Minha Ahmad (40%): This summer, Putin made several<br />comments regarding a ceasefire, however, he was<br />also demanding that Ukraine handed over certain<br />regions. It seems that Russia will be more adamant<br />in regards to their demands, and I do not see a<br />ceasefire agreement occurring by December 1st.","Abby Crowe (5%): I only give a 5% chance that<br />Russia and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire<br />before December 1st. I am basing this prediction<br />on both the unwillingness to compromise from<br />Russia and the resolve that Ukraine has shown<br />since the war broke out. Additionally, Russia is<br />a veto member of the UN Security Council, and will<br />strike down any proposed ceasefire resolutions<br />that do not benefit Russia. They are pitted<br />against the rest of the permanent 5 member on the<br />council who are supporting Ukraine, and therefore<br />one of the most common pathways to ceasefire in<br />history is at a complete standstill. Additionally,<br />Ukraine has launched a counter-offensive, proving<br />their will and ability to stay at war for the<br />time being. Considering all these factors,<br />the probability of a ceasefire anytime soon is<br />extremely low.","Simon Gersten (10%): Explanation in brief.<br />Basically, Russia making gains, Ukraine backed by<br />countries that will not let it fall. Don't fight<br />the Russians in winter.","Hayden Morehouse (26%): This is a conflict that<br />has been going on since 2022 now. After some<br />research it seems that Putin would like to reach<br />a ceasefire instead of just a pause with Ukraine.<br />However, he challenges the legitimacy of Ukraine<br />as a state. This war is very expensive and violent<br />for both sides. However these things can drag on<br />without reaching a formal ceasefire that’s why I<br />am keeping my prediction low.","Jessica armour (33%): Based on recent news<br />articles of speakers for Ukraine stating that<br />they plan on indefinitely holding the territory in<br />Russia, I would say it is very unlikely that this<br />territory is given up before December 1, which is<br />the only condition Putin had for ceasefire. Also<br />based on the amount of time that has passed since<br />this conflict has started and the limited amount<br />of success either has had on ceasefire I would<br />say this event yields a 33 in probability for it<br />occurring, as more than likely it will not.","Liv Payne (15%): After extended research on the<br />topic, it seems highly unlikely that Russia or<br />Ukraine would agree to a ceasefire. Putin has<br />made \"an attempt\" at negotations, but Zelensky<br />will accept nothing less than complete withdrawal.<br />However, as the US election nears, we will know<br />more. The removal of US troops (which is likely<br />to occur if Trump wins) seems to guarantee a<br />Ukrainian defeat, whereas if Ukraine is permitted<br />into NATO, Russia would be quickly overwhelmed by<br />other forces. In either case, it seems unlikely<br />for things to change before December 1st, as many<br />predict the war continuing into early 2025.","Gracie Culpepper (17%): Ultimately, the<br />probability number that I am deciding to lock<br />in for this question is 17%. This is a very low<br />number, but my first reason for this is that both<br />leaders of these countries are very determined<br />to get the results they want. Neither of these<br />people want to lose the trust of their citizens,<br />and I think that is playing a big role in the<br />continuation of this war. Another reason is that<br />just this past May people thought a ceasefire<br />would occur and it never did. Both of these<br />countries have such a deep history with each other<br />and have a severe amount of nationalistic pride,<br />that I just don’t see a ceasefire occurring before<br />December 1st being that probable.","Vikram Bharadwaj (35%): At the center of this war<br />is the Donbas region of Ukraine. With the Russian<br />proposed ceasefire from June 15th was completely<br />rejected by Kyiv due to how obscene it is when<br />it regards the Donbas region and Crimea. And with<br />the recent drone strike, I doubt that a ceasefire<br />is on the minds of Ukrainians right now. However<br />given the possibility of the US pulling support<br />for Ukraine, there is still a significantly<br />possible chance that there would be a ceasefire<br />agreement.","Alexis Frazer (10%): The conflict between Russia<br />and Ukraine has been ongoing since early 2014. In<br />a speech on 14 June 2024, Putin outlined Russia's<br />terms for a ceasefire. He said that Russia would<br />not negotiate unless Ukraine handed over the<br />provinces of Ukraine claimed by Russia, including<br />the parts Russia does not control. It seems<br />extremely unlikely for Ukraine to back down now<br />especially with the assistance from the US.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): I think that there is a<br />25% likelihood that Russia and Ukraine will agree<br />to a ceasefire before Dec 1 because unexpected<br />diplomatic breakthroughs or changes in military<br />dynamics could occur, but there are significant<br />challenges that make a ceasefire unlikely in the<br />immediate future.","Corinne O'Dell (25%): I think the polarization<br />between the two countries is too strong and there<br />is too much deep history for a ceasefire in the<br />next coming months.","Haley Ford (10%): It does not seem likely that<br />this would occur-Russia gave Ukraine an ultimatum<br />that Ukraine viewed as “Hitler-like” per Zelensky,<br />who in turn will not negotiate until Russian<br />forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including<br />Crimea. Thus, after approaching about day 1000 of<br />war, a ceasefire agreement seems unlikely still.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (25%): At first, whenever<br />you look up \"will Russia and Ukraine agree<br />to a ceasefire,\" Microsoft Bing says yes. But<br />when you look at the article being cited, it is<br />from 2021. This sort of resonates with what the<br />reading for this week said. After reading some<br />sources, a ceasefire would be a smart move for<br />Russia, as public support for the war in Russia<br />has decreased significantly, and Putin tends to<br />care about support ratings. However, in order<br />for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, they request<br />Ukraine to withdraw from the 4 regions Russia<br />claims and to drop aspirations to join NATO. These<br />are requests that Ukraine will probably not agree<br />on. Recently, Ukraine launched an incursion which<br />was (obviously) not received well by Russia. But,<br />Ukraine is using this as an opportunity to force<br />Russia to come back into a peace talk. If the<br />West gets too involved, by sending military aid or<br />weapons of any kind, or attempts to join the peace<br />talks discussions, Russia will not agree. TLDR:<br />At the end of the day, I think that a ceasefire<br />before December 1 is unlikely.","Brooke McDermott (24%): I was looking at the<br />current status of the news on Ukraine and Russia,<br />and Russia most recently has seemed resistant to<br />peace talks due to wanting to maintain control<br />of intercepted Ukrainian lands. Additionally,<br />just today Russia bombed Ukraine and killed 51<br />individuals and wounded over 100. Just recently,<br />Putin just announced that Russia's nuclear<br />weapons policy is bound to change, insinuating<br />that Russian forces do not plan on submitting<br />anytime soon. Historically, some Ukrainian news<br />sources and analysts predicted, based on studies<br />of military conflicts over the last two centuries,<br />that the war would be roughly 7-8 months.","John Mathis (15%): I think that Russia and Ukraine<br />have shown no signs of being open to making a<br />peace deal and I doubt that will change anytime<br />soon, since according to Al-jazeera, Ukraine<br />demands that all previously seized territories<br />including the lands from the 2014 Crimea<br />invasion. Furthermore, Russia has started to make<br />more grounds in Ukraine after the end of their<br />counterattack, and unless Putin is completely<br />ousted from power, which seems unlikely given<br />his ties with China and control of the oligarchs.<br />Overall, given the small chance that putin is<br />ousted and the war ends, I give it about a 15%<br />chance.","Colin Barry (15%): I think the chances of a<br />ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine are low at<br />around a 15% chance. This is because of Putin's<br />statements this year that he would only agree to<br />a ceasefire that respects the current land changes<br />after the last couple years of conflict. I don't<br />think this is a deal that a U.S. backed Ukraine<br />would be willing to accept, and would instead seek<br />out a return of all the land lost in the conflict.","William Willis (42%): I came up with this number<br />because I talked to a marine this summer who had<br />a friend who lived in Ukraine and he said that he<br />doesn't see the war stopping anytime soon. He said<br />that the Ukraine economy is propped up on the War.<br />As long as the US keeps sending supplies the war<br />will continue.","David Daniels (35%): This question, in particular,<br />has been challenging for me. I've consulted with<br />several self-proclaimed 'international conflict<br />experts,' and they all seem to agree on one thing:<br />nothing significant will happen until the USA<br />takes decisive action. From what I've read and<br />heard, Putin will likely test his limits until<br />this election season concludes and the political<br />landscape becomes clearer. Given that the current<br />political leadership appears weak, I doubt any<br />steps will be taken toward a ceasefire. My main<br />concern, however, is the territory Ukraine has<br />seized in Russia. Although this occupation is<br />relatively small compared to Russia's hold on<br />Ukrainian land, it might still exert pressure on<br />Putin from his oligarchs. This is why I estimate<br />the probability at 35%.","Leo Zegarra (10%): I gave a really low probability<br />due to both sides having strong, conflicting<br />goals and continuing to engage heavily in the<br />conflict without finding any real middle ground<br />whatsoever. Russia is determined to maintain<br />control over certain territories and keep its<br />influence in Ukraine, while Ukraine insists on<br />a full withdrawal of Russian troops and will<br />not leave the territories that Putin wants them<br />to exit. Even though there is pressure from the<br />international community to end the fighting, and<br />both sides are feeling the strain of war, they<br />each believe they still have something to gain by<br />continuing. Without a clear military a big change<br />in strategy, a ceasefire is not likely anytime<br />soon, especially within 2 months.","Findleigh Ague (23%): Based on what I've read<br />on the current state of relations between Russia<br />and Ukraine, it does not seem that Putin nor<br />Zelenskyy are ready to meet each other's terms to<br />come to a ceasefire. Putin's demands would require<br />Ukraine to give up too much of their sovereignty,<br />which is an ultimatum that they are not willing<br />to fulfill. Right before the 2024 Ukraine Peace<br />Summit was held, Putin released a statement saying<br />that Russia would ceasefire once Ukrainian troops<br />are removed from the four territories that they<br />perviously annexed and abandon all plans to join<br />NATO. Zelenskyy obviously is not willing to do<br />something as this, as he compared these words and<br />actions to those of Hitler. For these reasons, I<br />don't see that it is very likely that both Russia<br />and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire before<br />December 1st.","Abigail Harris (10%): Russia is demanding<br />significant land claim acknowledgment from<br />Ukraine. Ukraine wants full recognition of its<br />borders. The larger international community<br />doesn't want to anger Russia as far as the P5 is<br />concerned. The UN is useless because Russia has<br />veto power. I believe we've reached a familiar<br />precedent as far as Russia and other former Soviet<br />states are concerned. America and France are happy<br />to continue monetarily supporting Ukraine against<br />their former foe, but the reality is that Ukraine<br />is not in a position to be making demands, and<br />Russia has to think about the larger optics and<br />the desire for actually usable land and people<br />to labor on it. I would rather have money if I<br />pulled a single red ball out of a hat with nine<br />green balls than if Russia and Ukraine reached<br />a ceasefire. The ten percent is really only<br />there if the US somehow camp davids the two in<br />a never before seen stroke of post 2020 American<br />government competency.","Reece Slater (18%): I compiled speeches and<br />interviews from both Putin and Zelensky as well<br />as opinions from experts regarding the conflict.<br />I think this conflict will last well into 2025.<br />It is important to consider the motives of these<br />two leaders, especially Putin who is leading<br />the offensive. I don't think they will have an<br />incentive to negotiate a ceasefire until their<br />army cannot produce the arms at a quick enough<br />rate to continue. This is beginning to happen, but<br />I do not think it will happen before Dec 1.","Victor Avila (5%): Russia recently struck a<br />Ukrainian hospital and military academy killing<br />50 and wounding over 200. Zelensky also stated<br />that Ukraine will be holding onto the Kursk region<br />in Russia for the time being. That being said, I<br />think its best to bet against a ceasefire before<br />the date, considering the lack of progress thats<br />been made.","Matthew Harvey (25%): I believe that a great<br />deal leading into my percentage arrived from<br />events that occurred on September 3rd. Russia<br />shot 2 ballistic missiles into Ukraine and had<br />a confirm kill rate of 46 people. These weren't<br />military officers but rather civilians. I believe<br />that chances of a cease-fire went up in smoke<br />after such a strike. There might have been higher<br />chances before, however this attack is all but<br />going to stir up more conflict. This is also<br />based upon Ukraine not wanting to give up Russian<br />territory they have claimed. Both sides are not<br />willing to do things that would lead to eventual<br />peace talks.","Rommy Etzion (22%): All partial-ceasefire<br />negotiations in the past have either failed<br />largely (humanitarian corridor) or momentarily<br />worked and quickly fell. Russian previous<br />conditions involved maximalist demands with little<br />concession. The most recent negotiation regarding<br />energy facilities was derailed due to a surprise<br />inclusion by Ukraine, and because of that Russia<br />has vowed not to soften his position. Neither<br />state trusts each other, both have refused to<br />concede, and have yet to successfully discuss a<br />partial-ceasefire to specific sectors of the war.<br />A full ceasefire is even less likely. That being<br />said, military analysts have expressed skepticism<br />that Ukrainians forces can maintain control over<br />Russian territory, and concern on whether they<br />can survive this winter in Russian bombardment on<br />energy continued. This will raise the likelihood<br />of a ceasefire.","Sara Whitmire (5%): I don’t see a ceasefire<br />happening anytime soon. This conflict is seen<br />as one of the most devastating wars in Europe<br />since WWII, based on a deep, historical conflict<br />that can’t be solved within a few months.<br />Moreover, this war is ultimately decided by<br />Putin and Zelensky, two world leaders with crazy<br />personalities and citizens to represent. if Putin<br />ends the war, he looks weak, and if Zelensky ends<br />the war, the fight for Ukraine dies entirely. To<br />be frank, this war won’t end until one of them<br />dies. I didn't estimate 0% because there is a<br />potential for condemnation from the UN or some<br />other miracle. The fight to take back Ukraine<br />is an effort to re-assert Russia as a global<br />superpower on the world stage, and with the US<br />election, chances for a ceasefire on Putin's part<br />are low.","Jeffrey Markowitz (10%): Fighting has continued<br />and showed no signs of stopping. Putin has shown<br />that he will not cooperate with a ceasefire unless<br />Ukraine gives up incredible amounts of land.<br />Ceasefires have been in talks, but little progress<br />has been made.","Kira Liscombe (10%): In June of this year, Putin<br />spoke on a ceasefire and called on the Ukrainian<br />government to withdraw from four regions partially<br />occupied by Russia - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson,<br />and Zaporizhzhia. He also said Ukraine would need<br />to officially give up in its efforts to join the<br />NATO military alliance for the Russian advance<br />to be halted. Despite these former negotiations,<br />Ukraine seems unwilling to comply with Russia's<br />ultimatum. I found an expert opinion from Ruth<br />Deyermond, senior lecturer in the Department<br />of War Studies at King's College London RFE/RL<br />claiming, \"It's always dangerous to make<br />predictions, but it's difficult to imagine the war<br />ending by the end of 2024\". Based on all of this<br />information, and the lack of any recent news on<br />cease-fire negotiations between the countries, I<br />predicted a very low probability that we will see<br />any ceasefire before December.","Carson Ankeny (20%): I do not think there is a<br />very high chance for a ceasefire. While there have<br />been attempts to negotiate one, they have been<br />unsuccessful so far. Even as the international<br />community tries to place pressure on Russia,<br />neither side wants to come to the table, because<br />neither side is willing to make concessions.","Alex Vrolijk (20%): This is because Putin has said<br />that he will only agree to a ceasefire if Ukraine<br />hands over four regions and stops any aspirations<br />to join NATO. I see this as highly unlikely and<br />since the war has been ongoing for so long it is<br />hard to believe there will be a ceasefire soon<br />with the attitudes of the country's leaders.","Franco Bravo (50%): I went for 50% just because<br />from what I know in this topic, Putin is an<br />incredibly radical and unpredictable man.<br />Furthermore, Ukraine has been making several<br />military advances into mainland Russia which would<br />make it much more likely for there to be peace<br />talks. In my opinion there will be Peace talks in<br />the near future but I am unsure whether one will<br />happen by December First","Oladipupo Fashogbon (30%): To me, both sides<br />have shown little sign of willingness to agree<br />to a comprehensive ceasefire.

Although I<br />have not watched any of the shows, practically<br />all the rankings for each series shows 3 Body<br />Problem being ranked last. So, given that they're<br />predicted to be last of 8, it shows that the<br />ranking sites are putting a massive 7 shows above<br />this series. It seems virtually impossible for<br />the show to actually win. Plus, they have a +1600<br />betting odds to win, the highest out of all the<br />shows. I will give my first 0% probability that<br />this will happen.","Hayden Morehouse (5%): I don't know anything about<br />this show or much about the emmys so I went with<br />ole reliable and looked up the vegas betting odds.<br />They had this show at the lowest probability so<br />I am going to take a gamble and say this is not<br />going to happen.","Abby Crowe (10%): I predict a 10% chance that the<br />show “3 Body Problem” will win the Emmy. They are<br />competing against 7 other shows, several of which<br />have far more nominations and publicity. If the<br />question were broader about the show winning any<br />Emmy this year, I would be more generous, but with<br />the specificity of the question, I find it highly<br />unlikely.","Minha Ahmad (60%): I think it is highly likely<br />that the show will win the Emmy due to its past<br />success. It was the most-watched show on Netflix<br />at the end of March. The show has also been<br />nominated for six emmys this season.","Ryan Foley (10%): A sci-fi show has never won<br />the Emmy for this category and there is too much<br />competition that beats 3 Body Problem this year.<br />Fallout and Shogun both have higher ratings and<br />are true to their source material. 3 Body Problem<br />on the other hand whitewashes its characters<br />and falls short of providing an accurate<br />representation of the story it draws from.","William Willis (8%): I read on Vanity fair that<br />the show Shōgun performed at the Creative Arts<br />Emmys and that you would be a fool not to predict<br />a win here. Apparently Shogun is dominating in<br />every category. I don't have any faith in 3 Body<br />problem and the reviews I saw online did not give<br />them the best rating.","Corinne O'Dell (10%): If you look at just the<br />numbers, there are 8 other shows nominated, which<br />puts it at a mathematical 12.5%. However, the<br />show has received many positive reviews. After<br />researching the category and looking at what the<br />experts are saying, the show Shōgun is the front<br />runner for the award, as it has been sweeping<br />everything else. That is why I have lowered my<br />prediction to 10%.","Edward Tsui (2.94%): The Vegas Insider betting<br />odds have \"3 Body Problem\" at +3300, which means<br />if I were to put a $100 bet on the show winning, I<br />would make my 100 back along with 3300. This high<br />payout, especially being a positive bet, means<br />the outcome is very unlikely. Using an implied<br />probability calculator, with ODDS/ (ODDS +100)<br />that equals 0.0294 or 2.94%. Using reviews online,<br />Shogun has the highest nominations and likelihood<br />to make it the winner. Furthermore, 3 Body Problem<br />is tied for dead last in ranking with The Gilded<br />Age out of list of 8 nominations for the Emmys.","Haley Ford (2%): Based on online discourse and<br />Gold Derby odds, Shogun is favored immensely.<br />Additionally, the odds in Gold Derby are<br />the lowest out of all the choices, and it is<br />more difficult for a new series to win this<br />award--although Shogun is new it seems to garner<br />much more support and was also nominated for many<br />categories across the board.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): Other shows have much<br />higher rotten tomatoes scores.","Brooke McDermott (10%): There are a lot of factors<br />pushing against their win. Primarily, there is<br />a much higher change that their competitor in<br />the category, Shogun, wins. It showed a lot of<br />success at the Creative Arts Emmys show, which<br />makes it kind of a shoe in to win on the 15th.<br />Additionally, the last few years, the Outstanding<br />Drama Series have typically gone to shows that<br />show interfamilial turmoil or issues within social<br />spheres, like Succession and Game of Thrones. I<br />think those who made the show have a really good<br />track record in writing and cinematography (in<br />terms of previous Emmy award and noms in said<br />categories) , but that was from their stints on<br />Game of Thrones.","Jessica armour (30%): The show currently has six<br />different nominations for an Emmy, however there<br />are several other shows which currently have 19+<br />Emmy nominations.Therefore, I think it is unlikely<br />that the show \"Three Body Problem\" will receive an<br />Emmy when it has a significantly lower portion of<br />nominations compared to other shows streaming on<br />Netflix.","Simon Gersten (10%): Shogun is the frontrunner and<br />has been nominated for 25 Emmys, making it highly<br />unlikely that 3 body problem will surpass it.","Vikram Bharadwaj (5%): When it comes to the<br />Emmy awards, especially for Dramas, there is a<br />clear trend with the committee heavily avoiding<br />Sci-Fi shows in general. With 3 body problem not<br />being the most especially well received shows<br />as compared to shows such as 将軍(Shōgun) which<br />is by and far the most likely to win the award.<br />Especially when we start to consider just how many<br />strong shows there are this year, 3 body problem<br />is such a huge outlier in how poorly received<br />it was by a large part of its fandom. Truly 3<br />body problem winning this award would be an act<br />of god wanting my brier score to get absolutely<br />destroyed.","Kira Liscombe (5%): I made the forecast that on<br />a scale of 0 to 100, there is a probability of 5<br />that the show \"3 Body Problem\" will win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding Drama Series on Sep 15. To<br />determine this, I compared \"3 Body Problem\" to its<br />top competitor, analyzing media predictions, other<br />awards/accreditations received by the series, and<br />the previous Outstanding Drama Series winner. I<br />explained this further in depth in my brief.","Liv Payne (20%): \"3 Body Problem\" has stiff<br />competition this year at the Emmy's. For one, \"The<br />Crown\" is up for the same award, and that series<br />has already received 21 Emmy's since 2016. Then<br />there is \"Shōgun\", which has broken the record for<br />the most wins in a single season at 14 wins. Up<br />against these two alone, it seems unlikely that<br />\"3 Body Problem\" will win, so I put my probability<br />around 20%.","Reece Slater (4%): I haven't seen any of these<br />shows personally, but everyone online seems to<br />be talking about Shogun and The Crown as the<br />front-runners, and noting \"3 Body Problem\" as a<br />very random nomination. Also, Mr. and Mrs. Smith<br />is largely talked about from some sources. I have<br />yet to see a prediction that even mentions \"3 Body<br />Problem\" to win, so I'm going to gamble and say 4%<br />chance.","Erin Ho (15%): Full disclosure, I have not<br />watched any of the shows that have been listed<br />for this Emmy Award and I’ve only “loosely”<br />heard about some of them from people I know.<br />Looking at previous years Emmy Award winners<br />for this category, many of them had more than<br />20 nominations in other categories and some won<br />multiple Emmys on top of the Outstanding Drama<br />Series. While “3 Body Problem” might have 6 Emmy<br />nominations overall, it’s facing off against<br />other series in this category that have 18 or<br />more nominations such as “Shogun” and “The Morning<br />Show.”","Shayna Van Glish (30%): I think that is is<br />unlikely that 3 Body Problem will win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding Drama Series, as Shogun is<br />leading most predictions. However, it definitely<br />is a contender so there still is a chance it could<br />happen.","Alexis Frazer (25%): While there is a chance that<br />3 Body Problem will win the Emmy, its contenders<br />are more critically acclaimed and recieved more<br />nominations, which is a solid indicator that they<br />will receive more Emmys.","Colin Barry (0.5%): I think that \"3 Body Problem\"<br />has an incredibly low chance to win the award for<br />Most Outstanding Drama at around a 0.5% chance<br />to win. This is because the show is nominated<br />for very few awards, a characteristic that many<br />shows that due end up winning the award share. As<br />well as being nominated in the same wave as FX's<br />\"Shogun\", which is on pace to sweep the Emmys in a<br />fashion never before seen for a single season of a<br />tv show.","Oladipupo Fashogbon (40%): There are other shows<br />like shotgun that have a higher chance of winning.<br />That show has a higher rotten tomatoes and<br />\"popcorn\" rating.","Gracie Culpepper (27%): I think most likely this<br />won't happen. Usually the bigger awards like<br />these will go to really popular shows, so I would<br />be surprised if this show won for this category.<br />Also, most of the time the winners for the big<br />nominations are also nominated/win other big<br />categories, and I think the likelihood of this<br />show doing that is slim. I think it could happen,<br />just is pretty unlikely.","David Daniels (12%): I would like to preface<br />this forecast by stating that I don't watch<br />the Emmys and have no particular interest in<br />them. My response is based on insights from Emmy<br />enthusiasts and viewer reactions. According to<br />Diesel Labs, \"The Three-Body Problem\" has roughly<br />a 23% chance of occurring, while opinions seem to<br />be more skeptical regarding this show. Vegas has<br />odds for \"3 Body Problem\" at +1600, which roughly<br />equates to a 5.9% chance of happening. Although<br />I am unfamiliar with the show or the Emmys, most<br />predictions suggest that \"Shōgun\" is likely to win<br />this nomination. Given these factors, I estimate<br />the probability of \"The Three-Body Problem\"<br />winning to be around 12%.","Matthew Harvey (20%): The show 3 Body Problem,<br />is a Science Fiction drama show that has been<br />nominated 6 times for this weekend's Emmy<br />Awards. It is an incredible feat for any show<br />to be considered for an Emmy, let alone 6. While<br />this would drastically raise a show's chances<br />of being selected to win the award, Each of the<br />nominations the show has gotten, are also in<br />categories with more well known shows that have<br />grown in popularity with other creations such as<br />Shogun, a top consideration for winning most/if<br />not in all the same categories as the Three-body<br />problem. While predicting winners is the backbone<br />of this class, there are news networks that hire<br />individuals with greater experience than I do<br />currenlty to pick winners of Awards shows such as<br />the Emmy's. In each of the categories the 3 Body<br />Problem is in, in none of them do the predictors<br />have it winning against its competitors. However<br />stranger and unpredictability are two things<br />to consider in any competition. That is why I<br />have a higher percentage than 13% which is what<br />you get for each event nominee winning an emmy<br />in a specific category. It should also be noted<br />that emmy's are an awards show that does not<br />care that each and every show gets an award. If<br />a show should meet the criteria to win in all<br />categories, that is the show they will choose.<br />https://variety.com/lists/2024-emmys-predictions/drama-series-2/","Victor Avila (15%): The Emmy's are in 2 days<br />and the outstanding drama award is packed with<br />great contenders. I did not hear of \"3 body<br />problem\" until reading this question, and while<br />the category has great shows like Shogun and the<br />Crown. The main reason I said it only has a 15%<br />probability to win, it because I read that Sci-Fi<br />movies are much less likely to win this category<br />and its only in its first season.","Franco Bravo (15%): One of the main reasons I<br />gave this such a low probability of happening is<br />mainly because of the competition that it has in<br />the Drama series. With shows like Shogun which<br />has been receiving massive amounts of press and<br />positive spotlight","Alex Vrolijk (30%): A lot of the articles I have<br />been reading online expect Shogun to win the award<br />for Outstanding Drama. I know very little about<br />the Emmy's or these TV shows so I chose 30. It has<br />also happened before that the winner of one of the<br />awards was unexpected, so I do not want to put too<br />confident of a probability.","Findleigh Ague (10%): Basically every source that<br />I have looked at says that Shogun is going to<br />win, and a few saw that The Crown will. I tried<br />to look mostly at media magazines and publications<br />like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, and both<br />favor Shogun. It is also important to look at past<br />winners, but in more recent years, the winners<br />have been shows like The Crown and Succession,<br />which are pretty different from 3 Body Problem.<br />It is true that shows more similar to the sci-fi<br />genre like Game of Thrones have won this award<br />many times, but based on recent trends and<br />experts' opinions on the subject, I don't think<br />that it will win.","Abigail Harris (20%): Every winner of the<br />outstanding drama series Emmy has been a serial<br />runner since 2011. This doesn’t bode well for<br />the 3 body problem which comparatively has just<br />1 season out. There’s also the matter of their<br />six nominations compared to the overwhelming mass<br />from competitors like shogun, which is typically<br />a positive indicator. Also, most of their<br />nominations are for sound mixing or cinematic<br />design while shogun is being lauded for acting<br />and personnel, not a great sign for the three body<br />problem to win in an overall category.","Joe Ornstein (0%): The winner of the Outstanding<br />Drama Series category is typically, though not<br />always, the show with the most total nominations.<br />This year, that would be Shogun, with 25 total<br />Emmy nominations. And it has NEVER (at least in<br />the past 25 years that I checked) been the show<br />with the FEWEST total nominations (3 Body Problem<br />has six). Of all questions we've looked at so<br />far, this is the first one I'm willing to say is<br />practically impossible.","Carson Ankeny (0%): Shogun is basically Game<br />of Thrones 2.0 - a darling of this category at<br />Emmys in previous years.

TIKTOK is under scrutiny with<br />congress but BYTEDANCE shows no clear signs of<br />selling, leaving me unsure about the selling<br />process. Hostorically no other company has sold or<br />been discussed in congress in the same light.","Ryan Foley (15%): When ByteDance was originally in<br />hot water with the US government they were adamant<br />on not selling. I feel like this feeling will<br />remain as they understand how valuable of an asset<br />TikTok is for the company. The algorithm behind<br />the app is crucial to its function and ByteDance<br />is set on keeping that first and foremost. The<br />company has also stated that they would rather<br />a shutdown in the US rather than selling. A<br />major complication as well is the outcome of the<br />November election as Trump has come out and said<br />that he will allow TikTok to continue being used<br />in the US. This makes it even less likely that the<br />company even has to sell in the first place.","Liv Payne (10%): All articles that I found were<br />from June 2024 or earlier, around the time when<br />the US government was making the decision to ban<br />TikTok. ByteDance was given the \"sell or ban\"<br />option, but have said that they will fight the<br />\"unconstitutional law\" in court. Also, if the ban<br />did go into effect, it would not be until 2025, as<br />they were given nine months from the decision to<br />sell. Therefore, I believe it highly unlikely that<br />they will sell.","Erin Ho (10%): Whenever the TikTok ban was first<br />passed in April of this year, ByteDance had<br />announced they had no intentions of selling their<br />platform to any US companies. Instead, they sued<br />the US government over the potential ban and will<br />challenge them over how constitutional this is.<br />I do not think ByteDance will sell, whether they<br />win, lose, or the case gets tossed out, because<br />TikTok is used everywhere else in the world and<br />is well-established as a social media platform.<br />I also believe that there is a benefit to having<br />a social media platform that is not controlled by<br />any US tech company.","Jessica armour (10%): ByteDance released a<br />statement earlier in the year that they have no<br />intentions of selling the platform TikTok, along<br />with this, since the \"sell or ban\" measure was<br />created there seems to be even more push back<br />when it comes to whether or not they will sell.<br />Along with this, taking into consideration the<br />vast amount of times the selling of TikTok has<br />been brought up and has never went through I would<br />say it is highly unlikely that ByteDance will<br />sell. TikTok generates too much money and is too<br />influential for the stakeholder to sell.","Abby Crowe (10%): I predict a 10% chance that<br />ByteDance will announce a deal before December<br />1st. I give a low chance because the company has<br />said directly that they have no plans to sell,<br />and are willing to challenge the US legislation in<br />the court system. Because of the timeline of our<br />courts, and their direct rejection of the idea of<br />selling, I find it highly unlikely that this event<br />will occur in the given timeline.","Haley Ford (20%): This forecasting challenge is<br />more difficult to interpret, however I think the<br />short timeframe makes it slightly easier. Court<br />proceedings could prolong any sale of TikTok and<br />thus I believe it has a low chance of being sold<br />before the December 1st deadline. Additionally,<br />the bill itself gave TikTok till January, which<br />I believe Bytedance would wait to the very end<br />if they were to sell. Thus, I believe there is a<br />20% likelihood of Bytedance selling TikTok before<br />December 1st.","Simon Gersten (10%): Given that Bytedance has<br />said they will not sell the app as the algorithm<br />is central to their business model, it is highly<br />unlikely they will sell the app by Dec. 1. It is<br />far more likely that they will continue to exhaust<br />all legal avenues which could take several years<br />in the courts.","Corinne O'Dell (20%): Given all of the factors<br />surrounding a sale of TikTok, the likelihood of<br />a sale by December 1, 2024 seems highly unlikely.<br />This is because of ByteDance’s continued legal<br />fights, the magnitude of the sale, and the<br />Chinese’s government's stake in the app. TikTok<br />is worth a valued 100 billion, so ByteDance has no<br />incentive to sell the app, as they could continue<br />making money even if the app shutdown in the US.<br />The situation remains dynamic, so there is still a<br />chance that the sale could happen within the next<br />few months. The timeframe is also too short for<br />them to be able to get through a legal battle by<br />Dec 1.","Reece Slater (16%): According to a statement<br />released by ByteDance earlier this year, they have<br />stated that they would rather have TikTok shutdown<br />in the United States than sell it. I also think<br />they are heavily relying on the courts to shut<br />this law down. TikTok is also a very hard entity<br />to dollar amount to and I think it will take a<br />long time to negotiate this even if they agree to<br />sell. Yes, they must sell it very soon in order<br />to avoid shutdown by law, but I don't think they<br />will.","Kira Liscombe (10%): According to the legislation<br />signed into law that bans TikTok unless sold to<br />a non-Chinese company, the sale deadline will<br />come sometime in 2025. This is after the winner<br />of the 2024 presidential election takes office,<br />which might have an impact on whether or not<br />the ban is implemented. Multiple media outlets<br />reported in April that ByteDance has no plans to<br />sell the platform, and it appears they have made<br />no statements saying otherwise since. Based on<br />this and the fact that Dec. 1 will come before the<br />final cutoff for the sale to occur, I predict a<br />very low probability that ByteDance will announce<br />any deal to sell TikTok.","Vikram Bharadwaj (15%): If this question was<br />asking whether or not Tiktok would be BANNED<br />in the US, there would be an entirely different<br />outlook on this question. However, the base<br />question of whether it will be sold is entirely<br />easier to answer. First off, based on the lack of<br />international precedent, no US law could force an<br />MNC to just be sold, especially when it concerns<br />such a strong international power in China.<br />With a massive decrease in public care for this<br />TikTok ban, it is becoming abundantly clear that<br />Bytedance will not only not sell TikTok, but will<br />likely not even be banned in the US. Financially<br />it doesn't make sense for them to sell this<br />platform when it is in the strongest growth period<br />ever, and frankly there is real chance they will.","Shayna Van Glish (15%): I think that there is a<br />15% chance that there is a deal to sell TikTok,<br />as it does not seem likely that ByteDance will<br />announce before Dec 1. The company has been<br />consistently resistant to selling TikTok and might<br />even prefer shutting it down rather than selling.","Jeffrey Markowitz (25%): There are multiple<br />articles discussing Bitedance would rather shut<br />down tiktok than sell it in december. There have<br />been no updates since.","Brooke McDermott (16%): TikTok representatives and<br />Bytedance representatives have been very resistant<br />to the push that the U.S. government has been<br />pressing on them to sell or they will be banned<br />in the U.S. In addition to this, they are in an<br />on-going legal battle that discusses the first<br />amendment rights of the company in terms of their<br />censorship, and there has been many discussions<br />about data and Chinese involvement. Bytedance made<br />strong claims that they will not sell in April,<br />and more recently have made various statements<br />about their constitutional rights and readmitting<br />their firm stance. Pew Research Center made a<br />study as recently as Sep. 5th that at least 50%<br />of Americans do not think the app will be banned,<br />and additionally, there is a consistent decline<br />in support of the TikTok ban since April. However,<br />the app does receive the most revenue from the<br />U.S. in comparison to other countries. This may<br />lead to some sort of deal in which they sell, but<br />I doubt that this would lead to a deal rather than<br />more time in suits.","Edward L Tsui (15%): Despite 16 billion revenue<br />from US markets, ByteDance, the parent company,<br />prefers a TikTok shutdown in the US if legal<br />options fail come January 25th, 2025 according<br />to Reuters. On April 23rd-24th, 2024 Congress<br />passed a bill to ban Tik Tok in the United States;<br />President Biden then signed the bill. With over<br />30 states banning the app on government devices,<br />and the app being banned by the US military and<br />its members, hope does not look good for the<br />Chinese-owned company. I do not think the US will<br />be successful in a forced sell by December 1st.","Colin Barry (30%): I would say that Bytedance<br />agreeing to a deal to sell TikTok by December 1st<br />would be unlikely, as the company stated in April<br />that they had no plans to sell. This is because<br />the source algorithm the app runs on is allegedly<br />vital to the function of their company, which has<br />made them hesitant to part ways with it. I also do<br />not think that a deal would be made until sooner<br />to the deadline for them to sell, which falls<br />on January 19th. This is almost two months after<br />the December 1st deadline for our forecasting<br />question.","Alexis Frazer (15%): While Biden did sign a law in<br />April of 2024 saying Tiktok will be banned if not<br />sold, there has been little to no indication of<br />urgent plans ByteDance has to sell the app. There<br />is still possibility for it to happen which is why<br />I choose 15%.","Gracie Culpepper (20%): I'm saying 20 because<br />based off of what I read I just don't think it<br />will be super probable. I also think that the<br />election and how TikTok has been in US politics<br />for a minute now will have some affect over this<br />and I just don't think it is super likely.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): ByteDance has explicitly<br />stated their will to not divest from Tik Tok by<br />the January 2025 deadline. Despite the Tik Tok and<br />Fortnite App on the Apple Store being different<br />scenarios, I believe that ByteDance will continue<br />to stand firm despite pressures. ByteDance is also<br />taking this ban decision through the court system.<br />Tik Tok and the DOJ asked for a ruling by Dec. 6<br />meaning the ban could be overturned or confirmed<br />passed the Dec. 1 deadline for this forecast. With<br />the hope of a possible ban overturn by SCOTUS, I<br />do not think ByteDance will change its stance on<br />divestment until the court's ruling.","David Daniels (15%): I don’t think ByteDance will<br />sell TikTok before December 1st because they seem<br />more focused on fighting the U.S. government’s<br />demands rather than selling. They’ve got until<br />January 2025 to either sell or face a ban, so<br />the urgency isn’t immediate. Selling TikTok<br />without its core algorithm is also a headache,<br />and ByteDance isn't eager to give competitors<br />that advantage. The platform makes most of its<br />money outside the U.S., which lowers the pressure.<br />I’d put the odds of a sale happening by December<br />1st at just 15%. This probability of mine is<br />also supported by the notion that ByteDance has<br />outright declared they would rather be banned<br />then sell their controlling interest. My only<br />reluctancy regarding this is rumors of backroom<br />negotiations between American interests and<br />ByteDance.","Findleigh Ague (24%): ByteDance seems pretty<br />adamant that they will not be selling TikTok<br />to a U.S. company. The algorithm that TikTok<br />operates on is crucial to how the app is able to<br />generate revenue and provide for its users, so<br />selling the app to a company that would change<br />its functionality in order to stop storing data<br />and protect Americans’ privacy would completely<br />change how the app works. For this reason, in<br />the case that they haven’t come to any sort of<br />agreement, they wouldn’t want to keep the app and<br />have to change this algorithm in order to keep<br />American customers because they don’t account<br />for that large of a share of their revenue and<br />users anyway. They would rather just let the<br />app be banned in the U.S. because it wouldn’t<br />leave a huge impact on the company. I think that<br />if anything, they might come to some sort of<br />agreement, but I don’t think that they will be<br />selling the app, especially not by December 1st,<br />as they have until January 19th to sell.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (10%): If we are talking<br />about ByteDance announcing to sell TikTok to<br />the US, I am confident that this probably won't<br />happen. ByteDance has said, \"ByteDance doesn't<br />have any plans to sell TikTok.\" That is what gives<br />me confidence. But then again, I do not want to<br />be over confident, so I looked into ByteDance's<br />blog (useless). I also read an NYT article about<br />it. This article gave me a more solid background<br />of why the sale is unlikely rather than only<br />ByteDance's statement. According to the article,<br />if ByteDance were to sell TikTok, companies<br />like Google or Microsoft would be able to afford<br />it, but they are likely to run into antitrust<br />concerns. I think that a global sale of TikTok<br />might be more likely than an US sale.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): According to the research<br />I did ByteDance has no intention of selling the<br />app. These legal proceedings can take a very long<br />time and they do not want to give up what is maybe<br />the most popular social media app available. I<br />just don’t see it happening any time soon.","Leo Zegarra (20%): Because the \"deadline\" to<br />sell TikTok is after December 1st, I truly<br />don't believe ByteDance will announce a deal to<br />sell TikTok before December 1. This is because<br />ByteDance has consistently resisted selling<br />TikTok, showing their dedication towards leaving<br />it be and not really abiding by anyone else's<br />demands. Although the U.S. has put serious<br />pressure for a sale, it also isn;t until some<br />time in January, making it less likely to happen<br />since they would have a a month or so more to<br />arrange for that to occur. Additionally, the<br />geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China<br />add complexity, making it difficult to reach a<br />deal that satisfies all parties involved. Thus the<br />reason for my 20% probability.","Wiliam Willis (33%): I selected 33% probability<br />for this because I don't think it can happen<br />because the purchase makes no sense for your<br />business model or it makes too much sense to be<br />legal. Tik Tok has continued to make revisions to<br />their privacy policy. I believe that this shows<br />that they are motivated to keep the app appealing<br />to Americans. I came up with the number 33%<br />because I don't think that a decision could be<br />made by December 1. I think that the presidential<br />election will play into this and will not be dealt<br />with until afterward. Also the owner of ByteDance<br />said in April that he denies it's willing to sell<br />Tik Tok as US ban looms.","Rommy Etzion (40%): It is not unlikely that they<br />will sell, but I believe it to be more likely<br />that they will refuse and take it to the court.<br />While there are millions of users in the US,<br />TikTok is extremely popular worldwide. They will<br />challenge the ban in court, and if lose they may<br />want to keep their company and accept the US ban<br />on selling. Additionally, President Biden set a<br />January 19th deadline for the sale, right when<br />Bidens presidential term ends. I do not believe<br />that ByteDance will sell Tiktok a month before<br />that deadline, and I don’t believe the United<br />States will place much pressure on them to do so<br />during the height of the election leading up to<br />that deadline.","Abigail Harris (40%): Bytedance has repeatedly<br />claimed they would rather shut down tiktok than<br />sell it to a U.S. owned company. Also, the current<br />wording that Biden signed into law as part of<br />an emergency foreign aid relief package doesn't<br />come into effect until January 19th 2025, giving<br />ByteDance plenty of time to challenge the law<br />on first amendment grounds like they're claiming<br />they want to do or sell Tiktok later on after<br />December. I also don't think this is something<br />the US is going to push in the immediate future<br />seeing as how more than 60% of their stock is<br />internationally owned and in part by Blackrock<br />investing. So it's not like the CIA isn't eating<br />their cake anyway here.","Matthew Harvey (12%): The Chinese company known<br />as Bytedance has already stated that they would<br />rather have TikTok shut down rather than be<br />sold to a US company. Considering TikTok is a<br />major platform for the United States, it makes<br />sense that they would attempt to buy the massive<br />media platform. This comes after the Biden<br />administration created a ban on the app in order<br />to try to force the company to ban the app.<br />Considering the app has control over the data<br />processing of the app and other information they<br />gather. The deadline for Bytedance to sell their<br />app is in April of 2025 and it is incredibly<br />doubtful they will give in to a country they<br />consider to be a rival of.","Minha Ahmad (10%): There is a very low possibility<br />that ByteDance will sell TikTok by December 1st.<br />There have been several reports and articles since<br />April of 2024 stating that ByteDance has no plans<br />to sell, and would rather shut down TikTok in the<br />U.S. if required to than sell their company.","John Mathis (15%): ByteDance has made it<br />abundantly clear that they will not sell tiktok.<br />Additionally, The US isn't even the largest user<br />base for tiktok, and it makes up only a fraction<br />of their total downloads. Additionally, 80% of<br />their sales on the Tiktok Shop come from southeast<br />asia, meaning the US market will not impact the<br />sales of Tiktok as much as people may believe.<br />Given this information, I doubt tiktok will sell<br />before Dec. 1","Victor Avila (30%): In April of 2024, Joe Biden<br />announced that Bytedance has 270 days to sell its<br />recently-emerging, hit social media app, Tik Tok<br />due to the scares of the Chinese government being<br />able to access user-sensitive data. If Bytedance<br />does not sell the app, it will be banned in the<br />United States. Recently Bytedance stated that<br />is does not intend to sell Tiktok especially<br />considering the app reached $16.1 billion dollars<br />in annual revenue. Also, due to tension between<br />China and the United States escalating I do not<br />foresee any leniency for the company when the time<br />comes.","Franco Bravo (25%): Due to the complex<br />geopolitical nature of this deal, I believe<br />that it is highly unlikely that Byte dance will<br />announce a sale by December 1. I do not think that<br />Bytedance will fold to the political pressures of<br />the US government. Additionally, the criticisms<br />that the public has shown has made it even more<br />difficult. iF there is any sale, then I believe it<br />will be postponed and not be announced by December<br />first.","Joe Ornstein (3%): Anonymous sources within<br />ByteDance have communicated that the company would<br />rather shut down TikTok than sell it. TikTok a<br />relatively small share of ByteDance's revenues.<br />Selling TikTok, and, presumably, its algorithm,<br />would endanger its revenues to a much greater<br />extent than just shutting down its US operations.<br />The company is unlikely to pursue a deal prior to<br />the November election, on the theory that Trump<br />would work to reverse (or not enforce) the law if<br />re-elected. And if Harris is elected, 25 days is<br />very little time to negotiate and agree to a sale.<br />Furthermore, there is ongoing litigation, and a<br />judge could rule against the law on 1st Amendment<br />grounds, further delaying a resolution.","Carson Ankeny (10%): Due to public statements that<br />the company would rather be forced to shutdown<br />in the US than be forced to make a sale, I think<br />it is highly unlikely that they sell. Company<br />leadership has been very adamant that a sale will<br />not happen, and for that reason I am not confident<br />that there would be a sale. Their algorithm is too<br />important for them to be willing to sell.","Jessica armour (25%): Throughout all the trends<br />of deaths caused by COVID-19 there has yet to be<br />a week with 3,000 deaths in over a year. The most<br />recent weeks have had less than 1,000 deaths.<br />This leads me to believe that although possible it<br />is very unlikely that the weekly death rate will<br />reach 3,000 by Dec 1. With that being said, there<br />has been an uptick in the amount of COVID cases<br />within the past few months, so the probability is<br />not 0, yet it is still highly unlikely to occur.","Erin Ho (30%): Based on some recent articles and<br />reviewing the past weeks of weekly COVID-19 death<br />rates, I don’t think it’ll reach above 3,000.<br />I think it’ll get close, but not high enough.<br />There are still deaths happening, due to people<br />not getting the updated version of the vaccine<br />nor accessing available treatments for illness in<br />general. However, the last time we got close to<br />hitting 3,000 COVID-19 deaths was January 2024,<br />but since then it hasn’t gotten close at all.","Ryan Foley (15%): Currently, the weekly death rate<br />per 100 thousand people is 300.3. This rate covers<br />the last 3 months which is about the same amount<br />of time before the deadline for this question.<br />This means that the current rate would have the<br />10x before December 1st which is highly unlikely.<br />We have vaccines, better and more accurate<br />screening methods, and more people understand the<br />steps to take when the have Covid. Unless a new<br />mutation on the virus appears that is resistant to<br />the countermeasures we have developed, I don't see<br />a substantial increase in deaths occurring.","Brooke McDermott (18%): Studies show that the<br />death rates per week have been decreasing over<br />the years since vaccines have started to be<br />administered. That being said, there is a lot of<br />fluctuation between seasons and there tends to be<br />a huge peak in deaths around the end of December<br />and the start of January historically. With the<br />introduction of vaccines and other protocols since<br />the start of the pandemic, I believe that the<br />deaths will continue to decrease. That being said,<br />I felt like it was more likely to reach 3,000<br />given past data of spikes in the winter months.","Liv Payne (15%): I find unlikely that we will<br />experience a spike to 3000 deaths per week before<br />December 1st. Looking at CDC data, we can see a<br />trend of deaths decreasing over time. Our last<br />spike was in January of 2023, which was around<br />2500 deaths per week. However, that was following<br />a period of time where the deaths rose from 1400<br />in September. Currently, data is not available<br />for September 2024, so I used data from August to<br />make my prediction. As of August 31, 2.6% of COVID<br />cases resulted in death. In the past three months,<br />most states have had 100-199 deaths from COVID. In<br />the week before August 31, no states were over 8%<br />cases of death, and the majority range from 2-3.9%<br />to 1-9 counts. Therefore, I don't think that COVID<br />deaths will spike to 3000.","Simon Gersten (20%): With the increase in vaccine<br />availability accompanied with more prepared<br />medical units, the likelihood remains low that the<br />death count will reach over 3000 per week before<br />December 1st. While the colder months are likely<br />to increase the death count, it is unlikely that<br />it will go back up to 3000 per week.","Corinne O'Dell (8%): COVID-19 weekly death rates<br />in the United States are not expected to reach<br />3,000 or more per week before December 1, 2024,<br />based on current trends and expert projections.<br />According to the CDC, as of early September,<br />there are about 1,200-1,300 deaths per week​.<br />COVID deaths have been decreasing as time has<br />gone on, and in last December the weekly COVID-19<br />death toll in the U.S. varied, with early reports<br />indicating around 1,500 to 2,000 deaths per week.<br />This all indicates that the weekly rates will not<br />increase to 3,000 or above.","Findleigh Ague (62%): Based on data from both<br />the CDC and Our World in Data, it looks as though<br />COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. are still under 1000,<br />and they've been fluctuating around the 600-900s<br />since July 2024. The most recent data point they<br />have is as of August 31, 2024, there were 663<br />deaths that week. This past week, the percentage<br />of deaths related to COVID-19, was 2.6%. Also<br />this past week, the rate of COVID-19 related<br />deaths per 100,000 population (age-adjusted) was<br />0.2. Although this is true, I feel like it can be<br />pretty easy for the rates to rise to 3000. There<br />still isn't data from the week following Labor<br />Day weekend, so that along with the following<br />weeks could likely showcase an increase in<br />contaminations and then later on deaths because<br />of the increase in travel and gatherings of family<br />and friends. We have also seen nationally high<br />levels of COVID-19 in wastewater (8.82) going<br />into the school season. There was a peak during<br />the summer, but according to Andrea Garcia of the<br />American Medical Association, it's too early to<br />tell if this peak has truly passed. I think that<br />we will have to see how these next few weeks are<br />looking to make a more conclusive statement about<br />this, but regardless, I think it is relatively<br />likely that deaths will rise to 3000 since we<br />know that the virus spreads easily and quickly and<br />does so even more to those with compromised immune<br />systems.","Haley Ford (2%): I put 2/100 mainly based off the<br />weekly data provided by the CDC. The number of<br />COVID cases seem to increase in cooler months,<br />however last December the death count was about<br />1700 dated on December 2nd. (closet data point<br />to the 1st) In January, cases increased but still<br />remained under the 3,000 threshold, maxing out<br />at 2,578 on January 13. Given our forecast ends<br />before December begins, I feel more comfortable<br />putting a lower probability on this forecast.<br />Additionally, this years end of August is below<br />last years.","Gracie Culpepper (5%): I really think this is<br />unlikely. Last year the World Health Organization<br />reported that it was under 3k around this time<br />last year up until the end of 2023 in December.<br />Even throughout this entire year, so far the<br />maximum weekly death rate has not risen above<br />2.8k. I really think this is incredibly unlikely.","Hayden Morehouse (30%): I had a hard time finding<br />research for this but last year the totals did not<br />reach this point so I am going to make an estimate<br />based on those numbers since those would be the<br />most representative for this upcoming year.","Abby Crowe (20%): I predict a 20% chance that<br />COVID-19 weekly death rates in the US reach 3,000<br />or above before Dec 1. The last time covid deaths<br />spiked over 3,000 in one week was in March of<br />2023, over 1.5 years back from now. While covid<br />deaths are spiking because of flu season and time<br />of year, I still find it unlikely that the spike<br />will be that high at any point before December.","Vikram Bharadwaj (25%): I give this prediction a<br />25% confidence rating as compared to the previous<br />year, the number of deaths are down significantly,<br />however with the elections coming up and the<br />potential for many super-spreader like events,<br />there is a real chance that it could break into<br />the 3000s by December 1st. However the main reason<br />for the lack of confidence is the general data<br />trends and lack of a major factor (other than the<br />election) that would cause such a high spike in<br />deaths. If we look back to last year, we failed<br />to even break 3000 until January of this year,<br />much later in the heavy holiday travel season<br />than would be required for this event to come to<br />fruition.","William Willis (23%): I believe that there is a<br />23% chance that the weekly death rate from Covid<br />19 will exceed 3,000. I have reason to believe<br />this because I looked at the death rates per the<br />last 3 years. The last time it was at 3,000 was<br />1/21/23. My reason for selecting this number was<br />because this week is less than it was last year.<br />You catch covid from other people, so the less<br />people that have it, the less chances you have of<br />catching it. If this month is lower than last year<br />that could mean that fewer people could catch it<br />per month than previous years.","Kira Liscombe (12%): According to data I<br />found from the CDC, in late December of 2023<br />provisional COVID death counts by week in the<br />US reached 2,229. More recently in August of<br />2024, provisional COVID death counts by week<br />in the US only reached 663. Trends in United<br />States COVID-19 Deaths show spikes around every<br />late December/early January, but they have been<br />consistently shrinking each year. Additionally,<br />NBC reported that the Food and Drug Administration<br />has been following a routine similar to how the<br />annual flu shot is updated in administering the<br />COVID vaccine. With the presecense of a vaccine<br />this year, and overall low case trends seen in the<br />last two years, I predict a low probability that<br />the COVID-19 weekly death rate will reach 3,000<br />before Dec. 1.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): Weekly death rates have<br />been hovering around 700 for the past few weeks<br />now. There is no reason that should change in the<br />coming months.","Edward Tsui (30%): I think COVID-19 weekly death<br />rates in the United States have a chance to reach<br />3,000 before December 1st. According to the CDC,<br />overall COVID rates have downward trended. Covid<br />tends to soar in the December and colder months<br />of winter. However, I've noticed, that since the<br />pandemic, the rates of August tend to double in<br />the winter. Presently, I don't think the doubling<br />of August 2024 would reach 3,000. New York Times<br />report similar numbers. Overall, I think it's<br />a 50-50, but less than that, so I split the<br />difference and then some.","Shayna Van Glish (7%): I think that is it really<br />unlikely that the COVID-19 weekly death rates in<br />the US will exceed 3,000, as currently the rates<br />are only around 500. While it can increase with<br />flu season approaching, preventative measures will<br />keep it from reaching high levels. There also is<br />the added factor that there is widespread immunity<br />to COVID-19 from vaccinations and prior infection.","Colin Barry (40%): I think that it is about<br />an even chance but am leaning more towards it<br />being less than likely. This is because based on<br />previous years' trends where covid deaths reach<br />their weekly highs in the months following our<br />December1st deadline. However, I do think the<br />chance is as high as 40% since there is a much<br />stronger wave of covid hitting the U.S. currently<br />than there has been in these previously measured<br />years.","David Daniels (2%): I believe the weekly COVID-19<br />death rate in the U.S. will not reach 3,000 before<br />December 1, 2024, assigning a 2% chance. This<br />assessment is based on the observed downtrend in<br />COVID-19 deaths and the fact that monthly death<br />rates rarely exceed 3,000 let a lone weekly.<br />According to CDC data, the downward trend in<br />deaths supports this outlook, and that is why I am<br />confident with my 2% assigned probability.","Matthew Harvey (30%): I believe that there is<br />an unlikely chance that deaths will exceed 3000<br />before December the 1st. While I believe that<br />as we approach fall and colder temperatures<br />and as we approach flu season, sickness will<br />spread faster, I do believe that it is a lot<br />less likely for people to die now from Covid-19.<br />With the production of the vaccine being able<br />to combat the virus and citizens being aware<br />of symptoms, I believe it helps contribute to<br />lessening the factors and severity of COVID-19. I<br />cannot exclude potentials of having outbreaks and<br />flair ups, as well as mutations and more deadly<br />strands to happen. As of right now, according to<br />ourworlddata.org, as of August 18th, there were<br />757 deaths a week. This is down from 883 two weeks<br />prior, I believe this will fluctuate around the<br />upper 100’s and maybe into the low 1000’s, however<br />I don’t believe it will exceed 3000.","John Mathis (40%): Simply put, cases rise during<br />winter and I believe that Covid has reached a<br />flu-like status where a certain amount of people<br />will die from it every year. However, I do not<br />think it will rise enough to pass 3k deaths, as<br />last year it did not and they had a higher death<br />toll going into winter than we do now. It will<br />be close however, so I am putting 40 to hedge my<br />bets.","Oladipupo fashogbon (35%): I took the derivative<br />of the provisional deaths given by the cdc<br />records. I saw based on the most recent data, it<br />shows fluctuations between +36.8% (on 8/24/2024)<br />and -18.3% (on 7/20/2024)., therefore this was<br />abasis for my data.","Victor Avila (40%): I do not believe that weekly<br />deaths from COVID-19 will reach 3,000. It seems<br />as though that COVID is a lot more common during<br />the hotter times of the year, when the virus<br />thrives. Not to mention, it seems like the virus<br />has somewhat stabilized in the recent months and I<br />think it will likely decrease as we head into the<br />winter.","Abigail Harris (30%): We are currently . It's been<br />almost since January of 2023 when a new variant<br />was prevalent, and Covid is growing in 7 states<br />while declining in 16 states, including 3 of<br />the most populous, including California, Texas,<br />and NY. I also don't think Covid will be mass<br />reported or incentivized to be reported by this<br />administration again before the election and Covid<br />and viruses are less active in the winter overall.","Franco Bravo (25%): After having done some<br />research, from the looks of it there has been an<br />increase in COVID weekly rates in the last couple<br />months. However I believe that the rate and number<br />at which COVID is going up in will reach 3000 by<br />December unless something very drastic were to<br />happen","Carson Ankeny (15%): According to all of the CDC<br />data I have seen it seems highly unlikely that the<br />death rate would rise. Especially at this point<br />in the pandemic death rates have been steadily<br />declining and even with a \"school spike\" it<br />doesn't seem likely to reach 3k.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): The last time the weekly<br />death rate was above three thousand was in January<br />2023 and since that December the death rate has<br />not been near 3,000. Unless a new variant strain<br />arises, I think it is very unlikely for the<br />rate to reach above three thousand. Even with a<br />possible spike due to thanksgiving travel, I do<br />not believe it will spike because it did not this<br />past summer either (summer being a season with a<br />lot of traveling).","Joe Ornstein (5%): With such a large share of<br />the US population either vaccinated or previously<br />exposed to COVID-19, the size of the population<br />susceptible to severe illness or death is much<br />smaller than during the past four winters. For<br />death rates to reach this level, either the<br />virulence or case fatality rate would have to<br />increase dramatically compared to last winter<br />(when weekly death rates were less than half<br />that). Current estimates of R are less than<br />0.96, suggesting that at the moment case counts<br />are decreasing. While I expect that value to<br />increase in the coming months, it would require<br />an implausibly rapid increase to see death rates<br />above 3,000 before December 1.","Alexis Frazer (15%): Per CDC data and past trends,<br />in my briefing I cam eto the conclusion that it is<br />highly unprobable for COVID deaths to skyrocket in<br />the upcoming months before December 1st."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.14999999999999999],"y":[3.0038259641733021],"text":"Crowd

Mike Johnson created such a bill but<br />shortly shot it down after failing to receive<br />support from his own party. Democrats on the<br />other hand are only willing to support a spending<br />bill on its own. This leads me to believe that<br />a shutdown is possible but with 2 weeks until<br />the deadline, there is still room for a spending<br />bill to be passed. The 2 most recent shutdowns<br />came about from similar disagreements. One party<br />tried to attach another bill to the funding bill,<br />leading to Congress failing to meet their funding<br />deadline.","Simon Gersten (70%): Given political deadlock and<br />disagreement over key spending issues, a shutdown<br />is likely even if only for a brief period of time.","Abby Crowe (55%): I predict a 55% chance of the<br />government shutting down before Dec 1st. I think<br />it is possible that another continuing resolution<br />could be drafted and passed to avoid shut down,<br />and I find it almost equally likely that it won’t<br />happen. Adding in the consideration of Trump’s<br />rhetoric towards a shut down, I find it slightly<br />more likely that it will occur.","Erin Ho (60%): There is a lot of opposition to<br />the current House bill from Democrats and even<br />a few Republicans, which includes a proof of<br />citizenship mandate for voter registration. This<br />is being heavily pushed by the House Speaker<br />and other Republicans, because they claim it’ll<br />ensure non-citizens won’t be able to vote in the<br />US Elections. However, there is push back because<br />it’s already against the law for non-citizens to<br />vote and congressmen fear that it will discourage<br />other Americans from registering if they lack<br />necessary paperwork. In the end, it really comes<br />down to if both parties are willing to work<br />together to compromise.","Jessica armour (30%): Based on what I have read,<br />if a bill is not passed by Sept 30th then we<br />will lead into a government shut down. However,<br />not only is this going to significantly effect<br />the presidential election, but also so many<br />governmental agencies and considering it is at the<br />end of the year I find it a little hard to believe<br />that it will occur. I am going to say there's a<br />30% chance since this is an election year and that<br />would be so so so horrible to occur. I would also<br />think that the senate would be understanding and<br />make sure they pass a bill before the fiscal year<br />ends considering all of the other stressors this<br />year entails.","Liv Payne (60%): This question is rather tricky.<br />According to an article I read, a shutdown was<br />avoided when Congress approved the 6 remaining<br />bills for the federal budget. However, we are not<br />out of the woods just yet because the House and<br />Senate still have to negotiate a budget that will<br />pass Congress and the President by September 30th.<br />The issue is that, as part of the bill, Republican<br />leader in the House Johnson wants to include<br />a provision that would require people to prove<br />citizenship in order to vote. Not only this, but<br />the proposal would mean nudget cuts for divisions<br />such as education, veterans, the military, etc.<br />This proposal barely passed the House (209-206),<br />with some Republicans defecting and disagreeing<br />with the proposal. One described the proposal as<br />\"dead on arrival\" in the Senate, and Biden said he<br />would veto the proposal if it made it to his desk.<br />Unless Johnson can amend his proposal, it seems<br />like a shutdown is inevitable, and the man seems<br />determined to keep it in. Others, Democrats and<br />Republicans alike, have criticized Johnson for his<br />bullheadedness, but unless he can be convinced,<br />it appears a shut down will occur. I erred on the<br />side of caution, as I feel it is more likely than<br />not, but 70% feels too high and 50% feels too low.","Haley Ford (15%): As September 30th nears,<br />a shutdown seems more likely. However, after<br />hearing forecasts from NPR with Chuck Schumer<br />and based on predictions on FOX9, a shutdown<br />is not likely, and current disagreement<br />is likely has to do more with negotiation<br />tactics. https://www.fox9.com/video/1516770<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/government-shutdown-looms-congress-returns-just-three-weeks-avoid-rcna169620","Corinne O'Dell (35%): Although there is political<br />gridlock in the government right now, they will do<br />whatever it takes for there to not be a shutdown.<br />The next deadline in September 30, and I believe<br />that Congress will pass a version of a short term<br />spending bill. Congress has historically avoided<br />long-term shutdowns by passing short-term funding<br />bills, known as continuing resolutions, to keep<br />the government running. Senate leaders from both<br />parties have already been working on a bipartisan<br />stopgap solution to avoid disruption.","Kira Liscombe (3%): So far, only five of the<br />bills needed to complete the federal budget have<br />passed in the House and none have yet passed the<br />Senate. I saw some reports that the House Speaker<br />made a proposition for a funding extension until<br />March, but its voter registration add-on makes<br />it unlikely to receive Senate support. Since 1980<br />there have been only been 14 funding gaps in the<br />US federal government. Only four of these lasted<br />four or more business days and broadly impacted<br />government operations. It is very uncommon to<br />see an entire federal shut down, and congress is<br />expected to pass a CR by the end of September to<br />avoid a shutdown. They will most likely pass a<br />more short-term extension than proposed by the<br />speaker until the end of December.","Shayna Van Glish (63%): Given that the current<br />situation in the federal government is that they<br />had to enforce a CR, it is not looking good that<br />Congress will be able to agree by the time the<br />funding expires. With partisan disagreements and<br />internal divisions it makes it really hard to come<br />to a terms that people will agree on. Due to this,<br />I think that it is likely there is a shutdown,<br />however, it is not for sure so I am giving it a<br />likelihood of 63%.","Gracie Culpepper (45%): With the election coming<br />up, we don’t know who will be taking office.<br />It is also likely that Congress will not pass<br />the new budget by Sept 30 because of various<br />disagreements. I’m saying 45 because I think it is<br />only slightly less than halfway probable.","Victor Avila (60%): Congress has to pass<br />an appropriations bill to avoid government<br />shutdown by September 30th. As spending bills<br />originate in the currently-republican held House<br />of Representatives, included in the spending<br />bill are provisions enforcing voter ID law<br />regulations, which is a debate amongst republicans<br />and democrats. With the upcoming presidential<br />election, Donald Trump is pressuring republicans<br />to accept a shutdown to make the current<br />administration look bad. I do not think they<br />will receive the needed democrat votes for such a<br />partisan issue during election season.","Minha Ahmad (10%): It is highly unlikely the<br />government will shut down before Dec. 1. The last<br />government shut down was 5 years ago at the end of<br />December and beginning of January of 2018 and 2019<br />because Trump could not agree on an appropriations<br />bill to fund the government for the next fiscal<br />year. I think if the government were to shutdown<br />again, it would be at the end of the year if<br />Biden does not agree on a certain bill for 2025,<br />sometime in December, and not before December 1st.","Vikram Bharadwaj (57.5%): When looking at the<br />question of whether there will be a shut down,<br />we really have to look at the strength of Donald<br />Trump and his control over his own party. During<br />the past few weeks, we had significant cracks<br />within his strength, with notable opposing<br />republicans endorsing Kamala Harris instead of<br />him, yet the power at the end of the day lies in<br />a die-hard Trump supporter in Mike Johnson, and<br />without the Democrats signing on to extremely<br />strict voter identification laws, it is likely he<br />will push the Federal government into a shut-down.<br />However everything can change, just today we had<br />the Second Trump assassination attempt, throwing<br />the potential of him having a larger grip onto his<br />party due to this. With that in mind, and with the<br />insanity that is congress, I give it a 57 and a<br />half chance that the US gov't will shut down.","Jeffrey Markowitz (35%): Not too many signs that<br />the government will shut down, but the government<br />needs to negotiate deals to keep itself funded.","Hayden Morehouse (5%): This is something that<br />almost never happens while we saw a glimpse of<br />this in early 2024 I doubt anything like this will<br />take place in the next few months. I am going low<br />here in hopes to get a good score on this one.","David Daniels (10%): I believe the chances of a<br />U.S. government shutdown before December 1st are<br />quite low. While there have been 10 shutdowns<br />since 1981, most of them occurred before 2000.<br />Only three have happened in the last 29 years,<br />which makes me more skeptical of a shutdown now.<br />Shutdowns during election years are rare because<br />politicians don’t want to hurt their chances<br />at the polls. With elections coming up and the<br />likelihood of short-term funding solutions, I<br />estimate the chance of a shutdown before December<br />at around 10%, based on timing, political<br />strategy, and historical trends.","Colin Barry (40%): I think that a government<br />shutdown is a little less likely to occur than not<br />occur. This is because budget disagreements and<br />disputes in the congress are the main reason that<br />the government would go into a \"shutdown\", but<br />congress has gone into a special meeting recently<br />in order to prevent this from happening. These<br />same concerns almost lead to a shutdown earlier<br />in the year and were prevented and I see a similar<br />situation happening this time.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (40%): Random, but I<br />remember when the government last shutdown. I<br />found this question particularly difficult to<br />answer, as I was unfamiliar with their being talks<br />about Congress shutting down. If I researched<br />correctly, what is threatening the shutdown is<br />the SAVE Act. I don't think it is likely for<br />the government to shutdown because the 2024<br />Presidential Elections are coming up. If I am not<br />mistaken, the past government shutdowns did not<br />occur that close to election season. First I had<br />65% chance, but that fact brought it down. This<br />really depends on how strongly Congressmen feel<br />about the SAVE Act. If they strongly support it<br />and it is not included, will they vote against the<br />bill, even as we approach the elections?","Alex Vrolijk (40%): According to news articles,<br />congress does not seem close to passing a spending<br />bill. There is also contention between the two<br />parties on bills being pork barreled into the<br />spending bill like the SAVE Act, with Democrats<br />openly rejecting any spending bills it is included<br />in. Despite all the conflict and the winding<br />clock, I believe congress will be able to pass a<br />spending bill (or extension) near last minute that<br />will avoid any government shutdown through Dec.<br />1'st.","Leo Zegarra (22%): I’m giving about a 22% chance<br />the U.S. federal government could shut down before<br />December 1, 2024. This estimate takes into account<br />that shutdowns happen occasionally due to budget<br />disagreements and the added tension of an election<br />year. And while shutdowns are not very common, the<br />political heat of an election year can increase<br />the likelihood, though last-minute deals often<br />prevent them. I just think it’s unlikely because<br />lawmakers generally work hard to reach agreements<br />and avoid the disruptions a shutdown would cause.","Franco Bravo (35%): I am not too confident that<br />the US government will shut down, however in light<br />of recent news in relation to JD Vance and the<br />Republican Party push for voter id. However, it<br />being an election year and the election looming<br />around the corner, I believe that if there were to<br />be a government shut down, it would be blamed on<br />the republicans which would bring negative press<br />to the party before the election.","Reece Slater (40%): Speaker Johnson has said that<br />a shutdown is not an option. Also, I considered<br />that Donald Trump is encouraging the Republicans<br />to not agree to a deal unless certain conditions<br />are met. I think this could go either way, but I<br />am leaning towards it not happening.","Abigail Harris (20%): Pew has found that Americans<br />view government shutdowns as a negative thing and<br />that most of them think its a serious problem.<br />In addition to just causing anxiety, Pew has also<br />found that it makes the party in control of the<br />White House and congressional leadership overall<br />look terrible. Plummeting approval ratings are<br />not something any politician wants this close to<br />November in an election year. But after November,<br />what happens if Harris loses and the democrats<br />decide they're going to low ball the incoming<br />administration by leaving them a mess with the<br />next year's fiscal funding? That's really the<br />only big threat I see throwing a wrench in the<br />prediction seeing as how we didn't appropriate<br />this fiscal year until March, six months<br />into it, and have been consistently seeing to<br />appropriations later than it should, especially<br />since 2019 shutdowns under Trump.","Brooke McDermott (75%): There are a lot of talks<br />and seemingly no solutions to the potential<br />shutdown. Additionally, there are pressures from<br />both sides to stop the shutdown , though the<br />pressures from Republican nominees Trump and JD<br />Vance seem to be further complicating the issue.","Matthew Harvey (20%): I believe there is ample<br />enough time for congress to come to a consensus<br />surrounding the government shutdown and passing<br />the bill they are hoping to. GOP members, however,<br />are going to have to compromise and take a lot<br />of harsh voter intimidation laws out of this bill<br />so that it can pass and the government can avoid<br />a shutdown. The issue that democrats and some<br />republicans have with the stopgap bill that would<br />continue the funding of the government agencies<br />is that it has an attached voting rider which<br />requires photo identification in all staters. No<br />government official wants a government shutdown<br />as it paints a largely bad picture for any<br />legislator, however until there are compromises,<br />some republicans are trying to pass legislation<br />that would also postpone the shutdown until after<br />the original deadline.","John Mathis (70%): While this may seem high, I<br />simply do not see a world in which funding is<br />passed. 1. The Election will be a month a way<br />when the government is set to shut down, and<br />republicans in the house would have a vested<br />interest in a shutdown occurring to make Dems look<br />bad at a pivotal moment 2. Freedom caucus members<br />have said that the current plan is far too much<br />money, and they have been the holdouts in past.<br />The only saving grace is the SAVE act, which would<br />require all voters to provide proof of citizenship<br />when voting and would go into place THIS ELECTION<br />CYCLE (insane voter suppression attempt by the<br />way, it’s already illegal for non-citizens to vote<br />and there’s no evidence that undocumenteds vote on<br />a meaningful scale). Trump has fully said that he<br />would encourage people to let the government shut<br />down if the act is not included, and his sway is<br />immense 3. If the SAVE act is included, Biden said<br />he would veto the bill, which I believe because<br />of the huge administrative and political cost it<br />would have so close to an election. So, we have a<br />3 way draw between moderate republicans, freedom<br />caucus, and Dems. I find it quite unlikely that<br />they could agree within those 3 weeks.","Rommy Etzion (38%): Throughout all American<br />History, funding gaps have been more frequent,<br />with 3/4 true government shut downs happening in<br />the past 10 years.","Edward Tsui (75%): The government does not value<br />passing a balanced budget. House Speaker Johnson<br />has removed the SAVE act as of 5 days ago, and<br />negotiations need to happen by Sept 30th when<br />the current CRS expires. Otherwise, the shutdown<br />will happen before the 1st of December. GOP is<br />advocating for shutdown whether from JD Vance or<br />Trump, and neither side wants to negotiate given<br />the timing of the election and the voter proof<br />clause stated in the original SAVE act.","Findleigh Ague (40%): I think that it would be<br />very unwise for Congress to allow a shutdown<br />right before the election. States rely on the<br />appropriations from the government for the<br />elections, so it could allow for insufficient<br />resources and interference with the election. I<br />think that if they don’t agree on a new CR, they<br />at least won’t let the government shutdown long<br />enough for federal employees to be furloughed.","Joe Ornstein (7%): The deadline for new<br />appropriations September 30, and there is little<br />appetite among House Republicans for a shutdown<br />fight before the election---everyone is eager to<br />get back on the campaign trail. The most likely<br />outcome is another clean CR passed with Democratic<br />votes, like we saw earlier this year. Speaker<br />Johnson just needs message a bit about the SAVE<br />Act first.","Alexis Frazer (25%): Government shut downs are<br />commonly used by democrats and republicans in<br />order to negotiate their side of the bargain. In<br />most cases, they end up getting the legislation<br />signed. Also, with the election there is too much<br />on the line for the congressman. Republicans would<br />take the bad PR of shutting down the government<br />(no welfare payments, no social security payments)<br />and it could potentially harm them during the<br />election.","William Willis (40%): The government shut down<br />looks like it will be based on Congress passing<br />a budget or continuing resolution. Political<br />disagreements, particularly over spending<br />priorities, could lead to a shutdown. I highly<br />doubt that it will happen.

The<br />only other issue is the 56 million earned in the<br />original film debut. The projected numbers are<br />still about 15-20 increase in revenue though.","Erin Ho (38%): I haven’t heard any updates since<br />Biden made the announcement in July 2024, so I’m<br />not sure what’s the current state of the reform.<br />It’s a bold decision to make, and allegedly it’s<br />supported by a lot of the registered voters in the<br />US, but there’s other fish to fry with the House<br />and Senate not trying to shut down the government<br />and the Presidential Election in November. I<br />think, depending on how the election turns out and<br />the next funding bill, there could be movement on<br />it.","Joe Ornstein (0%): It is implausible that SCOTUS<br />reforms like the ones President Biden proposed<br />over the summer (term limits, a binding ethics<br />code) would pass a Republican-controlled House<br />of Representatives. Speaker Johnson called the<br />plan \"dead on arrival\", to which Biden bizarrely<br />retorted \"I think that's what he is...dead<br />on arrival\". None of this is particularly<br />conducive to passing legislation---much less<br />a constitutional amendment, which is what such<br />reforms would likely require.","Abby Crowe (5%): I predict a 5% chance that<br />supreme court reform will be signed into law<br />before December 1st. I find this highly unlikely,<br />due to the current lack of momentum for the<br />issue with all the election buzz. Biden made a<br />big statement back over the summer, but this is<br />not an issue Harris has been leaning in on, so<br />even if she wins the presidency and has influence<br />post-election, I still don’t believe reform is<br />coming any time soon.","Ryan Foley (10%): Supreme Court reform is a<br />largely partisan debate, with primarily democrats<br />pushing the issue. We see in today's court how<br />their decisions have not aligned with much of the<br />American public's views, especially in regards<br />to abortion and presidential immunity. For reform<br />to be passed it would require a constitutional<br />amendment or new legislation. I highly doubt that<br />a new amendment would be able to be passed, as<br />2/3 of the states would not agree to term limits.<br />The other option is new legislation. First, a law<br />would need to get past both the House and Senate.<br />Currently, Republicans hold the House and the<br />Democrats hold a slight majority in the Senate.<br />If people voted strictly on party lines new reform<br />legislation would not pass. On the chance it does<br />however, the Supreme Court could strike down that<br />legislation through judicial review. This leaves<br />a very low chance of reform being passed with both<br />methods being easily blocked.","Minha Ahmad (40%): In July, President Biden<br />proposed several reforms. However, these are more<br />long-shot moves since his reforms would require<br />congressional approval and do not seem likely<br />to be passed by December 1st. In 2021, Biden<br />created a commission to study structural changes<br />in the Supreme Court, which has not been passed<br />to this day. In terms of reform being pushed by<br />the Court or past decisions being overturned, the<br />Supreme Court Justices are a Republican majority,<br />and do not seem very likely to push for reforms,<br />especially those being requested by the public,<br />like reinstating Roe v. Wade. However, at the same<br />time, you never know what may happen, which is why<br />my guess is less than 50% but not extremely low.","Brooke McDermott (5%): This is pretty unlikely<br />to happen until at least after the election,<br />and after that, most of the bills that have<br />been proposed haven't even made it to committee.<br />Additionally, there's mixed support on the<br />reforms, and I think there's going to be a lot<br />of back and forth on reforms and what that needs<br />to look like going forward. I feel that we could<br />see term limits in the future, but definitely not<br />before Dec 1.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): While this is something<br />that Biden has talked about doing in the past<br />I do not see this happening in the time frame<br />given. There are alot of hoops to jump through to<br />get this done and I am thinking the left is more<br />concerned with the campaign trail currently than<br />getting this done.","Jessica armour (15%): Considering the election and<br />the turmoil a Supreme Court reform would cause, I<br />think it is highly unlikely that a reform would be<br />signed into law at least not by Dec 1. With that<br />being said, the majority of news posts that have<br />been made about this seems to have been created<br />earlier in the year. Along with this, a reform of<br />the Supreme Court would definitely cause problems<br />between the three branches as well as between the<br />Democratic and Republican parties.","Simon Gersten (0%): This will not happen. Neither<br />party is seriously considering the idea, there is<br />no broad, outspoken support for this issue and no<br />real bill has undergone any processes to make this<br />reasonable in the timeframe.","Shayna Van Glish (5%): I think that it is really<br />unlikely that the Supreme Court reform will be<br />signed into law before Dec 1. Specifically, due to<br />the timeline it would take to pass this not being<br />able to be executed in the upcoming deadline.<br />Also, it would require both House and Senate<br />approval and with the Republicans controlling the<br />House it seems highly unlikely.","Gracie Culpepper (10%): I think this proposal<br />reads really well and would be beneficial for our<br />judicial branch, however, I don't think that this<br />is going to pass right now. Especially with the<br />election coming up, I really don't think this is<br />going to be Congress's primary focus.","Liv Payne (20%): Looking online, there doesn't<br />seem to be much talk about Biden's reform in<br />recent weeks. Most of the articles I found are<br />from a month ago or earlier, making me think<br />that discussions have died down around it. Biden<br />has proposed 3 reforms, one of which directly<br />affects the Supreme Court, of which 6 are<br />Repbulican-appointed. Even if the reform made it<br />all the way to the SCOTUS, it seems unlikely that<br />it would pass. And if it did, I don't believe it<br />will happen before December.","Kira Liscombe (1%): I think its very unrealistic<br />that a bill establishing 18-year terms for Supreme<br />Court Justices and requiring the President to<br />appoint a Supreme Court Justice every two years<br />will not pass at a time like this so close to<br />the election. I found information that Democrats<br />and Republicans are farther apart ideologically<br />than they’ve been in the last 50 years, according<br />to an analysis by the nonpartisan Pew Research<br />Center. This means its very difficult for the<br />bipartisanship necessary to push legislation<br />through congress. Even though most Americans<br />support ending life tenure, there is little<br />history of court reform in America. I also saw<br />alot of negative news about it, especially Bidens<br />recent hypocritical comments on Mexico's court<br />reform. The issue is too polarizing right now to<br />pass, at least not in the next three months.","Corinne O'Dell (5%): Supreme Court reform is<br />unlikely to be signed into law by December 1,<br />2024, due to significant political opposition<br />from Republican lawmakers. Proposals such as<br />term limits and a binding ethics code face strong<br />resistance, and passing such reforms would require<br />bipartisan support, which is currently lacking.<br />Additionally, more substantial reforms, like<br />term limits, would necessitate a constitutional<br />amendment—a long and complex process. The divided<br />political landscape makes it improbable that these<br />changes will move forward quickly​.","David Daniels (2%): In order for reform like this<br />to pass it would require either a Constitutional<br />Convention (IE the states call for a vote, 2/3<br />required to pass) or both chambers of legislation<br />need to pass a Constitutional Amendment (which<br />also required a 2/3 majority) to pass. The last<br />Constitutional Amendment was in 1992, and for<br />good reason, partisan bills don't often get a<br />2/3 majority. In addition to needing to pass the<br />senate, this bill would also need to pass the<br />house, where the majority leader Mike Johnson<br />has stated that the president's plan is \"dead on<br />arrival in the House.\" The likelihood of this bill<br />passing is \"highly unlikely\" as described by left<br />leaning media such as CBS (democrats being the<br />ones trying to push this reform). This reasoning<br />has landed me on a probability of 2%.","William Willis (10%): I gave this question an<br />10% probability of occurring, The reason that I<br />said this number was because on the constitution<br />website it said the debate over Supreme Court<br />term limits and the ways to implement them are<br />unlikely to fade from the court of public opinion.<br />This will be very hard thing to decide. I really<br />think that this is taking a jab at Trump and if<br />this will require a lot of time to review. The<br />most recent article I could find on it was July<br />31, which means that there has not been much media<br />discussion about it.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): With the election<br />upcoming, there is little chance of the law being<br />signed into law. After November 5th, there would<br />be a very small amount of time for the proposed<br />reforms to become a law.","Vikram Bharadwaj (10%): I find it incredibly<br />unlikely that Supreme court reform will even see<br />the light of day on the floor, let alone pass<br />through both Senate and the House and be signed<br />into law. The fact of the matter is, supreme court<br />reform would directly harm a more conservative<br />court in Robert's court, and it is extremely<br />unlikely that any republican in their right mind<br />would even support this bill, let alone vote for<br />it. Even across the aisle, many democrats feel as<br />though this is a politically charged proposition<br />and are thus heavily opposed to it. As such I am<br />giving it a 10% chance of occurring.","Victor Avila (10%): With the current Supreme Court<br />reaching its lowest approval rating in history,<br />at 38% according to a Fox News poll, major powers<br />are pushing the idea of Supreme Court reform.<br />President Biden and Vice President Harris have<br />both come out in support of reform with common<br />interest in term limits, but I do not think it<br />is likely that Supreme Court reform is likely to<br />happen. Optimists forget this needs congress’s<br />approval and it seems that republicans won’t give<br />up the power they have in the court.","Leo Zegarra (10%): Due to the lack of urgency, the<br />slow legislative process, and really mainly the<br />fact that there's split partisanship I give the<br />probability a 10%. Even if there were bipartisan<br />support, the legislative process is slow and<br />complex, requiring months or even years to pass<br />significant changes. With other priorities like<br />the economy and budget taking precedence, it's<br />highly unlikely that Supreme Court reform will<br />happen before December.","Abigail Harris (20%): Biden mentioned these<br />reforms (no POTUS immunity, term limits, and a<br />binding code of conduct) a lot more around the<br />time Trump's legal escapades were more present<br />in major media outlet coverage this year. Term<br />limits might mean constitutional amendments which<br />are a lengthy process on their own and just a<br />few states can cause major stalls like with the<br />ERA which ultimately failed. That would require<br />congress and state legislatures to stand behind<br />the POTUS before a potential Trump presidency or<br />when his own party sees him as a sitting duck,<br />warming the office for his own VP. I think the<br />larger disapproval ratings around SCOTUS due to<br />misconduct of the financial and sexual varieties<br />are important factors in mounting social change<br />but ultimately won't be reflected so quickly in<br />the legal world. The political world is gridlocked<br />and highly polarized, and these reforms would<br />require popular support in an election year from<br />all sides, something that just isn't likely to<br />happen before December.","Edward Tsui (5%): The general election is<br />too close by, and this is a partisan inspired<br />legislation idea that will not pass a simple<br />majority vote in the Republican controlled House.<br />Assuming negotiations work between the House<br />and Senate, the issue is polarizing enough that<br />a 2/3 vote override is not possible in both<br />chambers if Trump were elected come November.<br />His power wouldn't even start anyways until<br />January. However, the only way this bill passes<br />if Kamala wins and the House flips, which makes me<br />think that the likelihood would only be possible<br />post-election, after the inauguration, and not<br />by Dec 1st. Most proposed bills die in Congress,<br />especially politically divisive ones; the current<br />Supreme Court ideology lean benefits Republican<br />ideals and is bragged about by President<br />Trump. The numbers in favor of reform are like<br />multiplying pennies together with limited time,<br />motivation, and compromise.","Rommy Etzion (8%): The term limit for justices and<br />the immunity aspect would require a Constitutional<br />Amendment. To get an Amendment, given the<br />construction of the current House and Senate<br />would require significant bipartisan cooperation,<br />requiring a ⅔ vote in both the House and the<br />Senate. A Constitutional Convention is untested<br />and uncertain, and in my opinion unlikely to<br />happen before December 1. Ratification is an even<br />more difficult process, and I do not believe we<br />would even make it to that stage. Historically,<br />of about the 11,000 amendments proposed to<br />Congress, only 27 have been successfully ratified.<br />Many amendments have taken years and decades<br />to be ratified. With extreme polarization and<br />partisan divisions in the states and Congress,<br />as well as resistance to change, it is incredibly<br />unlikely. It being an election year, and currently<br />mid-September, that division is heightened.<br />Members of Trumps party would be extremely<br />reluctant to agree to this proposal, especially<br />with the timing.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (20%): Finding current<br />news for this was so difficult. After Biden<br />announced it, I remember everyone talked about<br />it, and then its popularity fizzled out. There<br />are three reforms listed on Biden's proposal.<br />In 2021, the reform was unlikely because Senate<br />had a Republican majority which is not the case<br />today. However, the House of Representatives today<br />has a Republican majority, making it difficult<br />to pass. I find the \"binding code of conduct\"<br />to be more feasible than the other two proposed<br />reforms, as it could possibly have bipartisan<br />support. All things considered, I think the reform<br />is very unlikely. First, I do not believe this<br />is Congress' #1 priority. As we learned in last<br />class, they have to figure out the budget bill,<br />and that is more important than Supreme Court<br />reform. Biden is also in his lame-duck period. I<br />do not know how effective Congress is right after<br />elections. If the Democrats sweep the elections<br />and gain control of the House, keep control of the<br />Senate, and win presidency, then I can see a form<br />of reform being likely.","Alexis Frazer (5%): The enforcement of term<br />limits on the Supreme Court will not be passed<br />in the foreseeable future given the makeup of<br />the court and congress. Roberts is against the<br />code of conduct, but it is still voluntary and<br />somewhat weak. I put a 5% probability because the<br />likelihood of this legislation being signed that<br />quickly is very slim.","John Mathis (1%): Given the Republican majority<br />in the house who will not support Supreme Court<br />reform due to Republican control of the court<br />right now, as well as an incredibly slim majority<br />in the senate, it is unlikely that any meaningful<br />legislation, especially one with term limits,<br />could be signed into law.","Haley Ford (10%): A code of ethics seems more<br />likely than justice election reforms. Much of<br />the public, on both sides, has felt that Supreme<br />Court reform in one way or another is needed.<br />However, with the highly partisan house and<br />senate changes could take longer than by December<br />1st. Additionally, some perspectives think such<br />a proposal in July is a campaign strategy and<br />would likely not take its course until the new<br />presidency.","Alex Vrolijk (1%): I think it is highly unlikely<br />that any Supreme court reform gets signed into law<br />by Dec. 1. Biden announced his plans for supreme<br />court reform after he dropped out of the 2024<br />election race so I believe it may be an empty<br />political promise. This is because I believe<br />any supreme court reform bill/proposals will<br />face a very long line of political scrutiny and<br />feasibility meaning it will take a lot longer than<br />2.5 months let alone the rest of Biden's term.","Matthew Harvey (0%): This is reform that<br />definitely needs to occur and while I believe<br />most individuals think the supreme court is a<br />branch that needs checking, it is almost next<br />to impossible to have any kind of reform while<br />working with a partisan congress. Getting any<br />kind of legislation passed that would reform<br />foundations laid out in the constitution is<br />almost next to unheard of during this time due<br />to a highly polarized society. in order for any<br />reform to be passed, it would have to get through<br />the House and the Senate with a high majority in<br />both, which no party has control of currently.<br />The other option would be for the appointments<br />of new judges to the supreme court (due to the<br />understanding that there is no limit to the amount<br />of supreme court justices allowed), however this<br />is seen as court packing and Biden who believes<br />in the traditional sense of the system wouldn't<br />attempt to do this in the case that a successor of<br />his might try the same thing in order to keep the<br />majority in their favor. This would also require<br />a rigorous process that takes a while to get done.<br />This, I believe, is more a project for someone<br />starting out their presidency or those running<br />for a second term and have that be what they work<br />on. All in all, the process of vetting a candidate<br />takes a while (something that cannot occur by the<br />December deadline). It also must be considered<br />of other issues or things that could arise that<br />might require him putting this on the backburner.<br />I wouldn't be surprised if he announced this<br />reform in order to garner support and turn this<br />over to a Democrat successor should he/she win.<br />https://sites.google.com/site/thepoliticsteacherorg/what-are-the-chances-of-reforming-the-supreme-court","Reece Slater (12%): I don't think it will happen.<br />I don't think anything will actually be put into<br />place, I just think it's a solid talking point<br />for politicians. Also, leading up to the election,<br />I don't think Biden wants to do anything crazy.<br />While it is true that he has nothing to lose since<br />he's not running for reelection, I don't think<br />anything will be put into place.","Findleigh Ague (15%): I doubt that the reform<br />that Biden wants like term limits and enforceable<br />ethics codes and even amending the constitution to<br />prevent presidential immunity will even be able to<br />pass the Republican-majority House. I think that<br />he won't have trouble getting Democratic support,<br />but it doesn't seem likely to happen in only a few<br />months.","Franco Bravo (25%): I believe that court reforms<br />will not be signed into law before December first<br />for several reasons. One of the main reasons<br />being is that this bill will and has faced severe<br />backlash and resistance from the republican party.<br />Some sources I have seen have labeled it \"Dead on<br />Arrival\" so it seems very unlikely that this would<br />get signed by December First","Carson Ankeny (5%): I think it is highly unlikely<br />that any of President Biden’s proposed reforms<br />pass through Congress prior to Election Day,<br />and I think it’s even less likely that lame<br />ducks would waste political capital voting on<br />it in late November. These issues are considered<br />controversial and I don’t think it’s likely that<br />this Congress does anything about them seeing as<br />they haven’t since these ideas were proposed in<br />late July.","Hayden Morehouse (80%): I am taking a risk here.<br />There is alot of excitment for Moana 2 as the<br />first one was an instant disney classic. I am<br />hoping those fans show out in full force the first<br />weekend this movie comes out and gets the box<br />office numbers up.","Abby Crowe (65%): I have determined that there is<br />a 65% chance the Moana 2 will outsell the original<br />film in the box office in its opening weekend.<br />This prediction is based on a number of factors<br />including general sales of sequels, release<br />timing, celebrity voice acting, and overall impact<br />of the original film at the time of release and in<br />the time since.","Kira Liscombe (85%): The original Moana film<br />made $56,631,401 domestically in its opening<br />weekend. The biggest box office debut of the<br />year so far was Inside Out 2 with $154,201,673<br />domestically. The first Inside Out film came<br />out in 2015, very close to when Moana came out,<br />and made $90,440,272. Moana 2 only needs to make<br />(less than) half as much as Disney's top film<br />of the year to beat it's original film opening<br />weekend. On top of this, Moana 2 will release<br />over Thanksgiving weekend, which is normally a<br />very popular time for going to the movies. On<br />the contrary, numbers for Disney movies have been<br />dropping with last year's Wish only receiving<br />$19,698,228 over a thanksgiving opening. I still<br />predict there is a high chance Moana 2 will surpas<br />its original film in the box office, especially<br />since the Moana 2 trailer is the most watched<br />disney animated trailer in 24 hours at 178m views<br />and Moana was the most streamed movie of 2023 in<br />the United States across all platforms.","Erin Ho (68%): The first Moana movie earned $56.6<br />Million during its opening weekend in 2016, which<br />happened to be during Thanksgiving. It is one<br />of their highest grossest films for Thanksgiving<br />Weekend, right below Frozen as the highest.<br />Moana 2 will also open during Thanksgiving<br />weekend, which allows more people to see it since<br />they’ll be free. Currently, most of Disney’s<br />highest-grossing films are sequels and remakes of<br />their originals, with notable titles like Inside<br />Out 2, Frozen 2, Incredibles 2, and the Toy Story<br />sequels surpassing their originals.","Ryan Foley (80%): With the hype around Moana 2<br />it seems fairly certain that it will surpass the<br />original in its opening weekend. Moana 1 was one<br />of many people favorite Disney movies to come out<br />in the past few years, and pulled in about $60<br />million in its opening weekend. I feel like it<br />will have the same effect Inside Out 2 had, with<br />many of its original viewers having now grown<br />up and have a connection with the film that will<br />bring them back to watch the sequel. Inside Out 2<br />nearly doubled its original's box office. Frozen<br />2 did the exact same thing, more than doubling its<br />original's opening weekend. Due to this, I feel it<br />is safe to say Moana 2 will follow suit.","William Willis (20%): I feel that it is highly<br />likely for Moana 2 to beat the original Moana<br />during the opening weekend when it comes to<br />earning from the box office. During 2016 movie<br />theaters were a lot more popular than streaming<br />services. Now since covid everyone has streaming<br />services and people go to the movie theaters a<br />lot less. With that being said I think that a lot<br />of people will wait for it to appear on streaming<br />services and watch from the comfort from their own<br />home.","Brooke McDermott (99%): Various older Disney<br />animated film sequels surpass the opening<br />box office weekend of the original movie.<br />Additionally, Moana 2 was the most streamed movie<br />of 2023. CNBC predicts that the sequel will join<br />\"Disney's billionaire club\" alongside Inside Out<br />2.","Colin Barry (95%): The first Moana made roughly<br />$248 million at the domestic box office during<br />its original theatrical run in 2016. I think that<br />there is good reason to believe that the sequel<br />will top this performance when it releases later<br />this year. The first piece of evidence is that<br />Disney animated sequels do tend to outperform<br />their predecessor, looking at the recent success<br />of Inside Out 2 as an example. Another is that<br />with 187 million views in 24 hours, the trailer<br />for the sequel became the most viewed in that time<br />span in Disney's history. This is why I think it<br />is very likely that the sequel will outperform the<br />first in the U.S.","Findleigh Ague (90%): Out of the top 10 highest<br />opening weekends in the U.S. of all movies, 6<br />are sequels. Out of the top 10 highest opening<br />weekends in the U.S. of just Pixar movies, 6<br />of them are also sequels. 3 of those have been<br />released after the first Moana. There are 6 Pixar<br />movies with sequels (Toy Story and Cars have<br />multiple), and all 6 of those movies' sequels did<br />better in the box office on their opening weekend<br />than their first movie. After writing all of<br />that, I realized that Moana is not a Pixar movie<br />but it's a Walt Disney Animation Studio movie.<br />I'm still going to keep what I wrote because it<br />still supports my point. If it were Pixar, I would<br />give it a 100% probability. Walt Disney Animation<br />Studios's films don't surpass historic box office<br />points like Pixar's do. Frozen II and Ralph Breaks<br />the Internet are some Disney Animation films that<br />have done so, and I think that they are in the<br />same market as the viewers of Moana. Moana first<br />premiered in 2016, and the sequel comes out this<br />year (8 year gap). Frozen came out in 2013, and<br />its sequel came out in 2019 (6 year gap). Also,<br />both movies include girl main characters, both<br />are musicals, and both have some sort of magic<br />involved in their storyline too. I mention this<br />because these movies are inherently very similar,<br />and if Frozen II could surpass its original with<br />a big gap in between the two, then Moana could too<br />with a slightly longer gap.","Jessica armour (95%): Based on an article from<br />business insider Disney sequels within the past<br />two decades have ALWAYS (or almost always) made<br />more than the original. They even say that if a<br />sequel doesn't make more than the original in box<br />office sales that the whole series is basically a<br />failure. Along with that, Frozen 2, the lion king<br />2, so many sequels of other Disney movies have<br />made soooooo much more than the original. Moana<br />itself was such an incredible movie and I know it<br />was so popular with the younger generations so I<br />think its a very safe bet to assume it will earn<br />more!","David Daniels (86%): After Disney's great success<br />with 'Inside Out 2\" I would say that it is<br />possible Disney animated will be able to get a<br />Billion dollar box office out of the new Moana<br />2. From what I have seen, the market seems to be<br />in agreeance that this will be a great revenue<br />stream for Disney. An interesting thing I saw<br />was the correlation between trailer views (across<br />all notable platforms) and initial popularity<br />in theater. In the first 24 hours of the trailer<br />being announced it accumulated nearly 200 million<br />views across major platforms, which is more<br />than Infinity War (2017). Movie critiques are in<br />agreement that this film will be more popular than<br />Moana, which consistently sits in the top streamed<br />movies on Disney + year after year. I'd say that<br />this is a strong bet that Moana 2 will earn more<br />in the opening weak, hence why I assign a 86%<br />probability.","Liv Payne (80%): In 2016, Moana was released<br />on November 23. With a budget of $150mil, it<br />made $82mil in its opening weekend. Moana 2 is<br />slated to occur over a 3 day weekend on Nov 23,<br />which could be cause for a higher turnout. With<br />this new wave of modern disney princesses, it<br />is actually quite hard to tell how well Moana 2<br />will do. Our only real comparison is with Frozen,<br />which was released Nov 27 2013. With a budget of<br />$150mil, it only made $243 thousand in its opening<br />weekend. However, its sequal did significantly<br />better. Still with a budget of $150, Frozen 2 made<br />$228.2 mil in its opening weekend, which - if I<br />did my math right - is almost a 9400% increase.<br />Unfortunately, there is little data for Moana 2<br />available at the moment. Searching for its budget<br />only reveals that it went up by $75mil earlier in<br />the year. If we go on the assumption that Disney<br />has found a sweet spot with $150mil, then perhaps<br />that means the new budget is $225 mil. A similar<br />film could be Inside Out, which had a budget of<br />$175mil and made $90.4mil in its opening weekend.<br />Inside Out 2, with a higher budget of $200 mil,<br />made $155 mil in its opening weekend. Granted,<br />throwing money at something doesn't mean its<br />going to do better. Disney has a history of making<br />sequals that pale in comparison to the original<br />(The Little Mermaid, Cindarella, The Hunchback<br />of Notre Dame, etc), but it seems like we have<br />entered a new era of sequals with actually good<br />storylines. Overall, even with limited data, it<br />seems like Moana 2 is going to follow the current<br />trend Disney has going for sequals. They are<br />certainly doing better than their newer original<br />stories (*cough* Wish *cough* didn't even make $20<br />mil in its opening weekend with a budget of $200<br />mil *cough* *cough*).","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (95%): Walt Disney<br />Studios has actually only ever released one<br />sequel in movie theatres. That movie was Frozen<br />2. Frozen 2 generated more money than Frozen 1 in<br />its opening weekend, making it one of the highest<br />grossing animated films of all time. Now, if we<br />include Pixar Studios, the number of sequels (I'm<br />counting the first sequel) increases to 6. These<br />movies include: Toy Story 2, Cars 2, Incredibles<br />2, Inside Out 2, Monsters University, and Finding<br />Dory. All of these sequels, for the exception<br />of Toy Story 2, earned more at the box office<br />in their opening weekend. Toy Story 2 apparently<br />was initially released in only one movie theatre,<br />so that explains its low opening weekend box<br />office. However, overall in the domestic box<br />office it earned more than the first movie of Toy<br />Story. According to ScreenRant, Moana was one of<br />the most watched movies in 2023. Additionally,<br />this movie is coming out during on the week of<br />Thanksgiving. It is the only movie coming out<br />that week, so there is less competition in the<br />market. The only other two PG rated films that<br />will be relatively new in theaters include Wicked<br />and Spellbound. These will be released the week<br />prior. Interestingly enough, Wicked was scheduled<br />to be released on November 27, but this month they<br />moved its release date to November 22, fearing<br />that Moana 2 would over take them in the opening<br />weekend. Based on this evidence, I feel strongly<br />about Moana 2 earning more than Moana 1.","Vikram Bharadwaj (95%): Not only did Moana 2<br />break Disney's record for most streamed trailer<br />in a 3 day period, it is predicted to be one of<br />the biggest movies of the year. With this giant<br />coming right off the heels of not only a notable<br />IP, but also a massive hit in Inside Out 2, there<br />is an amazing chance that it will blow the 56<br />million dollar opening weekend out of the water.<br />On top of this, Disney sequels that hit the<br />screen have always outperforms their original by<br />a good margin. On top of that the actual projected<br />figure sits at around 80 million, which many<br />critics claim to be on the conservative end. Not<br />to mention the slot has it in a prime position to<br />completely level the playing field as there are<br />truly no other good animated movies coming out<br />thanksgiving, likely due to the fact that MOANA<br />TWO is coming out.","Jeffrey Markowitz (70%): Frozen 2 made way more<br />than frozen 1 opening weekend. Moana 2 looks like<br />its set to make a big debut.","Gracie Culpepper (70%): I'm going to say this is<br />pretty likely because Moana is one of the most<br />streamed movies in the world, and also projections<br />show this movie doing really well in its first<br />week. It's also currently the most watched<br />animated Disney trailer within its first 24 hours<br />of release. I think this has a high likelihood of<br />earning more the second time around!","Reece Slater (85%): I looked at many previous<br />animated Disney films with sequels and every<br />single one of the sequels beat the original film<br />in box office sales in the opening weekend. Frozen<br />2, Inside Out 2, etc.","Leo Zegarra (77%): I believe that there's a<br />pretty high chance that Moana 2 will earn more<br />in its opening weekend than the original Moana<br />because of the growing popularity of the original<br />film and also due to the usual trend of Disney<br />sequels performing great and even better than the<br />original in the box office. Sequels from Disney<br />often perform well at the box office due to brand<br />trust and family appeal, and this was shown with<br />the Frozen collection. Additionally, Moana 2 is<br />poised to attract large crowds since the Disney+<br />subscription has given access to films that the<br />newer generation of kids may not have seen in<br />theaters. Finally, the fact that the movie will<br />release on Thanksgiving weekend helps with its<br />performance in the box office since families<br />are more inclined to go to the movies on holiday<br />weekends.","Edward Tsui (75%): According to business insider,<br />sequels are more popular now than ever before.<br />The trailer for this movie broke every record for<br />Disney, and the trading odds are 63% for Moana 2<br />to out gross Moana overall. I am leaning towards<br />the fact that the trailer and movie may be first<br />billion dollar movie for Disney since Frozen II,<br />and I think this movie has a loyal fan base based<br />on the quality of the first movie.","Shayna Van Glish (77%): I think that Moana 2 has a<br />77% probability of earning more than the original<br />film due to the anticipation of fan nostalgia.<br />Moana 2 has an advantage in attracting new fans<br />while also having its original fans. If Moana 2<br />receives positive feedback, there is a good chance<br />it will exceed the opening weekend box office than<br />the original.","Alex Vrolijk (85%): This is because Moana is very<br />popular and I believe there to be a bigger Moana<br />fan base hoping to watch Moana 2 opening weekend<br />now compared to the Moana movies release weekend.<br />Frozen 2's opening weekend box office sales were<br />almost double that of Frozen and I expect to see<br />something along the lines of that for Moana 2 as<br />well.","Victor Avila (90%): I believe Moana 2 will do<br />better opening weekend at the US box office,<br />compared to Moana 1, making 56.6 million USD.<br />The reasoning is because not only did Moana 2’s<br />trailer broke Disney’s record with 178 million<br />views in 24 hours, but also the audience will be<br />a lot more familiar with Moana now, and would go<br />see it on opening weekend. Also sequels tend to do<br />better regarding opening weekend attendance.","Alexis Frazer (85%): The original Moana was the<br />most streamed movie of 2023, there is a pattern<br />of sequels outperforming their predecessor opening<br />weekend as seen by Frozen and Toy Story, the 8<br />year gap between the two movies allowed for Moana<br />to grow its fan base.","Corinne O'Dell (75%): Moana 2 became the most<br />watched Disney trailer with 178M views in 24<br />hours. Disney has also not had a 1 billion dollar<br />animated movie in 5 years, which makes me think<br />they are pushing very hard for this to happen.<br />People are also returning to the movies after<br />COVID, so I believe Moana 2 has a good chance at<br />breaking the record.","Abigail Harris (90%): Sequels on average often<br />perform better than their original counterparts.<br />This is because of marketing and established fan<br />base, and how well the original was received.<br />With a movie like Moana it’s not a gamble to say<br />Disneys marketing is sufficient with the most<br />watched trailer in Disney animation history which<br />is INSANE. They beat inside out 2 for trailer<br />views already and that’s disneys 4th highest<br />grossing film of all time. It’s a pretty done<br />deal, my only hold up is if it happens that<br />weekend.","Franco Bravo (55%): I am relatively unsure about<br />this question as I have heard compelling evidence<br />for both arguments. However there seems to be<br />strong buzz around the movie and with an increased<br />budget there seems to be a better chance than it<br />not","John Mathis (40%): Sequels rarely make more than<br />the original film, simply because you have less of<br />a market because your audience is mostly reliant<br />on people who have seen the first movie. However,<br />I moderate closer to fifty just because Disney<br />is a powerhouse in the industry, and actually has<br />multiple sequels with higher opening weekends than<br />the original.","Matthew Harvey (85%): I believe that when it<br />comes to most sequels, they tend to have a high<br />chance of being successful in their box offices<br />on opening weekend (especially if the 1st garnered<br />a lot of attention and fame). When it comes<br />to Disney movies, the impact it has on younger<br />viewers allows it to increase in popularity and<br />influence and thus increase viewership. I gave<br />15% less than certain due to being certain but<br />allowing for error.","Haley Ford (100%): The success of all the Disney<br />sequels, #1 streamed movie 2023 US, success of<br />Inside Out 2,","Carson Ankeny (92.5%): There are many reasons why<br />Moana 2 is likely to be more successful. inflation<br />is a factor + sequel to a popular movie + release<br />date which historically is a successful release<br />weekend for movies + the actual projected figure<br />i found online is about $30M higher than the<br />original film","Sara Whitmire (43%): To make my prediction, I<br />will compare Moana to the Frozen franchise, which<br />contains a relatively similar plot that breaks<br />the tried-and-true Disney movie 'formula' and<br />came out around a similar timeframe (Frozen II<br />came out 9 years after the original, and Moana has<br />been out for 8 years, among other similarities).<br />While it is not an exact comparison, I believe<br />that it will inform my decisionmaking. Moana made<br />$56 million in its opening weekend, and Frozen<br />made 67 million; Frozen II, once released, made<br />$228 million. To me, the Frozen franchise is an<br />anomaly that can't be exactly replicated. The<br />Moana franchise, while successful, will likely not<br />produce a sequel more popular than the original.<br />The plotlines were pretty clearly wrapped up<br />in the first movie, and a sequel feels a bit<br />unnecessary. There isn't as much of a fandom<br />presence to buoy ticket sales. I think it will<br />be successful, but not more successful than the<br />original.","Simon Gersten (65%): Because of inflation, hype<br />surrounding the movie it makes it a possibility.<br />However, Disney movies recently have done horribly<br />because they are all woke, so it is possible that<br />it is a dud.","Joe Ornstein (60%): Opening weekend gross as a<br />percent of a film's production budget is roughly<br />lognormally distributed around 40%, with a 95%<br />confidence interval between 14% and 108%. It's<br />difficult to get definitive numbers on how much<br />Disney spent producing Moana 2, but we know<br />that it was originally slated to be a streaming<br />release, so it hasn't had as much investment as<br />an ordinary theatrical release. Most estimates<br />that I find suggest that it has the same or a<br />slightly smaller budget than Moana (2016), so it's<br />essentially a 50-50 shot that it will exceed the<br />original's opening weekend box office. Same stars,<br />same weekend, different director. I don't know. It<br />could just not be very good, and if so there are<br />other kid-friendly movies that parents can take<br />their kids to see on Thanksgiving."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.40000000000000002],"y":[2.9729878039564936],"text":"Crowd

They have been favored to<br />win the most seats in this election all the way<br />back to 2022 and are in line with the rise of far<br />right parties in other European countries. Because<br />of the longstanding prediction of their expected<br />majority, I expect a high chance.","Brooke McDermott (85%): The FPO has shown positive<br />growth in approval ratings and polls since the<br />beginning of the month. Additionally, the outgoing<br />chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has seen an increase<br />in disapproval of his leadership since he started<br />his chancellorship in 2021. Nehammer belongs to<br />the OVP, the other Austrian far-right party, which<br />has not gained as much traction from the media<br />in terms of the race. I do think the prevalence<br />of FPO's breakthrough/predicted success is due to<br />their historical win in the EU Parliament in June,<br />which could also be contributed as to why everyone<br />believes they are going to gain the majority of<br />seats for the national election.","Gracie Culpepper (42%): Although they are leading<br />in the polls right now, it is unlikely that the<br />FPO party in Austria will actually win a majority<br />of the seats. There has been a big push throughout<br />Europe though for more right-wing parties to<br />stop immigration, so I don't think this is highly<br />unlikely.","Colin Barry (60%): I think it is slightly more<br />than likely that the FPO will win the most seats<br />in the election for the first time in its history.<br />As OVP has been trending down in polls ahead of<br />the election while FPO has stayed strong in its<br />numbers for the most part. However, I do not think<br />they will win enough seats for a majority in the<br />government this election.","David Daniels (82%): Based on current projections<br />and polls, it seems likely that the FBO will win<br />more seats than any other party. All the sources<br />I've found agree that the FBO will be the leading<br />party. Therefore, I estimate a 82% probability of<br />this outcome.","Vikram Bharadwaj (85%): FPO currently leads the<br />polls by a significant margin of 3%, and with the<br />general downward trend for the OVP along with the<br />overall increase in far-right populist parties<br />across Europe, I find it heavily likely that<br />the FPO will win the most seats out of any other<br />party. Now it is realistic that there could be<br />a sudden OVP victory with them winning the most<br />seats, but I personally find that highly unlikely<br />as most news agencies along with the polling<br />data project the FPO to come in with the historic<br />victory.","Alex Vrolijk (85%): This is because the FPO has<br />been leading Australia's public polls for a year.<br />The FPO has also grown a gap between themselves<br />and the second place OVP. Due to European<br />sentiment shifting further right due to factors<br />including immigration, I believe the FPO will win<br />more seats than any other party.","Minha Ahmad (48%): According to Euronews, the FPO<br />is currently leading in the polls. However, they<br />are leading with 28%, so even if they win their<br />share, they are not likely to get a full majority.","William Willis (40%): At the moment it looks<br />like the FPO is leading in the polls with a 28%<br />of the vote. But it seems that it needs to find<br />a coalition partner in order to govern. I also<br />highly doubt that they will win because they have<br />never won in history. I highly doubt that they<br />will be able to form a coalition.","Victor Avila (68%): Although I could not find<br />much information on if a party can still win the<br />most seats and not rule, I gave the FPO winning<br />more seats than any other party a 68 percent<br />probability. On the Austrian polls that I found,<br />it seems like the FPO is ahead at 27% with the OVP<br />trailing behind at 24% with the OVP party approval<br />rating falling and anti-immigration/refugee<br />rhetoric on the rise, I find it likely that like<br />will occur.","Liv Payne (70%): In 2019, the FOO had 31 seats,<br />putting it at third place behind the OVP and SPO.<br />Since then, the two other groups have made some<br />political decisions that have not curried favor<br />within the public, meaning their approval rates<br />have dropped significantly. According to a poll by<br />The institute for Demoscopy and Data Analysis, the<br />OVP has dropped from over 40% in 2020 to barely<br />25% in September of 2024. SPO now sits at around<br />20%. The FPO leads with around 27%, and all other<br />polls have shown support for the far right group.<br />Therefore I find it more likely than not that the<br />fpo will have more seats than the other groups,<br />but it is important to recognize that having more<br />seats is not equivalent to the majority. In order<br />to have a majority and the Austrian Parliament<br />a group needs to have 92 seats, which according<br />to the data I was able to collect for my power<br />went out, it's not something that has happened in<br />recent years. In 2019, the OVP had 71 seats, but<br />I don't believe that the FPO will gain that many,<br />even if they do win the most number of seats.","Leo Zegarra (78%): The FPO is likely to win<br />more seats than any other party in Austria's<br />September elections, and I gave it a 78% chance<br />of happening. This reflects their strong polling<br />performance and voter sentiment favoring their<br />stance on immigration and economic issues, amid<br />dissatisfaction with current ruling parties.<br />According to the most recent 4 elections, the<br />party that has polled the best ended up winning<br />more seats than any other party in each election.<br />However, the OVP party is the incumbent party and<br />also is neck and neck in terms of polling. Either<br />way, I now know that people are not particularly<br />content with that party and want a new party in<br />the majority since the OVP have had more seats<br />since 2017.","Joe Ornstein (68%): Public opinion polls in<br />Austria are historically quite accurate, and the<br />fact that parliament is elected by proportional<br />representation means that translating vote shares<br />into seat shares is straightforward. For the<br />first time in history, the far-right FPO has<br />consistently been leading in the polls, though<br />their lead (about 1-2pp) is well within the margin<br />of error and has been shrinking over the past few<br />weeks.","Alexis Frazer (72%): From what I’ve researched,<br />the FPO party is favored to get a majority in the<br />upcoming election and currently holds 30 of the<br />183 seats, and won 16.2% of votes cast in the 2019<br />legislative election and it is represented in all<br />nine state legislatures."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[1,1,0.84999999999999998,0.98999999999999999,1,0.96999999999999997,0.69999999999999996,1,1,1,1,1,0.98999999999999999,1,1,1,0.90000000000000002,1,0.98999999999999999,1,0.96999999999999997,0.80000000000000004,0.98999999999999999,1,0.75,1,0.97999999999999998,1,0.80000000000000004,0.94999999999999996,0.89000000000000001,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.84999999999999998,1,0.59999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.96999999999999997,0.84999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.87,1,0.94999999999999996,0.91000000000000003,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.75,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.87,0.94999999999999996,0.75,0.83999999999999997,0.94999999999999996,0.80000000000000004,0.87,0.80000000000000004],"y":[1.9854392878478393,2.0047771147917954,2.0078589702490719,2.0481653383933009,1.9595573233906181,1.9961965882917867,1.961402628524229,1.95731511216145,2.0324317580787463,1.9690049594268202,1.9658025782788173,1.9858417785260827,2.0079381005140022,1.9632723636692391,1.9659207007847725,1.9611259145196527,1.9803617841564118,2.0116564547177402,1.9786526901880279,1.968448636843823,1.9623946557985619,2.0150719579076393,1.9763258836930617,1.9664389731362462,2.0368219815660269,1.9726192666450515,2.0300402962835506,1.9538001893321053,2.0081093112938104,1.9950743520632386,1.9574162114411593,2.0271318280138075,2.0292853547260163,2.0092597552808003,0.99881968731060622,0.96913260999135675,0.97264726192224771,0.97872045300900934,0.98972300128079949,0.96929008008446549,0.95473877149634068,1.0135666189948096,1.0211746403016151,0.96258300365880134,1.0077906252117828,1.0222931117750704,0.96961283185519276,1.040114479395561,1.042318741325289,1.0176960476208479,1.0037804441293701,0.9592332727508619,1.0320895309792832,1.0313763252226635,0.97539253921713676,0.95415613269433375,1.0070916084805503,0.95716649882961069,0.99911927420180291,1.0008517675567419,1.0144758269423619,1.0270629607373849,1.0372008982812986,1.0158115192549304,0.95549338113050908,0.97074698235373946],"text":["Erin Ho (100%): I have no clue if this was a<br />mistake, but Haiti’s 2024 inflation rate is<br />already above 10% and is projected to stay around<br />23-24% until 2025 and onwards. If we’re talking<br />about 2025 and onwards, I think it has a pretty<br />good chance of getting lower and lower, but if<br />it’s just this year, it’s not going down.","David Daniels (100%): The current inflation is<br />already above 10%. I believe they are currently<br />sitting at 23% inflation year over year. This was<br />taken straight from the IMF. Since this question<br />has already come to be, I put the probability at<br />100.","Brooke McDermott (85%): Haiti's political climate<br />is still very volatile, which ultimately isn't<br />leading to a very stable or successful economy. I<br />compared the prices to some products from the last<br />two years to this year, and ultimately they seem<br />the same. IMF estimates that they'll be around<br />14%, which I think could be accurate, but with the<br />state that they're in right now it doesn't seem<br />probable that they'd dip below 10%. Additionally,<br />their main focus right now seems to be working<br />on humanitarian efforts due to a large number of<br />unhoused and struggling Haitians.","Ryan Foley (99%): Currently the Haitian inflation<br />rate is sitting around 30% as of the most recent<br />data from July 2024. Looking to the past the last<br />time the inflation rate dropped below 10% was in<br />2015. With the inflation being higher than that<br />point for nearly a decade straight, I don't see<br />it returning there in the next few months. With<br />the government also collapsed and the country<br />essentially being run by gangs, there would<br />need to be a miracle for the inflation rate to<br />substantially drop.","Abby Crowe (100%): I give a 100% probability<br />that Haiti’s 2024 inflation rate will be greater<br />than 10%. The current rate is about 30%, and<br />even though it is trending downwards, it will<br />not be able to drop below 10 before our December<br />deadline.","Kira Liscombe (97%): Haitis all time inflation<br />rate high was 49.30% in January of 2023.<br />Additionally, inflation in Haiti averaged 25.2%<br />in the ten years to 2022. The inflation rate<br />this year started at 20.95%, and has only grown<br />since reaching 30% in July. I looked at a 10 year<br />spread, and the last time the inflation rate was<br />below 10% was in July of 2015. Since there is<br />clearly an upward trend in inflation in recent<br />months, i think its very likely that Haiti's 2024<br />inflation rate will be greater than 10.","JESSICA ARMOUR (70%): Yes Haitis inflation rate<br />will increase, based on the articles I have read,<br />since 2023 Haitis inflation rate has consistently<br />been increasing, therefore it is safe to assume<br />that it will be grater than 10%. the inflation<br />rate has been more than 10% since 2023.","Shayna Van Glish (100%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />currently sits 28.3%, making it really likely<br />that it will stay above 10% through the end of<br />the year. Economic instability and factors such as<br />political unrest and insecurity continue to drive<br />this high inflation.","Liv Payne (100%): According to the IMF, Haiti's<br />current inflation rate is at 23%. Though this is<br />down from its peak in 2022 at 44.1%, inflation has<br />not been near 10% in recent years. Other sources<br />have similar data, and predictions still put the<br />inflation rate well over 10% carrying into the<br />next year. *site note, this is on the assumption<br />that the question is meant to conclude by December<br />1st, but the question is not clear.","Alexis Frazer (100%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />in 2024 is expected to exceed 10% due to a<br />combination of ongoing economic instability,<br />political unrest, and external shocks. The country<br />has been grappling with supply chain disruptions,<br />a weakened currency, and high import dependency,<br />which drive up the cost of goods. Additionally,<br />Haiti's inflation rate has consistently been<br />greater than 10% for the last 6 years and the<br />likelihood of it decreasing is next to 0. The<br />lack of effective government measures to stabilize<br />the economy and control prices contributes to the<br />persistent inflation, keeping it well above 10%.","Wiliam Willis (100%): At the current moment<br />Haiti's inflation rate is greater than 10%. In<br />the IMF world Economic Outlook it says that the<br />inflation rate and average consumer prices is at<br />44.1 for 2024. The projected inflation rate is<br />23% for 2024. That is a clear indicator that the<br />inflation rate will be above 10%.","Vikram Bharadwaj (100%): With the most recent<br />Haitian annual inflation rate from April 2023<br />to April 2024 standing at 27.3 percent, and the<br />current projected inflation rate being greater<br />than 20, I find it literally impossible that Haiti<br />is able to overcome this inflation rate within the<br />last 3 months. They have struggled significantly<br />domestically with being able to contain the<br />ongoing gang war (shoutout barbecue) I find it<br />immensely unlikely that haiti will be able to<br />contain this out of control inflation within the<br />year. With that being said, there is a possibility<br />that Haiti's inflation rate recedes, but asking<br />it to quite literally be cut in half is asking the<br />impossible.","Colin Barry (99%): I predict that the inflation<br />rate of Haiti will almost definitely reach higher<br />than 10% as the inflation rate of Haiti been<br />trending upward in recent years, with it being<br />over 10% each of the last few years. According to<br />the IMF measures for the inflation rate of each<br />country, the inflation rate has already reached<br />over 10% for the year and I see no reason why the<br />rate would see such a drastic drop by the end of<br />the year to fall under 10%.","Corinne O'Dell (100%): In recent years, the<br />Haitian inflation rate has been over 30%. In July<br />of 2024, the inflation rate was 30%. There is<br />nothing indicating that this rate will go down any<br />time soon, especially not anything under 10%.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (100%): As of 2023,<br />Haiti's inflation rate was at 36.81%. From what it<br />looks like in the IMF Country Data, the inflation<br />rate for the average consumer is at 44.1%. The<br />inflation for end of period consumer prices is<br />at 38.7%. I am not sure what the difference is<br />between both, but for a fact both of them are<br />above 10%. The last time inflation was under 10%<br />was in 2015. I do not see an indication that the<br />inflation rate will be below 10%.","Ladi Fashogbon (100%): Haiti’s inflation rate<br />is projected to remain well above 10% throughout<br />2024, with a 100% certainty of exceeding this<br />threshold. The current rate in 2024 stands at<br />44.1%, following 46.4% in 2023. The average<br />inflation from 2020 to 2024 was approximately<br />33.5%, reflecting a continuous upward trend.<br />The CPI for July 2024 reached 413.30 points,<br />increasing steadily since June. Haiti's dependence<br />on imports, political instability, gang violence,<br />and global disruptions, continue to drive<br />inflation. The depreciation of the Haitian gourde<br />and food inflation at 42.3% further contribute to<br />the economic challenges. With no signs of easing<br />inflationary pressures, the political and economic<br />conditions point to a 100% likelihood that Haiti’s<br />inflation rate will remain above 10% in 2024","Alex Vrolijk (90%): Haiti is recovering from some<br />very severe inflation, peaking in 2023. A model<br />predicting Haiti's inflation for 2024 is 23%. The<br />same model does not even predict Haiti's inflation<br />falling below 10% through 2029, but trying to<br />forecast years in the future is very difficult and<br />not reliable often times.","Reece Slater (100%): Although Haiti's inflation<br />rate is on a decline since a spike in 2023, there<br />is no chance it falls below 10% by Dec 1. IMF<br />World Economic Outlook has them listed at 23%<br />as of April and I see no path for them to fall<br />under 10% by Dec 1. Every statistical model I<br />have examined has them well above 10% in 2024,<br />including IMF themselves.","Rommy Etzion (99%): According to the IMF, the<br />current projected rate is 23%. From 2003-2024,<br />inflation in Haiti has averaged 15.62, which<br />is well over the 10% cutoff. The inflation rate<br />MoM, which measures the change in prices of goods<br />and services from month to month is 1.0-1.1%,<br />which does not indicate much of a change from<br />the projected 23%, and not a high enough one that<br />would indicate it being less than 10%.","Vikram Bharadwaj (100%): Given that from July<br />2023-24, the inflation rate sits at well above 20<br />percent and the current projected inflation rate<br />is more than double our projection limit of 10,<br />I find it significantly implausible that such an<br />event could occur in which inflation in Haiti dips<br />below 10% by the end of the year. Truly for such<br />an event to happen, the universe must be praying<br />on the downfall of my brier score.","Franco Bravo (97%): Due to Haiti already having<br />a very high inflation rate, it is expected for<br />it to go up even more due to economic factors and<br />overall political instability.","Victor Avila (80%): The international monetary<br />fund (or IMF) puts out a biannual world economic<br />outlook. I could not find the exact dates when<br />the seasonal editions come out, but I did find<br />that there is a fall and spring edition. That<br />being said, most sources I researches stated that<br />Haiti’s inflation rate is moving in between 25%<br />and 30% for the past 2 years. With the most-recent<br />edition coming out soon, I believe it is 80%<br />likely that the IMF will rank Haiti’s inflation<br />above 10% in this upcoming edition.","Sara Whitmire (99%): Haiti's 2024 inflation rate<br />is set at about 30% as of July of this year due<br />to weak domestic production and budget deficits,<br />among other factors. There doesn't appear to be<br />any improvement on the horizon for this inflation.","Abigail Harris (100%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />is not predicted to dip even below 15% by the<br />IMF before the end of this year. The lowest<br />inflation rate we're predicted to see even into<br />2025 is 11.5% which is still comfortably over 10%<br />given the volatility of the Haitian economy. The<br />inflation rate in Haiti also hasn't been under 10%<br />since before 2024 which doesn't exactly suggested<br />a sharp change in trend anytime soon.","Haley Ford (75%): Haiti's current inflation rate<br />is 23%, a steep drop from the previous peak of<br />44%. However, with the continued gang violence<br />and political unrest, the inflation rate would not<br />likely drop below 10%, even if it did drop;.","Carson Ankeny (100%): Per my understanding and<br />discussion with clsssmates, this has already<br />happened. So I am putting 100%. Even if it hadn’t<br />already happened, trends would indicate that it<br />would be well above 10%.","Matthew Harvey (98%): Haiti's inflation rate<br />between 03-24 of the 20th century has averaged<br />15 percent or higher and that is do to having to<br />compete and keep up with global rising prices.<br />While having to adjust their interest rates due<br />to national trading, their economy is incredibly<br />reactionary. According to statista, the inflation<br />rate of Haiti is roughly 24% and while they will<br />be dropping from that extreme value, it is not<br />projected to fall under the margins of what the<br />forecasting challenge requires of it. It takes a<br />substantial amount of time for inflation rates to<br />rise/fall with over a 10% difference which would<br />be required to bring down Haiti's. It is easier<br />to track the month to month inflation rate of<br />Haiti and the biggest jump recorded this year was<br />from March to April when it went down by a change<br />in 2.9%. However if it were to continue with<br />this trend, it still would not drop below 10%.<br />https://www.statista.com/statistics/575624/inflation-rate-in-haiti/<br />https://tradingeconomics.com/haiti/inflation-rate-mom","Gracie Culpepper (100%): I really think that<br />Haiti's inflation rate will be greater than 10%<br />because it is already higher than that and by a<br />very large amount. It's been in the 30s earlier<br />this year, and although it is projected that it<br />will fall over the next 5 years, I don't think it<br />will reach below 10% by the start of the new year.","Edward Tsui (80%): Haitis inflation rate has hit<br />record numbers this year, and it has been growing<br />since 2003. Even if the rate were to decrease,<br />it is statistically unlikely for the rate to drop<br />back down to 10% or lower before Dec 1st given<br />the current political dilemma in the country. The<br />trends in CPI do not fall that quick In a matter<br />of two-three months. Furthermore, trends show it<br />around 14% if it decreases but I think it will<br />actually get higher in the next year.","Simon Gersten (95%): Their inflation rate reached<br />30% in July and remains high, making it highly<br />unlikely they will be able to lower it by the end<br />of the year.","Leo Zegarra (89%): I strongly believe that<br />there’s a high chance that Haiti’s inflation<br />rate will exceed 10% in 2024, based on current<br />economic conditions and projections from reputable<br />institutions like the IMF, specifically. I gave<br />it an 89% chance. This high probability is due to<br />the fact that the country currently dealing with a<br />combination of economic instability, supply chain<br />disruptions, and political unrest, all of which<br />contribute to persistent inflationary pressures.<br />These factors, along with currency depreciation,<br />make it highly probable that inflation will<br />remain above 10%. The IMF’s 2024 forecast of 12.7%<br />inflation further solidifies this expectation,<br />suggesting that economic recovery will remain a<br />challenge for Haiti in the near term. That gives<br />the margin of error around 2.7%, which I think is<br />large enough to make this forecast come true.","Findleigh Ague (95%): Haiti's inflation rate has<br />been greater than 10% since 2016. Additionally,<br />the IMF World Economic from earlier this year<br />(April 2024) states that Haiti's inflation rate<br />was 23%. I just don't think it would be possible<br />for it to drop below 10% before it is updated<br />again or even by the end of the year.","Joe Ornstein (95%): The April 2024 estimate from<br />the IMF for Haiti's annual rate of inflation was<br />23%, and historically the spring estimates have<br />been strongly correlated with fall estimates.<br />Haiti has undergone a series of severe economic<br />and political crises over the past 10+ years,<br />including earthquakes, hurricanes, COVID-19,<br />and the assassination of its former president.<br />Currently the country is grappling with gang<br />violence with the help of a Kenyan-led UN<br />peacekeeping mission, but it will be a long road<br />before the government can maintain basic security.","Hayden Morehouse (85%): The Haiti inflation rate<br />is currently sitting around 23%. In the past Haiti<br />has been known to have a high inflation rate and I<br />believe that this trend will continue.","Kira Liscombe (100%): Per the Israeli electoin<br />cycle, the next general elections are formally<br />scheduled for October 2026. I found alot of<br />research suggesting that the Isreali public<br />generally disproves of Netanyahu's leadership<br />since the Hamas attack in October. Netanyahu is<br />Israel's longest-serving prime minister and has<br />repeatedly ruled out early elections. Even though<br />there have been some calls for it, i think its<br />very unlikely to see any changes in the next vote<br />for parliament. Under the law, a prime minister<br />can only be declared unfit for office by themself<br />or a two-thirds majority of the cabinet, and an<br />Israeli prime minister has only previously been<br />declared unfit for office once in 2006. Israel<br />is in the midst of a war that is unlikely to<br />end soon, and I doubt there will be a change in<br />leadership this year.","Ryan Foley (60%): Since the beginning of the war<br />between Israel and Hamas, Netanyahu's support has<br />wavered. In a CNN article from January of this<br />year, there were calls from 40 many high ranking<br />Israeli citizens regarding Netanyahu being removed<br />from power. As the war continues Netanyahu's<br />approval has consistently fallen. With information<br />about the atrocities of the war reaching the<br />public, much of the world has condemned the<br />country. With the war now expanding into Lebanon<br />and more civilians being killed this will likely<br />tank public perception of Israel further. However,<br />both Israel and the US continue to push forward in<br />the war, disregarding much of this criticism which<br />leads me to believe that Netanyahu could still<br />hold on to his position.","Erin Ho (70%): Based on the lack of alternative<br />candidates within Netanyahu’s party, the Likud,<br />and uncertainty about the future, Netanyahu will<br />likely remain the Israeli Prime Minister. That<br />said, there is a lot of criticism towards the lack<br />of security that caused the October 7th attacks,<br />not to mention all the hostages still left<br />unsaved.","Abigail Harris (90%): An outside force like the<br />American government, a known Israeli backer,<br />or the UN likely wouldn’t try to remove any<br />world leader in the middle of a major conflict<br />especially one which amounts to armed conflict.<br />Biden isn’t likely to attempt to remove him<br />because of the upcoming election despite tensions<br />over hostage recovery. The people in line to<br />replace Netanyahu include economic and foreign<br />affairs ministers from his own party but with the<br />next election in 2026 and tensions likely to only<br />grow deeper the longer conflict rages on I feel it<br />would only benefit them to wait.","Minha Ahmad (80%): I would say that it is highly<br />likely that Benjamin Netanyahu will still be<br />the prime minister of Israel by December 1st.<br />According to the Times of Israel, the next<br />election for Israel will not be until 2026, and<br />government officials and members of parliament<br />have stated that Netanyahu will stay prime<br />minister until the war in Gaza is over. It is<br />unlikely that the war will end in the next couple<br />of months, especially since Israel has began to<br />attack other countries in the Middle East, like<br />Lebanon, and has refused to agree to several<br />ceasefire pleas and pleas from organizations like<br />the United Nations who have voted for an end to<br />the war.","Hayden Morehouse (90%): The next election is<br />not until 2026. That means he would have to be<br />impeached or killed in the conflict. While I think<br />the probability of that is low it is never 0 hence<br />why I left some room here and picked 90.","Colin Barry (90%): I would say it is pretty likely<br />that Netanyahu will still be in power by December<br />1st, as during his recent term several laws have<br />been put into place to make it harder to remove<br />him from his position. The next general election<br />for prime minister in Israel will not be until<br />2026, which would be the next best chance for him<br />to leave or be removed from office. Since I do<br />not think it is likely he will be removed over the<br />next two months.","Brooke McDermott (90%): I highly doubt he will<br />step down, additionally Israel parliament formed<br />a law last year that made it incredibly hard to<br />impeach or remove the prime minister from office<br />without HIS affirmation or 3/4 of his cabinet. I<br />think if the U.S. were to back another coalition<br />to complete with Netanyahu, it would be after the<br />president next year is inaugurated.","Abby Crowe (95%): I give a 95% probability that<br />Netanyahu will still be the Israeli PM on our<br />deadline. While many have been protesting his<br />government, it is unlikely to change anything<br />because of the wartime aspects surrounding the<br />country. Governments are unlikely to turnover<br />during war time, he regained political capital<br />with the sophistication of the Lebanon pager<br />attacks, and there is not a rescheduled election<br />until 2026. Even if elections were called, it<br />is unlikely that it would follow through before<br />December.","David Daniels (97%): Benjamin Netanyahu is<br />currently the longest-tenured prime minister.<br />While some people are calling for his resignation,<br />it seems unlikely that Israel would risk<br />a government change in the midst of a war,<br />especially considering the timeliness of the<br />matter, as it needs to be resolved before<br />December. Another thing to consider is that<br />the next election isn't until 2026. Given these<br />factors, my estimation of a 3 percent error is<br />only based on the chance of him passing away while<br />in office. I find this very unlikely and assign a<br />97% probability that Benjamin Netanyahu will still<br />be in office come December.","Jessica armour (85%): The Prime Minister of Israel<br />can remain the Prime Minister indefinitely. With<br />that being said, it is unlikely that Netanyahu<br />will not continue to be Prime Minister as his term<br />has not been completed yet and the election for<br />the Knesset will happen in a few years. Therefore<br />with the war and the election being so far away he<br />will most likely still be in office by December.","Simon Gersten (70%): Base off of the current rate<br />at which the war is going, Netanyahu is likely to<br />maintain his coalition, but if events go sideways,<br />he will lose his coalition and a new vote will be<br />placed. I do now think this is likely.","Corinne O'Dell (90%): Benjamin Netanyahu is likely<br />to remain Israel's Prime Minister by December<br />1, 2024. Netanyahu's leadership is currently<br />reinforced by the ongoing war following the<br />October 7 Hamas attacks, as he has been able<br />to unite much of the country under a wartime<br />government. Israel's next elections are not<br />scheduled until October 2026, so there is a high<br />probability Netanyahu will remain til Dec. 1.","Shayna Van Glish (87%): I think that there is an<br />87% probability that Netanyahu is still in power<br />on Dec 1. It is highly unlikely that there would<br />be a vote of no confidence or collapse of the<br />coalition by this date. While he is very unliked<br />by many citizens, it is not likely that a new<br />coalition will be formed by Dec 1.","Jeffrey Markowitz (100%): There is no chance that<br />he will be removed from office at this point by<br />anything short of a coup.","Vikram Bharadwaj (95%): The fact that Netanyahu<br />is currently stiff PM signals the fact that there<br />is no real chance that he would willingly step<br />down. There is no reason for him to, along with<br />the fact that he essentially has no opposition<br />within his base due to the their strong support<br />for the current military operations. The Knesset<br />knows that any change to leadership now is a<br />terrible idea for every given operation and is not<br />at all in the best interest of national security.<br />The only reason why I shy away from 100% is the<br />5 % chance that Netanyahu dies, either by age or<br />assassination which I feel given the significance<br />of the war.","Leo Zegarra (91%): I gave this question a 91%<br />chance. Benjamin Netanyahu seems to be very<br />confident that h will remain Israeli Prime<br />Minister for some time and I don't see any changes<br />happening by December 1st. His current coalition<br />is stable, and no immediate elections are planned,<br />which is a huge factor for me. Many reports also<br />also display Netanyahu as being very politically<br />resilient.","Alexis Frazer (90%): Benjamin Netanyahu is likely<br />to remain Prime Minister on December 1 due to his<br />political acumen, a solid coalition, and ongoing<br />support from key voter bases. Despite challenges,<br />his administration has effectively navigated<br />economic and security issues, allowing him to<br />maintain influence and control within Israel's<br />complex political landscape.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (90%): Netanyahu has held<br />office since 2009. Officially, the next elections<br />will be held in 2026. After reading up on some<br />facts, I learned that Netanyahu has lost some<br />popularity in Israel. Some people have called for<br />early elections. However, I do not think this is<br />an immediate cause for concern. I think that the<br />process for an early election would take a longer<br />time than what we have.","William Willis (80%): After researching the<br />following question for our class on will Benjamin<br />Netanyahu still be the Israeli Prime Minister on<br />Dec 1, I have come to the probability that there<br />is an 80% chance that he will still be the prime<br />minister by Dec 1. I have concluded that as long<br />as the war is going on he will remain in power.<br />The war has almost been going on for a year. I<br />think the reason why he will remain in power is if<br />the war continues and it seems like there are no<br />signs of it slowing down.","ladi fashogbon (75%): Netanyahu currently holds<br />office and has significant political experience,<br />having been Prime Minister multiple times. There<br />is too much political instability to replace him.","Rommy Etzion (95%): Check Briefing :)","Victor Avila (95%): The reason I gave this a 95<br />percent probability is because I find it highly<br />unlikely that Netanyahu will be out of office, in<br />which he would have to call an early election and<br />lose it. Chuck Shcumer has called for Netanyahu<br />to call an early election and believes they<br />must elect someone else to deal with Hamas in<br />which Netanyahu refused to commit to holding<br />new elections when the war winds down and said<br />Schumer's comments were \"totally inappropriate.\"<br />Not to mention Netanyahu has just only started<br />escalating war in Lebanon so I find it highly<br />unlikely he holds early elections.","Matthew Harvey (95%): The probability that<br />Netanyahu stays in control is incredibly high.<br />First and foremost, Israel is in the midst of<br />a full on war with Lebanon. Whenever wars and<br />conflicts occur in any government, the worst<br />thing to do is to transfer power over and hold an<br />election. Look at in the past when Roosevelt held<br />power during the events of WW2. By transferring<br />power, it could cause turmoil and instability that<br />could lead to issues. Another reason why Netanyahu<br />will stay in power is due to his massive support<br />from the government. While the people of Israel<br />might not have faith in him and disapprove of<br />the government, those in power currently rally<br />behind Netanyahu and his values. I have no doubt<br />that while this conflict goes on and there is<br />instability in the Middle East, he will remain in<br />power.","gracie culpepper (87%): After doing research<br />and using wisdom of the crowd, I think more than<br />likely he will still be the prime minister by the<br />start of December. In order for him to not be,<br />there would have to be some form of annexation or<br />military coup, which I think is strongly unlikely<br />to occur before the beginning of December.","Alex Vrolijk (95%): With the war in Gaza having<br />no end in sight still and Israel's new offensive<br />in Lebanon, I do not see why Netanyahu would<br />be replaced by December 1st. Even with public<br />pressure, I do not expect Netanyahu or Israel's<br />offensive to see any significant change. I believe<br />the only way Netanyahu is not PM by December 1st<br />is if he were assassinated/killed.","John Mathis (75%): There has been no sign that<br />Netanyahu is even thinking about stepping down<br />now, and has said quite the opposite. There has<br />been calls for him to step down for months from<br />all sides, but I still do not think it is enough.<br />Similarly, 70% of Israelis want an early election,<br />but there has been no indication of Netanyahu<br />caving to these demands.","Haley Ford (84%): The political situation in<br />Israel is unpredictable - with the 2018-2022<br />Israel Political crisis as evidence of early<br />elections and political turnovers. However, the<br />next election isn't scheduled until 2026, and even<br />if an election is called early, there will have<br />to be an announcement period, campaign period,<br />voting, etc. which would likely take 3-4 months<br />in of itself. Given that is nearing October, if<br />it did occur in early October, at the earliest<br />it would time out to be early December--at the<br />earliest, which would likely not be exactly<br />December 1st. Other factors include the ongoing<br />Gaza war, which there is opposition against<br />Netanyahu, but would be more likely to result in<br />election until the war is over.","Edward Tsui (95%): Israel's general election<br />for the Knesset is in October of 2026. Despite<br />Ben Netanyahu's striking polarity in approval,<br />Israel would probably not oust their current Prime<br />Minister for war crimes unless a special election<br />is determined upon impeachment, and the war in<br />Gaza were to come to a ceasefire. The likelihood<br />of an impeachment is lower since January of 2024<br />since Ben implemented newer legislation that would<br />make it harder to oust a Prime Minister aside from<br />health and mental reasons. Furthermore, the war in<br />Gaza is unlikely to come to an end before December<br />1st regardless of who is elected in the US General<br />election come November 5th.","Findleigh Ague (80%): Benjamin Netanyahu assumed<br />office in 2022, meaning that his four-year term<br />is not over until 2026. That being said, Netanyahu<br />has been met with a lot of backlash and opposition<br />and has been urged by many to hold an election<br />because many believe that he would not win<br />reelection. Even though this is true, now we have<br />to consider if this election will actually happen<br />before December 1st this year. Benny Gantz, one<br />of the cabinet members of Israel, urged Netanyahu<br />to settle on a date for elections in September,<br />which is obviously not going to be happening.<br />Gantz knows that polls suggest his party would<br />come out on top and that he would be favored to<br />be the next prime minister, and Netanyahu knows<br />that it would be an unwise decision for himself to<br />hold a reelection when many believe that he would<br />not be reelected. He claims that an election right<br />now would just be giving into Hamas and would<br />paralyze Israel and their efforts to establish a<br />hostage deal. Based on his beliefs on the matter<br />and the fact that there is no required election<br />until 2026, I don't think that it is extremely<br />likely for there to be an election before December<br />1st. However, if there is, I think that there is a<br />pretty good chance that he will not be reelected","Sara Whitmire (87%): Israel's next election is in<br />2026, so there's no chance of him being officially<br />voted out by Israeli citizens. Israel is currently<br />in the midst of multiple international conflicts,<br />with Netanyahu at the helm, and a change in<br />leadership is not the state's first priority and<br />would not be conducive to success in these foreign<br />conflicts. Internationally and locally, there is<br />criticism of Netanyahu's policy, but there's not<br />a big chance of him resigning or being impeached.<br />I won't exactly rule out assassination, given how<br />2024 is going, and there has been at least one<br />assassination in Israeli history.","Franco Bravo (80%): Like I mentioned in my paper,<br />I believe that Netenyahu will still be in power<br />by December 1st. With support from his party still<br />there, and also support from the US still being<br />there aswell, I dont believe that he steps down<br />anytime soon. Furthermore, Netenyahu seems like an<br />individual that will not give up and does not step<br />down even with massive amounts of pressure."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.68999999999999995],"y":[3.0364433410577476],"text":"Crowd

Crowe (47%): I give a 47% chance that the<br />democratic party will win a majority of seats in<br />November. I predict below a coin toss because of<br />the majority that the republican party holds now,<br />and the amount of toss up seats projected for<br />this election. While it is completely possible for<br />the democratic party to win a majority, they have<br />several obstacles to doing so.","Ryan Foley (60%): Currently, Democrats and<br />Republicans hold 212 and 220 seats in the House<br />respectively. There are 24 toss-up elections<br />in the House and with the presidency looking<br />increasingly like it will go blue, it seems<br />like the House could follow suit. With the<br />recent funding issues in the House, I feel like<br />Republicans may be negatively stigmatized. This<br />on top of recent controversies that keep appearing<br />within the Republican party, it may become harder<br />for voters to connect with candidates in these<br />toss-up elections. Many of the Republican toss-ups<br />are found in Democratic states as well, leading me<br />to believe these could turn blue this election.","ladi fashogbon (51%): The Democratic Party is<br />projected to win between 205 and 236 seats, while<br />Republicans are predicted to hold 199 seats, with<br />many toss-up districts yet to be decided​( Solid<br />Purple )​( The Hill ). Thus, the probability of<br />Democrats winning a majority currently ranges from<br />about 49% to 51%, Given these details, i believe<br />they would have an ever slight edge based on the<br />amount of seats.","Hayden Morehouse (62%): I got this answer from<br />a forcasting account. I presume its a bit of a<br />tossup but I wanted to lean a certain way and my<br />research led me to leaning towards the democratic<br />party holding a majority of the seats.","Gracie Culpepper (57%): I went through the 22<br />districts that are labelled as toss-ups and did<br />my own research to determine how I think each<br />district will vote. I also think that Kamala<br />taking the ticket instead of Biden this election<br />will help democrats gain more seats in the HOR.<br />However, the numbers I came up with is 219-216<br />which is incredibly close, and I also have my own<br />biases that may have affected how I looked at each<br />particular district. For these reasons, I'm saying<br />57%.","Kira Liscombe (73%): Republicans currently hold<br />the house majority in the 118th Congress, which<br />is one of the narrowest margins in U.S. history.<br />According to PEW Reasearch Center, margins of<br />control of fewer than 5 percentage points have<br />prevailed in a third of the 15 most recent<br />Houses. YouGov's 2024 House model predicts a<br />Republican Majority in Senate and Democratic<br />Majority in the House with a median prediction<br />of Democrats winning with 219 seats (based on<br />a series of 3,000 simulations). This is backed<br />up by other forecasting platforms such as Race<br />to the Whitehouse which favors Democrats with a<br />63.2% Chance to win a majority, based on 20,000<br />simulations every update. I dont think a win is<br />set in stone for the Democratic party, but it<br />seems that they are definitley favored to grab a<br />House majority in the next election.","Erin Ho (58%): As of recent events, Ricardo Nunes,<br />the incumbent Mayor or Brazil, and Guilherme<br />Boulos, one of the top challengers, are currently<br />locked in a tie for the Sao Paulo mayoral race.<br />Nunes has the backing of former President Jair<br />Bolsonaro, a far-right conservative, while Boulos<br />has the backing of the current President Luiz<br />Inacio Lula da Silva. Things are close between the<br />two candidates, due to Boulos having progressive<br />voters' support and Nunes having conservative<br />supporters. A recent poll shows that Nunes has a<br />mere 1% head on Boulos, which means this election<br />could go either way in the coming week, perhaps<br />even going into a runoff.","Erin Ho (46%): There is a small gap between the<br />Democrats and the Republicans in the House, which<br />can change either way depending on what happens<br />in the next few weeks. Right now, it comes down<br />to a few things like how the economy looks, what<br />policies they support or want to implement, and<br />perhaps incumbents' possible open seats with House<br />politicians stepping down.","Ryan Foley (35%): The Sao Paulo election is<br />plagued with controversy this year as physical<br />brawls have broken out between candidates during<br />debates. Nunes, the current leader in the most<br />recent polling, looks set to win re-election<br />as mayor as Marcal, the cause of many of the<br />fights, follows about 5 points behind. Marcal<br />has been seen the most media attention because<br />of his actions, but still cannot garner the votes<br />to defeat Nunes. Having a widely known criminal<br />record, Marcal struggles to connect with voters.<br />With Nunes having incumbency advantage as well, I<br />see him holding onto his position as mayor.","Liv Payne (62%): It seems that this is going to<br />be a rather close race. Currently, Republicans<br />have a majority with 222 seats (218 needed for<br />majority), but this current race is expected to<br />have less than a 5 seat difference. One source<br />I found (https://www.racetothewh.com/house ,<br />I highly recommend it, it has some fascinating<br />data and predictions) said that Democrats have<br />a 63.3% chance, showing that, in recent months,<br />Republicans have rapidly lost the public's favor.<br />Another source, Split-Ticket.org gives Democrats<br />a 58% chance of winning the majority. I chose 62%<br />because it feels like the race is extremely close,<br />and I trust the simulations run by Race to the WH,<br />since they have a high accuracy rating.","Colin Barry (60%): I think that the democrats have<br />a more than likely chance of winning the house in<br />November in a very tight race with Republicans. I<br />think this because of the many toss up districts<br />I think there is a slight edge in favor of the<br />Democratic Party. I do think the race is very<br />close, however, and that's why I only give a 60%<br />of them winning.","Colin Barry (40%): I think that it is unlikely<br />that there will be a new mayor in Sao Paulo, as<br />in recent weeks the incumbent candidate, Nunes,<br />has began to surge in recent weeks. I expect this<br />trend to continue as Nunes has the most free air<br />time allocate to him by the state based on how<br />many sets the party has in their congress.","Victor Avila (58%): Right now, the house is<br />composed of 220 Republicans and 212 Democrats with<br />3 vacant spots due to 2 deaths and 1 resignation<br />(1 Republican, 2 Democrats), with all 435 up for<br />grabs in November. At least 203 of these seats are<br />favored to lean Democrat, 211 seats are favored<br />to lean republican, and 25 are complete toss ups<br />according to the Cook political report. 12 of<br />the 25 that are toss ups are currently republican<br />held, while 10 are held by democrats (other 3 are<br />vacancies). While 7/12 republican held toss up<br />seats polls have democrat opponents ahead, so I<br />think democrats will hold the majority of seats<br />after the 2024 house elections.","Simon Gersten (60%): Based off of current<br />data, Democrats hold a slight lead in many of<br />the elections, but the polling remains within<br />the margin of error. It is likely to early to<br />accurately forecast this, but given current<br />trends, and assuming polling is relatively<br />accurate, which it has not always been, but it is<br />the only available data, Democrats are likely to<br />win a majority.","David Daniels (34%): Ricardo Nunes is currently<br />leading in almost every poll I've seen, with a<br />significant margin. Considering the historical<br />tendency for incumbent re-elections, it seems<br />unlikely that a new mayor will be elected in São<br />Paulo. Based on the numbers I've seen, Ricardo<br />Nunes is polling nearly 2-3% above the second<br />closest candidate, Guilherme Boulos. Taking these<br />projections and historical trends into account, I<br />estimate a 34% probability of São Paulo electing a<br />new major.","Simon Gersten (35%): I wrote a memo for this<br />question.","David Daniels (44%): According to current poll<br />projections, the GOP is in a favorable position in<br />both the House and the Senate. The outcome of the<br />elections is uncertain and could go either way,<br />like a coin flip. As of now, I believe it's more<br />likely that the GOP will take the House instead of<br />the Democrats, so I estimate a 44% probability of<br />the Democrats taking the House.","Brooke McDermott (35%): Most of the sources I<br />reviewed varied the toss-up seats between 11-24.<br />Majority of them were calling a Republican<br />majority in seats, some saying there would be a<br />Democratic by a very small margin.","Abby Crowe (40%): With my very limited<br />understanding of Brazil’s politics, I predict a<br />40% chance that there is a new Mayor after this<br />year’s municipal elections. There is projected<br />to be a runoff between the top two parties after<br />the regular election, and to my understanding-<br />the split vote on the 3rd party will favor the<br />incumbent in a runoff and therefore Nunes will<br />remain the mayor.","Corinne O'Dell (40%): The race for control<br />of the U.S. House of Representatives remains<br />highly competitive. Current projections suggest<br />that the Republicans have a slight edge, with<br />a 54% chance of retaining control of the House.<br />Republicans currently hold a narrow majority, and<br />the Democrats would need to flip just five seats<br />to regain control. However, with numerous key<br />races categorized as toss-ups, the outcome remains<br />uncertain.","Corinne O'Dell (53%): Incumbent mayor Ricardo<br />Nunes, who took office after the passing of Bruno<br />Covas, is polling at around 20-25%. Guilherme<br />Boulos, a left-leaning candidate from the<br />Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), leading with<br />around 28-30% support. Boulos has a strong base<br />among young, working-class voters, focusing on<br />issues like affordable housing and social justice.<br />The outcome is still uncertain, but Boulos<br />currently holds the edge.","Minha Ahmad (42%): I would say that it is unlikely<br />that there will be a new mayor in Sao Paulo<br />after the election. Recently, there was a very<br />publicized incident in which two of the candidates<br />got into a fight in which one threw a chair at<br />the other. Needless to say, it is highly unlikely<br />either of those candidates will win. The previous<br />mayor, Ricardo Nunes, is running for reelection. I<br />think it is possible that he will win, especially<br />since his other candidates are not necessarily<br />great prospects.","Minha Ahmad (45%): Currently, the Republicans<br />hold the majority of seats in the House of<br />Representatives. According to Newsweek, polls<br />show that voters are closely divided ahead of this<br />year's elections, which means that both parties<br />have a chance of winning a majority. I can not<br />confidently say that the Democrats will win a<br />majority, however at the same time, can not fully<br />rule out this possibility.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (38%): Currently, there<br />is a Republican majority in the House. Both The<br />Hill and the Wall Street Journal predict GOP<br />winning the House. The GOP party also has more<br />\"secured\" safe seats than the Democratic Party.<br />However, \"Race to the White House\" is the only<br />forecast website I could find that predicts an<br />entire different outcome. They have the Democratic<br />Party gaining control of the House at 65%. I<br />looked at the presidential elections from 2000 to<br />2020 and observed that if a Democratic candidate<br />wins presidency, it is likely for the House to be<br />the same.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (65%): Guilherme Boulos<br />leads most polls with a recent one showing a<br />three-way tie with the Ricardo Nunes (incumbent)<br />and Pablo Marcal (crazy chair-throwing candidate).<br />Boulos has the support of the current president,<br />who is supported by 48% of Brazilians (according<br />to Pew Research). In the Sixth Republic, only<br />two mayors have been re-elected. For this reason,<br />I believe that a new mayor will be elected, and<br />that would be Boulos, who is more outspoken about<br />social justice issues that resonate more with Sao<br />Paulo.","Vikram Bharadwaj (30%): Okay so there are a total<br />of 24 tossup seats, with democrats needing 15 and<br />republicans needing 10 in order to reach 218. If<br />we do the calculations of 2^24 (literally flipping<br />a coin 24 times) and set k=10, we see that out<br />of the 16.8 million universes, republicans win in<br />84.63% of them, with Dems winning in 15.37%. Now<br />while I would love to fully send on the 15% based<br />purely on the math, it is important to consider<br />the realistic scenario's in which Democrats could<br />potentially win as they historically have greater<br />turnout during general elections, winning the<br />house back in 2020. However I feel like 2024,<br />has turned somewhat back to business as usual,<br />meaning that there is a greater chance that people<br />will just look for change, leading to republicans<br />keeping the house by a slim majority.","Vikram Bharadwaj (30%): A major factor in this<br />is the incumbent advantage along with positive<br />polling numbers for the incumbent. With both of<br />these combined there is a great shot for Nunes to<br />win his election. On top of this, with a greater<br />shift towards the right within Brazil, more power<br />is being gained by Nunes' party, along with the<br />fact that the current far-right candidate has lost<br />a lot of support meaning that that support will<br />likely go to Nunes, giving him an even greater<br />advantage to win this election.","Alexis Frazer (25%): Redistricting after the<br />2020 census has led to more Republican-leaning<br />districts, and the historical trend of the party<br />in power losing seats in midterm elections adds<br />to their difficulties. Republicans currently<br />house more seats, and incumbents are consistently<br />favored in elections. I also believe a lot of<br />moderate repubicans who may vote for Kamala will<br />vote to fill the house and senate with republican<br />candidates.","Alexis Frazer (32%): Both candidates do not seem<br />particulary well liked by the general public,<br />they trade insults with one another, spread<br />lies, and do not behave in a proper political<br />manner. However, Marçal, although he shows slight<br />favoritism in the polls, recieves more public<br />backlash, as he often hates publicly on current<br />'woke' culture. The current mayor, is also<br />generally disliked, however tolerated, by the<br />people.","Jeffrey Markowitz (63.3%): Probability given by<br />racetothewh.com","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): Nunes still remains at<br />teh top of the polls, even though the margin is<br />close.","Reece Slater (53%): I think this one is almost<br />impossible to tell and virtually a coin flip.<br />While Republicans have more seats on lock, I<br />think Democrats have a razor thin edge in terms of<br />flipping seats. Every model I have looked at has<br />something different, but I will give Democrats the<br />slight edge.","Reece Slater (32%): I think that the incumbent,<br />Nunes, will remain mayor. He has a slight lead<br />in the polls among the pool of candidates, around<br />1-4%, but when polled head to head with the two<br />other leading candidates, he smokes them by around<br />15 points. It is possible that a new mayor is<br />sworn in as there are a number of candidates, I<br />think Nunes will still remain mayor. Also, the<br />incumbent advantage is in play which gives him a<br />natural boost.","John Mathis (56%): Overall, I think I will give<br />Democrats a 56% chance of taking back the House of<br />representatives. There are a ton of seats that are<br />a toss-up, so I personally think there is a lot<br />of room for variation and I cannot with certainty<br />say that one side is even likely to win the house.<br />House Races are also notoriously under-polled, and<br />the ones that do poll can be very inaccurate or<br />biased. The reason I give this one to democrats is<br />because the models tend to show a Dem flip to be<br />slightly more likely, with the models that show a<br />Republican House having it be by an even smaller<br />majority than in 2022.","Rommy Etzion (43%): Polling varies greatly<br />regarding if the Democrats or Republicans are<br />to win a majority of the seats in the house,<br />and whichever one wins will likely hold a slim<br />majority. There has been some redistricting,<br />many favoring the Democrats but some giving<br />the Republicans a slight edge and potentially<br />flipping Democratic-held seats. Kamala Harris’<br />approval ratings are growing following the recent<br />presidential debate, which often has an influence<br />on the house election, but the manner of this<br />election is not a solid indicator. Currently, the<br />Democrats are raising election funds in national<br />committees and super PACs. A difficult aspect<br />to consider is the hot-topics. While the House<br />is more focused on local issues, I project that<br />many will be voting on the current hot-topics,<br />which are the ongoing regional wars, abortion for<br />Democrats, and immigration for Republicans. While<br />democratic voters seem divided on the Israel-Hamas<br />War, they are united against restrictibe abortion<br />laws. It will be very close.","Rommy Etzion (40%): Based on recent polls that<br />have not fluctuate much since the release of the<br />first numbers and the start of the debates, Nunes<br />and Boulos are leading the race with between<br />24-27%. Marcal is not far behind with around<br />21%, but the municipal elections require more<br />than 50% of the votes to win. If a candidate<br />fails to receive a majority, then the election<br />goes to a runoff on October 27th. It is likely<br />for the elections to continue in the runoffs,<br />and then the two leading parties remain on the<br />ballet. Regardless of whether the runoff includes<br />Boulos or Marcel, it is likely that Marcal is a<br />candidate. Then, the election will be very close.<br />I expect it to lean for Boulos because Marcel’s<br />right-leaning voters may change their vote to<br />Nunes, and the majority of San Paulo voters<br />identify as right-wing. That being said it will<br />be a close election and I am not confident to who<br />will win.","Edward Tsui (35%): This year, about 90% of<br />House seats are deemed uncompetitive. This is a<br />continuing reality in the House: In 2022, 84% of<br />House seats were either decided by margins of 10<br />points or more or went uncontested entirely. The<br />average margin of victory in the contested races<br />was 28 points. Only 36 races in 2022 were decided<br />by less than 5 points.Currently, the chamber<br />has 219 Republicans, 213 Democrats and three<br />vacancies, two of which were held by Republicans<br />and one by a Democrat. This means that, at full<br />maximization, the House balance would likely be<br />221-214. However, 11 seats are deemed toss-ups,<br />and numerous others are leaning towards either<br />party. Right now, it's 207 to 207 with 21 in<br />the air. I believe republicans have a slight<br />advantage.","Edward Tsui (43.5%): In São Paulo, Richard Nunes<br />is the incumbent. All ten rival candidates are<br />white, and only two are women. Mixed results in<br />polls. According to the Brazilian Report, roughly<br />29% of voters lean towards the left-leaning<br />workers party in comparison to 17% of the<br />Bolsonarism incumbent. However, in contrast,<br />26% of voters say they lean right in comparison<br />to the 20% that say they lean left. I believe<br />the incumbent has an advantage in this upcoming<br />election , but not by much. In reality, I would<br />call this election a toss-up before Sunday. As of<br />24 hours ago, Nunes has a 2% lead over Boulos. I<br />lowered my probability from 50-50 by 6.5% because<br />of Nunes advantage.","Jessica Armour (45%): based on my research, the<br />Republicans seem to have an advantage in the house<br />more so than the democratic party therefore, I<br />think it is less likely that the Democratic Party<br />will win a majority of seats","Abigail Harris (30%): All of the swing seats<br />in this election cycle for the House of<br />Representatives are currently blue. The incumbent<br />party is typically not favored in a swing seat<br />or an unsafe seat. There's all the question of it<br />being a presidential election year and more people<br />coming out to vote than usual.","Abigail Harris (30%): There have been repeated<br />instances of violence surrounding the elections.<br />From a thrown chair to a near clubbing it's an<br />interesting case. Marcal is dominating headlines<br />with the brash and violence but he's not a favored<br />candidate for mayor, instead a legislative seat<br />in 2026 because he's more popular with his base<br />than the larger population due in part to the<br />outlandish headlines he creates.","Jessica Armour (30%): the current major has been<br />reelected numerous times and is currently on his<br />third term. with that being said, i see it being<br />highly unlikely that a new mayor will replace his<br />considering how favored he is.","Shayna Van Glish (40%): Boulos currently appears<br />to have a higher probability of winning if his<br />momentum continues. However, incumbents like<br />Nunes tend to have a strong final push due to<br />established networks, resources, and visibility.<br />Therefore, the race is competitive, and while<br />Boulos is leading, the probability of Nunes<br />maintaining his position remains significant. This<br />is why I am giving it a 40% chance that there is a<br />new mayor after the elections.","Shayna Van Glish (55%): Democrats have a slight<br />edge, with about a 51% chance of winning a<br />majority, while Republicans have around a 49%<br />chance of retaining control. Currently, Democrats<br />are projected to win between 205 and 235 seats,<br />but there are many toss-up races that could swing<br />the final outcome either way​. That is why I am<br />putting my probability at a little higher than the<br />projected 51%.","Haley Ford (22%): -Incumbant advantage, party<br />popularity, pattern of incumbent reelection wins","Matthew Harvey (40%): This will probably be one<br />of my closest probabilities towards the middle.<br />This is due to the shear \"toss up\" regarding<br />the seats that are up for grabs right now in<br />the house. 47 seats are competitive and in those<br />competitive seats 24 dems are playing defense and<br />23 republicans are on defense. However these are<br />highly competitive and any slip-ups can change the<br />course of a campaign. Not to mention, republicans<br />already have a majority.","Leo Zegarra (50%): The truth is that it is quite<br />hard to predict which party will control more<br />seats between the two powerhouse parties. With the<br />Democrats facing challenges in swing districts and<br />Republicans benefiting from redistricting in some<br />states, it’s a close race. Polls and past trends<br />suggest the Democrats have a 45-50% chance of<br />regaining a majority. Factors like voter turnout<br />and economic conditions will play a crucial role.","Matthew Harvey (30%): The Sao Paulo mayoral<br />election is definitley an odd and strange one.<br />There are 4 strong candidates (including the<br />incumbent) who are vying for a strong majority.<br />However the incumbent is winning in recent polls<br />and those that are worried about the craziness of<br />the new candidates are likely to vote for what we<br />know.","Alex Vrolijk (45%): The democrats currently do not<br />hold the house and flipping seats is difficult.<br />A ~4+ seat gain would be needed for democrats<br />to gain control of the house. Projections have<br />also shown that republicans have a lead over the<br />democrats in odds to win the house this upcoming<br />November.","Haley Ford (61%): This is a a razor thin race,<br />with last election cycle showing how deeply<br />divided. However, it seems like the Democratic<br />Party is slightly more favored to flip the house.<br />(possibly senate goes to Red)","Findleigh Ague (70%): Whichever party receives<br />the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives,<br />they aren’t going to win by a huge margin. In<br />order for Democrats to win, they need a net gain<br />of four seats. This isn’t a huge task in order<br />to get rid of a weakly held Republican majority.<br />There are 22 races that are largely considered<br />to be toss-ups or swing districts, and 14 of them<br />are referred to as Democrat-leaning. Something to<br />consider as well is that undecided voters tend to<br />vote for change, meaning that many will probably<br />vote for the Democratic representatives for their<br />districts for a change in who has the majority.","Alex Vrolijk (75%): This is because Buous<br />is leading the current polls. Also, since no<br />candidate will reach 50% + 1 of the vote share it<br />will go into a runoff where Amaral's supporters<br />will move to support Buous. A combination of these<br />2 candidates nears 50% so I think Buos will beat<br />out the incumbent.","Findleigh Ague (70%): With a new front-running<br />candidate emerging, Pablo Marçal, and splitting<br />the right-wing votes, it looks as though Ricardo<br />Nunes might not be as close to a runoff after the<br />election as was initially thought. Marçal has a<br />lot of online traction and has really pushed his<br />campaigning, gaining the attention of right-wing<br />voters, so much so that in a recent poll, he had<br />received less votes than Guilherme Boulos, the<br />left-wing candidate, but more than Nunes, which<br />indicated for the first time that Nunes might<br />not even make it to the run off. With splitting<br />the right-wing votes, I think that it’s pretty<br />possible that Nunes does not get reelected for<br />mayor.","William Willis (40%): I gave the probability of 40<br />because I feel that the Democratic Party has been<br />loosing steam over the past couple of weeks. There<br />are some pivotal swing states and I feel like a<br />lot of these historically blue states, leaders<br />in the States are really anti democrat. With the<br />latest indictment of the NYC mayor it makes me<br />think that momentum is slowing for the party and<br />they will not make it happen.","William Willis (15%): I have the probability that<br />there will be a 15% probability of a new mayor.<br />The reason that I came up with this number is<br />because recent polling came out and Ricardo Nunes,<br />remains in the lead with 27% a few days before<br />the vote. It gives me confidence that he will be<br />selected because he took the place of the former<br />mayor and has done a good job for Brazil.","Joe Ornstein (33%): Depending on the approach<br />taken, one can get a *wide* range of predictions<br />for this question. Based on the generic ballot,<br />Democrats are up +1.8 points nationally, which<br />corresponds to an expected seat share of roughly<br />210 and a 22% chance of winning the House.<br />District-level projections from outlets like<br />Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball<br />suggest that Democrats have 190 solid/likely seats<br />compared to 201 Republican solid/likely seats, a<br />very large deficit (something like a 7-8% chance<br />of winning all the necessary toss-up seats).<br />Prediction markets like Metaculus and Polymarket<br />are more bullish (45% and 63% respectively), but<br />these are not the sort of liquid markets we've<br />seen in past elections (Americans need Bitcoin<br />and a VPN to bet in Polymarket), so I take these<br />estimates with a grain of salt. YouGov's MRP model<br />gives Democrats a 57% chance, but this model's<br />track record is untested (they published an MRP<br />House model once in 2018 and the result was barely<br />within the 95% confidence interval). Aggregating<br />these forecasts, I land on 33%.","Joe Ornstein (15%): There have been nearly two<br />dozen polls fielded on this municipal race in<br />the past month, and the general consensus is<br />that the incumbent mayor Ricardo Nunes will make<br />it to the top-two runoff, and, conditional on<br />making it to the runoff, will crush any opponent<br />by double-digit margins. Going back to 2008,<br />these head-to-head second round polls seem to be<br />reliable predictors of who will win.","Kira Liscombe (5%): U.S. unemployment has been<br />on a slow rise this year, growing from 3.7% in<br />January to a last reported 4.2% in August. The<br />last time unemployment in the US reached above 5%<br />was in August of 2021. According to the U.S. Bureu<br />of Labor Statistics, states with statistically<br />significant unemployment rate changes from July<br />2024 to August 2024 only saw as high as a 0.4%<br />change, which occurred in South Carolina. Overall,<br />there were only 4 states with unemployment rates<br />significantly different from that of the U.S.<br />that fell over 5%. Even though we have seen a<br />climb in unemployment this year, the rate remains<br />relatively low by historical standards and it is<br />very unlikely to see rapid enough growth over the<br />next two months so that it reaches above 5%.","Erin Ho (15%): Looking at this year’s unemployment<br />rate, the highest the unemployment rate reached<br />was 4.3% and based on other predictions online,<br />will remain on the lower side for the rest of<br />the year. Things that currently influence the<br />unemployment rate is temporary layoffs (different<br />from permanent layoffs) and new labor force<br />entrants. Temporary layoffs allow companies to cut<br />costs without permanently losing their employees,<br />and labor force entrants are people entering the<br />labor force for the first time, so this could be<br />teenagers or freshly graduated college students.","Ryan Foley (40%): The Bureau of Labor Statistics<br />released August's unemployment rate with it<br />sitting at 4.2%. This is a slight bump from<br />this time last year when the unemployment rate<br />was at 3.8%. Google's statistics show that we<br />are on a very slight rise in unemployment since<br />2022, however the last time we were at over 5%<br />unemployment was August 2021. This was when the<br />US was still returning from the COVID-19 pandemic<br />and many Americans were returning to work. With<br />the recent rate cut, unemployment could tick<br />up slightly but I doubt it will hit 5%. With<br />the election coming up as well, unless Kamala<br />introduces drastic changes to the economy there<br />shouldn't be too huge of changes to unemployment<br />rates.","Victor Avila (15%): I think there is a 15%<br />probability that the US unemployment rate will<br />rise above 5% by December 1st. Just recently,<br />the United States unemployment rate fell to 4.2%<br />from 4.3% in September according to the bureau<br />of labor statistics, which was below economists’<br />expectations due to adding 142,000 jobs in August.<br />So this recent fall in unemployment mixed with the<br />recent ½ percent rate cut by the Fed (which will<br />lead to more investment and hiring) gives a slim<br />chance to the unemployment rate rising above 5% by<br />December.","Simon Gersten (24%): According to the federal<br />reserve, the U.S. is likely to remain well below<br />the 5% threshold. The current estimation is that<br />it will remain below 4.5%. Given that there are<br />no foreseeable collapses of the economy yet,<br />unemployment is likely to remain below 5%. This<br />could change, however, with rising tensions in the<br />Middle East and strikes in ports along the east<br />coast.","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): The unemployment rate<br />has changed little in the past few months, however<br />strikes from dock workers threaten the economy.","Haley Ford (10%): Although a rising unemployment<br />rate is likely, above 5% indicates rapid change.<br />Right now economists are noticing a \"softening\"<br />of the economy - but indicate it doesn't represent<br />a recession. Additionally, the interest rate<br />cuts from the Fed could help prevent further<br />unemployment, although it will take time to see<br />the effects of the reduction.","Abby Crowe (3%): I give a 3% chance that the<br />unemployment rate will raise above 5%. From what<br />I can tell, the job market has been relatively<br />stable, only fluctuating about a tenth or so<br />from the current rate (4.2%) for the past couple<br />of years. Long term predictions only predict<br />minor movement. Additionally, the Fed cutting<br />interest rates should theoretically help to reduce<br />unemployment, and that will begin to show in the<br />next couple of months.","David Daniels (12%): The likelihood of the<br />unemployment rate surging above 5% is highly<br />improbable. Currently, the unemployment rate<br />is at 4.2%, and it is not projected to increase<br />significantly, especially in such a short time<br />span such as December. My reasoning for this<br />probability is also supported by the Federal<br />Reserve cutting rates. These reasons consider I<br />assign a 12% probability.","Brooke McDermott (25%): I don't see the<br />unemployment rate rising above 5%. I saw that<br />there have been less unemployment insurance claims<br />since the beginning of this year, and they are<br />steadily decreasing. However, CNN reported that<br />unemployment generally tends to increase by a<br />percentage point by the following year.","Shayna Van Glish (15%): As of August 2024, the<br />U.S. unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, reflecting<br />a modest increase from previous months. While<br />job growth has slowed, particularly in sectors<br />like healthcare and construction, forecasts<br />from financial analysts and institutions such<br />as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan suggest that the<br />unemployment rate may edge slightly higher in the<br />coming months. However, it is not expected to rise<br />above 5% before December 2024, barring any major<br />economic disruptions.","Alexis Frazer (15%): As of August, the<br />unemployment rate was a 4.2 and based off of<br />trends over the past 2 years, rates do not tend<br />to fluctuate by .8 in a span of two months. There<br />are many outside effects that could impact the<br />unemployment rate, and immigration is believed to<br />be the driving factor of the currently increasing<br />unemployment rate, but the probability for it to<br />surge in the next two months is improbable.","Corinne O'Dell (18%): It is unlikely that the<br />U.S. unemployment rate will rise above 5% before<br />December 1, 2024. Current forecasts suggest the<br />rate will reach around 4.7% by the end of the<br />year, reflecting gradual job market softening. The<br />Federal Reserve and other projections anticipate<br />that while the labor market may continue to<br />weaken, the unemployment rate is not expected to<br />exceed 5% in the near term unless a significant<br />economic disruption occurs.","Ladi Fashogbon (28%): n August 2024 was around<br />3.8%, slightly higher than its historic lows<br />earlier in the year. A gradual rise has been<br />observed, but the rate is still well below 5. What<br />i researched led me to believe that the rate would<br />be less than 30 for this being otherwise, but not<br />as low as 25.","Vikram Bharadwaj (15%): Currently with<br />unemployment rate at what its at, it is extremely<br />improbable that we would reach such a high<br />unemployment rate so soon. Currently with a 4.2%<br />at August, it would be historic for it to rise<br />.8 in just 3 total months, as even a .2 increase<br />in one month would be insanely high. Looking at<br />projection by investment firms such as vanguard,<br />they project it to \"marginally (be) above current<br />levels,\" and I'm guessing that a multi-billion<br />dollar investment management group would have some<br />sort of a good read at this. On top of that, with<br />the current rate cuts, would generally indicate<br />that unemployment should decrease if anything, as<br />long as the market stays roughly the same (please<br />no wwIII I beg of the.)","Colin Barry (10%): The US unemployment rate is<br />currently 4.2%, and recently held its longest<br />streak of being under 4% since the Vietnam War.<br />This indicates that it is unlikely for such<br />a drastic turn to cause the unemployment rate<br />to rise so drastically. The unemployment rate<br />forecasted to remain in the range of 3.7% and the<br />current 4.2% for the next couple of years until<br />2027. For this reason I think there is a 10%<br />chance it increases above 5%.","Minha Ahmad (20%): Currently the U.S. unemployment<br />rate is 4.3% and it is not expected to change by<br />December. According to the Washington Post, the<br />unemployment rate reached to 4.3% in August of<br />this year, and was at 3.4% in April 2023. Although<br />this is a big jump, this increase of point nine<br />percent occurred in a year and three months time.<br />Another jump of point seven percent in three<br />months time until December is highly unlikely.","Hayden Morehouse (20%): See Briefing","Liv Payne (15%): It seems pretty unlikely that<br />employment is going to rise from 4.2% (the current<br />rate) to 5% in two months (a 0.8% increase when<br />the current trend is about 0.1% a month, with<br />some 0.1% decrease). Even though unemployment has<br />been gradually increasing, the 0.8% increase is<br />too high of a jump without some factor beyond the<br />usual patterns (such as temporary unemployment).<br />Economics are also saying that we are not seeing<br />the indications of a recession *beyond* this<br />unemployment increase (see Sahm Rule), therefore a<br />recession is unlikely.","Rommy Etzion (20%): The unemployment rate has been<br />recently stable between 4.1-4.3% in recent months<br />and has been consistently below 5% not including<br />the COVID spike. The rate has been on a downward<br />slope (not including the pandemic), and there<br />are no currently foreseeable factors indicating<br />a major change in the trajectory. The GDP growth<br />rate has been exceeding 2.5% for the past year and<br />inflation has been decreasing alongside relatively<br />low unemployment. Consumer unit expenditures have<br />been increasing, and personal consumption has<br />also been increasing slightly. And an increase of<br />0.8% in 2 months is a significant jump in a short<br />period of time.","John Mathis (8%): For Unemployment to reach 5% by<br />December, there would have to be a .8% increase<br />over 2 months. This has happened before, but only<br />in the midst of severe recession, which we are not<br />currently in. So unless there is an unprecedented<br />pandemic or housing crash within the next<br />month-ish (labor statistics have about a month of<br />delay to publish), we will not see unemployment<br />rate above 5% on dec. 1","Matthew Harvey (15%): In this short amount of<br />time. I don't believe that the unemployment rate<br />will rise above the 5% given in the probability<br />question. This is due to a couple of factors. For<br />one, unemployment rate right now is at 4.2%. Two,<br />the fed cutting rates will help with the rate. We<br />haven't seen the impact of that yet.","Jessica armour (36%): Based on statistics posted<br />within Trading Economics and Statistica, the<br />unemployment rate has spiked since March of 2024,<br />and is currently at 4.2% as of August 2024. With<br />that being said, unemployment rate is expected to<br />rise to at least 4.6% due to financial constraints<br />and increased interest rates. Along with this,<br />it is important to consider that financial<br />constraints get significantly more intense at the<br />end of the year due to the holidays, which is a<br />time of year in which layoffs are significantly<br />common. However, as of right now, I would say it<br />is probably unlikely that unemployment rate will<br />be more than 5% by the end of the year due to the<br />downward trend we are currently experiencing.","Alex Vrolijk (15%): August 2024 unemployment rate<br />is 4.2% and has been growing steadily. Despite the<br />current growth I do not expect it to surpass 5%<br />by December 1st. The Fed is also lowering interest<br />rates which should also help reduce unemployment.<br />Unless any major unexpected events occur, I do not<br />believe unemployment will rise above 5%.","Findleigh Ague (10%): Though the unemployment<br />rate right now isn’t insanely far from 5%, and it<br />had increased since 2023, I think that it would<br />take something pretty drastic for it to ride all<br />the way to 5%. I’ve also seen multiple forecasts<br />predicting the rate to remain below 4.5% for the<br />next few years, so I don’t think that it will rise<br />before the end of this one.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (14%): Some economic<br />models predict that the unemployment rate will<br />increase to 4.5% next year. The job market is<br />currently strong. Sudden changes are not as<br />common. I also observed in graphs that in the past<br />5 years, the unemployment rate decreased around<br />Nov-Dec/stayed constant. Sudden changes occurred<br />more over the summer or after the beginning of<br />the year. With the cut of interest rates this past<br />month, I think that will further stimulate the<br />job market in the right direction (praying for my<br />brier score).","Leo Zegarra (16%): I gave this question a 16%<br />chance of happening. This is mainly due to the<br />current economic indicators, such as stable<br />consumer spending and solid job growth, which<br />are making a sharp rise in unemployment unlikely.<br />The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies, aiming<br />to balance inflation without derailing the job<br />market, also play a crucial role in limiting<br />the likelihood of a sudden spike, so I gave it<br />a relatively low chance for the couple of months<br />left in the timeline.","Carson Ankeny (40%): Unemployment is slowly rising<br />currently and is around 4%. There is a chance that<br />this slow rise will result in it going over 5%,<br />as well as a chance that it will stay just below<br />5%. However, due to the way these statistics are<br />gathered and the relatively late release of jobs<br />reports, there isn’t a lot of time for this to<br />happen.","Gracie Culpepper (19%): Although the unemployment<br />rate is rising and has been for the past few<br />months, it is currently only sitting at 4.3%.<br />That's a lot more people that would need to<br />become unemployed before the start of December.<br />Even with the hurricane and people possibly being<br />displaced/jobless due to the damage, I still think<br />jobs and work will be needed to repair surrounding<br />communities and will make up for the unemployment<br />deficit it may cause.","Reece Slater (0%): No chance it rises above 5%<br />by Dec 1. Almost every database or forecast I<br />have seen has the 2024 rate at around 3.7-4.5%.<br />I also found a forecast model that gave it around<br />a 4% chance for the unemployment rate to be from<br />4.9-5.4%. Right now it is around 4.2%, and I don't<br />see it rising to 5% in two months.","Edward Tsui (28%): Trading economics forecasts<br />December 2024 to have an unemployment rate of<br />4.4%. I do not think the unemployment rate will<br />sky rocket 0.8 in about two months. Furthermore,<br />the rate just recently went down since August<br />2024, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics has a<br />meeting on Friday to update the status. Other<br />sources like Statista predict anywhere from<br />4.4-4.7 % by December.","Joe Ornstein (3%): The recent Federal Reserve<br />interest rate cut reflects a general consensus<br />among economists that rising unemployment is now<br />a greater risk than inflation. Though a \"soft<br />landing\" is the most likely outcome, there is<br />a non-negligible risk that the economy enters a<br />recession by the end of 2024. If the East coast<br />dockworkers' strike continues for an extended<br />period, it could compound that risk. All that<br />said, historically a 0.8 percentage point rise in<br />the unemployment rate almost never occurs within<br />the span of two months, even at the onset of a<br />recession. (The COVID-19 pandemic is a notable<br />exception; one would only expect such a rapid<br />rise in unemployment if a catastrophe of a similar<br />magnitude occurred between now and December.)","Sara Whitmire (20%): According to the Bureau<br />of Labor Statistics, as of August 2024, the<br />unemployment rate is about 4.2%, and a year before<br />it was 3.8%; a sudden jump by .8 points to a 5%<br />rate between now and December seems unlikely. The<br />Fed interest rate adjustments in recent months<br />will likely have a positive impact on unemployment<br />rates.","Franco Bravo (20%): I believe that the<br />unemployment rate will remain under 5 percent. One<br />of the reasons I believe so is because ive read<br />that the overall prediction for the end of the<br />year is for it to be at 4.4 and unless something<br />drastic happens in the economy, I believe it will<br />remain lower than 5","Erin Ho (35%): The current state of the<br />Russia-Ukraine war is swaying quite a bit.<br />Recently, Russia was able to takeover Vuhledar<br />after two years of resistance, which is a huge<br />blow on Ukraine and Kyiv’s position in the war. It<br />shows some weakness in their military strength and<br />risk in trying to keep the Russian territory. With<br />the possibility of more Russian counterattacks<br />and Ukraine’s limited military capabilities, they<br />might not be able to hold onto it if they want to<br />protect their own land.","Kira Liscombe (77%): By 2024, Western intelligence<br />officials estimated that the Russo-Ukranian<br />war had set back Russia’s attempts at military<br />modernization by nearly two full decades. As of<br />August 2024, Ukrainians are taking and holding<br />Russian land, and Russians are pushing in the<br />east. Ukraine's foreign ministry says it is not<br />interested in \"taking territory\" in the region,<br />but will continue its offensive until Russia<br />agrees to \"a just peace\". Western intelligence<br />sources think it could be a question of who<br />withdraws their forces first. Additionally,<br />Ukrainian military analyst Mykhailo Samus assessed<br />that Moscow would need in the realm of 50,000<br />troops, to fully retake the areas Ukraine now<br />controls, and that’s not a force Russia seems<br />eager to commit. Last week, Ukraine presented<br />their \"victory plan\" to the US, but there was<br />not much eagerness in response. The answer to<br />this depends on aid, a possible NATO invitation,<br />and ceasefire negotiations, but with Mid Eastern<br />conflict and the US Elelection holding the<br />spotlight, i find it unlikely that Ukrainian<br />military forces will leave Russia before Dec 1.","Ryan Foley (60%): Ukraine has been making<br />important advances into Russian territory over<br />the past couple of weeks. With the war continuing<br />to creep on, Russia has suffered a far greater<br />proportion of losses compared to Ukraine and it<br />shows in their abilities to continue to fight.<br />Ukraine has also been using drones to strike<br />further into Russian territory, most notably<br />destroying an ammo depot inside of Russia. So long<br />as the US continues to supply Ukraine with the<br />equipment needed to maintain their position, I<br />don't see Ukraine backing out of Russia. However,<br />with Republican support for Ukraine dwindling,<br />they could easily fall behind and allow Russia to<br />retake land.","Joe Ornstein (80%): Despite Putin's stated orders<br />to repel Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast<br />by October 1, Ukraine still occupies the vast<br />majority of the territory it took during its<br />August offensive. The Ukrainian general staff took<br />a big risk ordering this attack, as it diverts<br />some of their best troops and equipment from the<br />defense of Donetsk. They are unlikely to order<br />a withdrawal in the near future, as they see<br />the Kursk offensive as an important victory for<br />morale, a way to divide the attention of Russia's<br />forces, and promote continued Western support.","Joe Ornstein (10%): IANAL, but I have read<br />through the lawsuit and the relevant sections<br />of the Election Code (Chapter 183-1-12) and<br />the case for striking down the newly-adopted<br />Hand Count Rule seems strong on the merits. The<br />change is last-minute (potentially violating<br />Purcell doctrine), contradicts several other<br />subsections of the Election Code pertaining to the<br />security and custody of paper ballots, and seems<br />inconsistent with statutes passed by the General<br />Assembly clarifying that ballots be tabulated at<br />the level of the election superintendent rather<br />than the precinct. The Georgia Attorney General<br />and Secretary of State (both Republicans) have<br />publicly stated that they believe the SEB's rule<br />oversteps its authority. The case is likely to be<br />heard and decided within two weeks.","Colin Barry (60%): The Ukranian troops that have<br />captured a piece of the Kursk region have done so<br />to attempt to relieve some of the pressure on the<br />eastern front. Russia has pressed on however, and<br />seem seemingly is in no rush to push them out. I<br />see this occupation as more of bargaining chip,<br />and with no peace talks in sight ahead of December<br />1st, I think it's more likely than not they are<br />still there.","Alex Vrolijk (70%): Zelenskyy has stated his<br />intention to establish a command office in<br />the Ukrainian-controlled territory of Sudzha.<br />Zelenskyy claims this will help defend eastern<br />Ukraine so I hope any Russian pressure will not<br />result in an immediate Ukrainian withdrawal. With<br />Russian pressure yet to challenge Ukranian troops<br />for the past 2 months, I am hopeful they won't<br />levy any serious pressure until after Dec. 1'st<br />as they still seem to be focusing on Ukraine's<br />southeastern front.","Colin Barry (60%): Georgia's State Election Board<br />has just approved a new rule that would require<br />this hand-counting of ballots. State officials and<br />members of the Democratic Party have been pushing<br />back on this, however, as this process would be<br />tedious and is hard to implement this close to<br />the election. A court hearing is scheduled for the<br />near future to weigh the lawfulness of the rule,<br />which is why I have the chance so low.","Alex Vrolijk (45%): Although Georgia hand counting<br />ballots is now technically a law that will remain<br />in effect for the election, Democrats have begun<br />a lawsuit that could overturn it. The Georgia<br />Elections Board Chairman also states how they<br />are not a legislative body and that a lawsuit<br />could easily shoot down hand counting ballots.<br />Despite the chairman's statements, I would not<br />be surprised if a court does not overturn the law<br />even with an incoming lawsuit.","Jessica armour (65%): The rule to hand-count polls<br />was already passed Sept 20. However, three days<br />ago a lawsuit was filed stating that this rule<br />was unproductive and unconstitutional. With that<br />being said, considering the rule is already been<br />passed it is up to the swiftness of the Court<br />to determine whether or not it actually happens.<br />Along with this, the Secretary of State even<br />mentions his distaste for hand-counting polls.<br />However, several other states have also made last<br />minute changes to their voting methods, so Georgia<br />isn't the only one radically changing something.<br />I would say that unless new information comes out<br />from the Court it is more likely to happen because<br />it has already been passed.","Simon Gersten (85%): The arrival of winter will<br />likely freeze territorial advances on both sides.<br />In addition, international support for Ukraine<br />remains high, which shows that Ukraine will likely<br />not be pushed back further in the foreseeable<br />future.","Jessica armour (75%): Ukrainian military forces<br />have been occupying parts of Russia since very<br />early August. With that being said, the Russian<br />military has been unsuccessful in removing them.<br />Along with this, although there has been some<br />Russian troops deployed there has still been<br />no give from the Ukrainian troops. Therefore,<br />more than likely they will remain in Russian<br />territories.","gracie culpepper (86%): Funding will be decided<br />after the inauguration of the next president. Most<br />plans have been announced to occur in 2025, and<br />I highly doubt there will be enough time left to<br />push them out completely.","gracie culpepper (62%): I think this election is<br />going to be very close, and with GA being a major<br />swing state, I think if this election is close by<br />any means one of the candidates will call for a<br />recount of the votes.","Hayden Morehouse (80%): The Ukrainian forces seem<br />to be stationed there for the time being with no<br />real intent on leaving currently. War moves slow<br />and even for them to fully evacuate the area would<br />take a large amount of time. I do worry about the<br />russian winter for the troops however so we will<br />see how that plays out.","Minha Ahmad (67%): I would say that the war<br />between Russia and Ukraine is not likely to end<br />by December and due to the fact that Ukraine has<br />consistent backing from major countries like the<br />United States, their forces will note exit Russia<br />by December 1st.","Hayden Morehouse (75%): I mainly put a high<br />percentage here because of all the commotion that<br />happened last year in regards to the voting count.<br />I also am thinking this will be a close election<br />with the swing states playing an important factor<br />and they will want to be precise.","Minha Ahmad (80%): Less than two weeks ago, the<br />Georgia election board voted to require ballots<br />to be hand counted in anticipation of the upcoming<br />election. I think that it is not likely so soon<br />to the election that this decision would be<br />overturned.","Vikram Bharadwaj (90%): There does not seem<br />to be any major reason for Ukraine to not<br />only relinquish control of their holdings in<br />Russia, or do anything other than just try and<br />weather the storm. Realistically, there will<br />not be a ceasefire, but I feel like there is a<br />significant enough chance that Russia launches<br />a counter-offensive that could push Ukraine out.<br />But given how Russia seems to have turned towards<br />a more bombardment aproach, I doubt any troop<br />movements would be made against the Ukrainian<br />holdings in Russia.","David Daniels (85%): With Russia recently<br />capturing Vuhledar, it seems unlikely that they<br />will leave Ukraine. Ukrainian forces won't give<br />up the little land they hold in Russia. Currently,<br />there appears to be a standstill on the Ukrainian<br />military side. I haven't heard any recent<br />news about Ukraine deciding to leave either.<br />Considering these reasons, I don't see Ukraine<br />leaving Russia anytime soon. Therefore, I assign<br />an 85% probability.","Alexis Frazer (65%): Ukraine's counteroffensives<br />have aimed to reclaim territory, and occasional<br />incursions into Russian border regions, such as<br />Belgorod, have been reported. These actions serve<br />to disrupt Russian military operations, secure<br />tactical advantages, and put pressure on Moscow.<br />Additionally, the fluid nature of the conflict,<br />with shifting frontlines and protracted fighting,<br />makes it plausible that Ukrainian forces could<br />maintain a foothold in contested areas by that<br />time.","Brooke McDermott (65%): The action of invading<br />Russia in August was extremely audacious for<br />Ukraine, especially because they lost some<br />vulnerable areas of Ukraine to reallocate soldiers<br />for the invasion. I think the intensity of the<br />decision demonstrates an intention to occupy for<br />as long as necessary.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (78%): I think this is<br />a difficult question. First, by Russian territory<br />are we referring to Russian-claimed territory? Or<br />the region of Kursk? I’m not sure how the winter<br />may affect war, but I think it may have an effect.<br />Ukraine has an overwhelming amount of support<br />from the West, and I think this will help them<br />still keep control of that territory. Russia is<br />focusing their resources in the east side of the<br />war and not Kursk. Russian media states (don’t<br />know how reliable this source is) that Russia<br />must sacrifice some things (in this case Kursk)<br />and focus on the greater good. My guess is that<br />Ukraine will be able to hold on to that territory<br />until the end of the year. Zelensky is focusing<br />his attention and resources to that area a lot<br />more and Putin has largely ignored these advances.","Vikram Bharadwaj (55%): I think if we look<br />further into this question, it becomes harder<br />to say whether or not this will occur. Given<br />that the Judge may have been swayed regarding<br />this question, it becomes increasingly difficult<br />to guess whether or not he will even place an<br />injunction. I think that in general this is<br />an extremely difficult question to gauge given<br />how disliked the election board's decision is<br />contrasted with the fact that they do seem to<br />be committed to making the deadline. While this<br />judge may have been the one to throw out Georgia's<br />abortion law, it is exceedingly likely that an<br />upper court will simply overrule that decision.","Kira Liscombe (72%): On Sept 20th, PBS News<br />Reported that Georgia’s State Election Board<br />voted to approve a new rule that requires poll<br />workers to count the number of paper ballots<br />by hand after voting is completed. Already, two<br />rules the board passed last month having to do<br />with certifying vote counts have been challenged<br />in two separate lawsuits. The rule was met with<br />criticism from experts and non-partisan officials<br />across Georgia. Three days ago, National and<br />Georgia state Democrats filed to block the rule.<br />They believe that this rule is unproductive and<br />unlawful. Supporters of the rule say it will<br />increase public trust in elections by making them<br />more transparent. Its a very divided issue, so<br />im not sure if the lawsuit will prohibit the rule<br />in time, so i give it an above medium chance of<br />occurring.","David Daniels (60%): I see two different<br />situations where this could happen. First, there<br />could be a state-mandated recount requested by<br />either campaign, or the ruling initiated by the<br />State Election Board (SEB) is upheld. Currently,<br />Trump is leading the polls in Georgia by a margin<br />slightly above the 0.5% required for a recount,<br />but things can change between now and November<br />5th. Secondly, I think it's somewhat likely,<br />but not guaranteed, that the Superior Court in<br />Atlanta might injunction this rule or strike it<br />completely. The information I have found regarding<br />this matter is split among legal scholars, with<br />no conclusive opinion prevailing. I think there<br />are more scenarios that result in a recount than<br />those that don't, which is why I believe there's<br />a 60% probability of hand-counted ballots. I would<br />say my nightmare scenario is if Trump wins Georgia<br />by a considerable margin and the Superior Court<br />of Atlanta rules in against the SEB ruling . This<br />effectively would null any changes of hand-counted<br />ballots.","Liv Payne (80%): This feels quite related to<br />our ceasfire question from a few weeks back. It<br />seems little has changed beyond the two countries<br />exchanging blows (Ukraine stole another tank, so<br />that's cool). They did lose Vuhledar, which might<br />shake them. The election is also looming near, and<br />Trump has said he will pull the US out of Ukraine.<br />In my opinion, this would be a killing blow for<br />the small country, as they rely heavily upon US<br />support in this invasion. So ultimately, I believe<br />that Ukraine is going to hold out for as long as<br />possible, and it would not be them withdrawing<br />from Russian territory as much as being overrun.","Liv Payne (15%): The GA election board recently<br />past a string of rules regarding the upcoming<br />presidential election. One such rule, passed 3-2<br />by Trump-supported (he actually called them \"pit<br />bulls\", I am not making this up) Republicans,<br />requires 3 people to hand count ballots, and<br />their numbers must align with one another and a<br />counting machine (it is important to note they are<br />not counting votes, but the ballots themselves).<br />However, according to a pending lawsuit (from<br />Democrats AND Republicans), these rules violate<br />GA law and ovedrstep their authority. GA Attorney<br />General Chris Carr warned the election board that<br />state legislature had not legally authoprized the<br />board to pass these rule, but he was ignored. The<br />trial started this Tuesday, going before Judge<br />Robert McBurney. Thus far, McBurney has said that<br />these rules need review, and it is concerning how<br />many new rules the Board is pushing through last<br />minute. It seems as though McBurney agrees with<br />the plaintiffs and will overturn the new rules,<br />but an article by CNN notes that, no matter the<br />result, there will likely be an appeal from the<br />losing side. Time is not on anyone's side here, as<br />the election is weeks away. I put my probability<br />low, but I would like to keep an eye on this case<br />as it works its way through the court system.","Edward Tsui (80%): According to BBC, Trump wants<br />to end the Russian-Ukraine conflict as soon<br />as possible per a meeting with Zelensky that<br />happened recently. I do not think the conflict<br />will be resolved with a Biden re-election , at<br />least anytime soon. If it were to be resolved<br />with a ceasefire agreement, it would be under<br />a Trump victory come November 5th. Even then,<br />his inauguration is in January, and I think he<br />would wait until he seized control so he could<br />take credit for the ceasefire. Per our previous<br />forecast, the crowd forecast for a ceasefire come<br />December 1st was 20%, and I think a relinquish<br />of Russian territory back to Russia would take a<br />Ukrainian total loss or a Ukrainian leverage.","Victor Avila (80%): When finding the probability<br />of this, I asked myself the questions: what would<br />require the Ukrainian military forces to leave the<br />occupied Russian territory in the Kursk region?<br />The answer to this I found would most likely be a<br />Russian invasion to take it back, or a diplomatic<br />end to the war which would remove the troops and<br />give the land back to Russia presumeably. Putin<br />stated in August that they would take the region<br />back in a \"timely\" manner. As troops continue<br />to focus in eastern Ukraine I find this highly<br />unlikely. The answer to the other question I find<br />less likely as Biden recently approved the use<br />of long range missiles which would escalate the<br />conflict to a wider war with Nato.","Jeffrey Markowitz (70%): Ukranian forces are<br />resilient and ceasefire agreements show no sign of<br />happening.","Jeffrey Markowitz (75%): The measure was already<br />approved by the georgia state election board.","Erin Ho (45%): In late September of this year,<br />the Georgia State Election Board passed a law<br />that required Georgia Precincts to hand count<br />ballots for elections. Now that I’m writing out<br />my thoughts, I think it’ll get removed because<br />there’s far more human error when it comes to<br />hand counting. Not only does it take so much<br />longer, but if there’s any mess ups, it causes<br />more stress, and we must start over. What’s more,<br />there’s a deadline the count has to be finished<br />by, and it will only cause more chaos during the<br />elections.","Leo Zegarra (65%): My probability reflects<br />the current stability of Ukrainian forces<br />in Russian-occupied territories amid ongoing<br />military engagements. Despite Ukraine's<br />operational successes, the unpredictable nature<br />of the conflict, including potential Russian<br />counteroffensives, leaves some uncertainty.<br />Continued carefulness from both sides suggests a<br />significant likelihood of Ukrainian presence until<br />December 1.","Edward Tsui (55%): Based on what I've seen, I<br />think this situation could go 50-50. However,<br />I have a slight lean to the fact given the<br />certification situation from 4 years ago with<br />Trump and Kemp; I believe the 3 board of elections<br />members will get there way. I believe Judge<br />Robert McBurney in Fulton may strike it based on<br />legality, but his recent comments that were quoted<br />on the Hill did not seem positively in favor of<br />that.","Leo Zegarra (83%): I believe there's a high<br />chance that poll workers in Georgia will be<br />required to hand-count paper ballots after voting<br />this November. This mostly stems from a recent<br />mandate by the State Election Board. While legal<br />challenges might surface, the prevailing sentiment<br />is that the requirement will likely stay in place,<br />ensuring transparency in the electoral process.<br />Many voters and advocates support this initiative,<br />believing it enhances trust in the election<br />results. Overall, it seems voters can expect this<br />hand-counting process to proceed as planned.","Abigail Harris (65%): When in doubt I find I give<br />more leniency to the status quo. If it’s unclear<br />what exactly is going to happen it’s also up in<br />the air if anything will happen at all. For the<br />requirements of this happening, it mostly hinges<br />on continued international backing for Ukraine<br />which is widely popular. Many European countries<br />have agreed to multi year funding and the United<br />States is tied into significant ongoing financial<br />assistance. Alternative evidence includes the<br />Presidential election, particularly with a Donald<br />Trump win, saying our support or the military<br />capabilities of Ukraine on the ground being<br />limited by personnel shortages and logistics with<br />equipment constraints.","Franco Bravo (35%): Due to ukraines push into<br />Russian territory, I believe that Russia will<br />be looking for any sort of counter attack and<br />also will not accept losing land in the long<br />run. Additionally, I feel like Ukraine is not<br />looking to gain lands, rather keep the lands they<br />previously held","Alexis Frazer (60%): Early voting in Georgia<br />starts on October 15. The earliest possible date<br />new rules could take effect if passed is October<br />14, which is just 22 days before the General<br />Election. The courts seem to be going back and<br />forth on this decision. Kemp refused a recount in<br />2020 so perhaps if they count by hand they will be<br />exempt from having to do a recount.","William Willis (40%): I have come up with the<br />probability that there will be a a 40% chance that<br />Ukrainian forces occupy Russia. I read an article<br />saying that Russia forces are in every part of the<br />city in Ukraine. Russia has been finding gaps in<br />the Ukrainian military and taking them. The war<br />has been going on. I found that Ukraine has been<br />developing new drones to deploy. That makes me<br />think that they are worried about having people<br />fighting but are looking at other options.","John Mathis (65%): From what Ive found, Putin is<br />far more focused on making n roads into Ukrainian<br />territory rather than focusing on the small bit<br />of Russian territory occupied by Ukraine. This<br />would make strategic sense since they are trying<br />to push far enough in on the weakened eastern<br />front in order to entice them back to the line out<br />of Russian territory. IF they make a large enough<br />push into Ukrainian territory, it might prompt<br />a retreat from Russian territory, so I hedged my<br />bets a little. There is not a ton of up to date<br />information, which also lowers the confidence of<br />my prediction.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): I am predicting a 75%<br />chance that Ukrainian forces will still occupy<br />Russian territory by December 1 due to Ukraine's<br />ongoing offensive success and Russia's military<br />challenges. Ukraine's strategic advances,<br />backed by strong international support, make it<br />likely they will hold onto gains. Additionally,<br />Russian forces have struggled with logistics and<br />morale, reducing the probability of a successful<br />counterattack.","Sara Whitmire (65%): If hand-counting ballots is<br />required, I believe it will be because of a close<br />race; as a swing state, Georgia’s votes are likely<br />to be close enough to warrant a hand-counting of<br />votes to avoid the \"stealing the election!!1!!\"<br />headache that happened last election cycle. In<br />2020, the vote came down to 11,700 votes and<br />a hand-counting was called for by the Georgia<br />Secretary of State. Hand-counting is an incredibly<br />difficult and inefficient process, given the size<br />of today’s electorate, but I believe a recount of<br />some sort will be called for due to the precedent<br />set by the 2020 election. Further historical<br />precedent would be the election between George<br />W Bush and Al Gore, where the votes came down<br />to a matter of thousands. In their Bush v. Gore<br />decision, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld<br />the final ballot count by the 3rd or 4th round<br />of double-checking, as the inauguration date<br />was coming up and a decision had to be made. I<br />anticipate something along these lines happening<br />again, as Trump will likely call for multiple<br />recounts.","Reece Slater (65%): As of now, Ukrainian forces<br />still control a large area of land in the Kursk<br />region. Putin previously placed a deadline on<br />pushing these forces out by October 1, and that<br />has not happened as of yet. I think some forces<br />have been removed, but not a substantial amount.<br />The only outcome I see as plausible is if Ukraine<br />pulls their forces out of the region in order to<br />better defend their homeland, as their troops are<br />currently stretched thin.","ladi fashogbon (12%): No western aid, the conflict<br />is more about pushing back Russian forces rather<br />than occupying Russian soil​( IISS), Military<br />constraints, Global pressures.","William Willis (55%): I gave this answer at 55%<br />probability of happening. I tried to apply what we<br />learned in the last chapter we read and take each<br />information bit by bit. I had a lot of trouble<br />picking a number for this. I feel like hand<br />picking won't making much of a difference. The<br />only thing that they should be doing is requiring<br />an id for voting to ensure for legitimate results.<br />But the fact that this is going to the legal<br />system and Georgia had so much backlash for fraud<br />votes last election I feel that they will take<br />extreme measures to count votes.","John Mathis (35%): As of yesterday, the ACLU<br />is suing the state of Georgia along with a slew<br />of other organizations.Furthermore, Law experts<br />with Propublica found that the changes are<br />less complaint with the law than a previously<br />introduced rule, which was voted down because,<br />believe it or not, it did not follow state and<br />federal election laws. The reason I hedge at 35<br />is because there is still a slight chance that<br />republican appointed judges in the state could<br />just ignore the actual letter of the law to make a<br />ruling.","Matthew Harvey (80%): The Russia-Ukrainian<br />Conflict is one that has many issues surrounding<br />territory gained. While I do acknowledge the<br />conflict going on and the issues surrounding it,<br />I believe this is a difficult one to predict.<br />However I don't forsee Ukraine being able to move<br />out of Russian Territory this quickly with so<br />little time until our deadline. It took the United<br />States months to get out of Afghanistan, and this<br />is without them seizing any of US territories.","Haley Ford (39%): I does not seem likely that<br />they will be able to hold the territory for long,<br />especially since it seems like it was more to<br />create a dilemma for Putin than keep that part<br />of Russia. Also, Ukraine is diverting their own<br />experienced troops to Kursk while still having to<br />defend their own borders.","Matthew Harvey (30%): I believe that ever since<br />the election board approved the hand counting of<br />ballots, everyone has considered the ramifications<br />it would have on elections in the state. This is<br />a means of holding up elections and postponing<br />calling the election. There are many precedents<br />before this that have nullified this new rule. i<br />believe this will be overturned.","Reece Slater (70%): Obviously, this all rides<br />on if the new Georgia voting law gets upheld or<br />struck down in court. I did a bit of research<br />on the judge presiding over the case, and he<br />is sending some mixed signals I think. His main<br />priority is election certification being on time<br />and not delayed, and this rule could possibly<br />lengthen the results. I think he might rule that<br />as long as certification is on time, poll workers<br />can count votes however they'd like.","Carson Ankeny (85%): There is simply no reason<br />for them to withdraw. There is not enough existing<br />pressure to get them to seek peace or withdraw<br />troops, and no realistic path towards such an<br />outcome. The only way there wouldn’t be troops<br />would be total Russian defeat which seems highly<br />unlikely.","Findleigh Ague (15%): There is a new requirement<br />for poll workers at Georgia precincts to hand<br />count each paper ballot to ensure that the amount<br />of physical ballots matches the amount digitally<br />scanned. Though this was technically made a<br />requirement, it has received a lot of backlash,<br />including legal action, because of its likely<br />ineffectiveness and unlawfulness. I don't think<br />that it will be actually set into place before the<br />election, considering it is just a month away, and<br />it honestly just really doesn't make any sense,<br />as it will likely cause errors and delay election<br />results and put a lot of pressure on poll workers.","Haley Ford (23%): It does not seem like it will<br />be able to occur before election time, especially<br />since ballot printing and poll worker training has<br />already commenced. Additionally, might not even be<br />within the jurisdiction of the Election Board."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.68000000000000005,0.53000000000000003,0.48999999999999999,0.17999999999999999,0.39000000000000001],"y":[4.9760077152634041,0.97479169734288007,1.9566608023829759,2.9596057706279679,3.9503523683873936],"text":["Crowd

After<br />debates, unclear policy, and playing into the<br />fear of Americans his chances of winning do not<br />look too probable. Kamala's campaign is focused<br />on instilling hope into Americans, meanwhile,<br />Trump is busy trying to stoke immigration<br />fears throughout the US. While this works<br />with some Republicans, his recent statements<br />regarding Haitian immigrants in Ohio have hurt<br />his credibility. This is the primary point on<br />which his campaign is built meaning he does<br />not have much else to run on. Combining this<br />with his endorsement of Mark Robinson and his<br />own controversies, his chances dip further.<br />The only recent bump he may have is regarding<br />his statements on FEMA which could increase his<br />chances slightly.","Abby Crowe (47%): I give a 47% chance that Trump<br />will win the 2024 US Presidential Election.<br />National polls favor Kamala Harris, but those<br />are also unreliable. I really don’t know so I am<br />keeping it close to the middle.","Jessica armour (46%): Based on recent polls and<br />predictions made, Harris is in the lead to win<br />the election. I decided on 46% because the BBC and<br />website 538 are predicting that he is coming in at<br />about 44-46% of support whereas Harris is leading<br />the majority.","Simon Gersten (85%): Based off current polling<br />and trends, it appears Donald Trump holds a fairly<br />firm grip on the election. He is polling beyond<br />the MOE in significant swing states, and unless<br />things change (they might), he will continue to<br />hold this lead.","Hayden Morehouse (55%): This is going to be<br />a close election and will be decided by swing<br />states. The pollong numbers are constantly<br />changing and the campaign trail is still hot so we<br />will see where this one goes.","Brooke McDermott (30%): Polls have been showing<br />Harris leading as soon as she announced that<br />she was running. Additionally, her campaign has<br />fundraised almost twice as much as Trumps through<br />individual donations and fundraising efforts.","Kira Liscombe (45%): Recent polls revealed that<br />Kamala Harris has a national lead of near about<br />3-4 points over Donald Trump. 538 uses polling,<br />economic and demographic data to explore likely<br />election outcomes and ran a simulation on who<br />Is favored to win the 2024 election. Harris wins<br />55 times out of 100 in their simulations and<br />Trump wins 45 times out of 100. Allan Lichtman<br />shared his forecast for the election, in which<br />he pointed out that we are rapidly becoming a<br />majority-minority country and old white guys<br />are on the decline. Kamala foreshadows where<br />our country is going in his opinion, and he<br />predicts she will win the election. Though many<br />acknowledged that it is likely to be a tight<br />race, I saw a high lack of predictions in favor<br />of Donald Trump winning. So, it seems like a less<br />than 50/50 probability of Trump losing, but not<br />certain enough to give him too low of a chance.","Vikram Bharadwaj (64%): Currently Donald Trump<br />has a solid lead in both Ga and Az, polling with<br />around 2 points. He is projected to also gain<br />ground and win NC right now, and with Harris only<br />projected right now to get WI, trump needs either<br />PA or Michigan or NV to win the election. Overall<br />Trump has probably the best chance to win the<br />election since 2016, given how strong his voter<br />base is compared to his competition. Doing the<br />math based on the current projection in polling<br />numbers, trump wis in 84% of universes, but given<br />how subject to change current elections are with<br />the news, I will shift this down to a 64, still<br />more likely than not by a good margin.","Minha Ahmad (51%): The presidential race will most<br />likely come down to seven states, Pennyslvania,<br />Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona,<br />Wisconsin, and Nevada. Right now, Trump is in the<br />majority for three, but is very close to winning<br />Pennyslvania. I think it is likely that Trump will<br />win, however, there is also a chance that Kamala<br />might overcome him in the polls.","Corinne O'Dell (48%): Although this is going to<br />be an extremely tight race, many national polls<br />are calling for Harris to slightly edge out<br />Trump. Harris performs better among mainstream<br />media consumers, while Trump dominates among<br />conservative media followers​. There are several<br />key states that are included in the tough battle<br />for 270 electoral votes. Harris has had mass<br />amounts of attention recently and is appearing to<br />motivate voters.","David Daniels (61%): Currently, there are a few<br />key swing states in play: Georgia (GA), North<br />Carolina (NC), Arizona (AZ), Michigan (MI), Nevada<br />(NV), and Pennsylvania (PA). Based on all the<br />election data I have compiled, it seems that the<br />election will likely be decided by Pennsylvania.<br />At the moment, Pennsylvania is a toss-up in terms<br />of who will win, but historically, Trump has<br />always outperformed his polls. This may be the<br />product of inaccurate polling or nonresponse bias<br />from right-leaning voters. Additionally, I have<br />come across data indicating that more Republicans<br />have registered in the last month compared to<br />their Democratic counterparts. Taking all these<br />factors into consideration, I have arrived at a<br />favorable probability of 61%.","Shayna Van Glish (43%): This is a tough question,<br />as I think that it will come down to one or two<br />states determining the winner of the election.<br />This election is very difficult to predict,<br />as there is a lot of negativity towards both<br />candidates. However, I think that there are more<br />anti-Trumpers than anti-Harrisers so I am giving<br />Trump a 43% chance of winning the election.","Reece Slater (51%): I think it will come down to<br />Pennsylvania. I think Trump takes GA, NC, and AZ,<br />Harris takes WI, MI, NV, then it's just down to<br />Pennsylvania. It's impossible to be very confident<br />for this question, but I will give the very slight<br />edge to Trump.","Jeffrey Markowitz (40%): Polling is in favor of<br />Kamala slightly right now.","Erin Ho (48%): Looking over current data on<br />the election and what the polls say about both<br />presidential candidates, I think it’s going to<br />be a tough race. The reason I went below 50% is<br />because Harris has a slightly higher percent of<br />the polls and is seen more favorably in the swing<br />states. That being said, anything can happen and<br />that’s why I’m sitting this close. If I’m being<br />honest; I hate this question.","Abigail Harris (45%): I make no attempts to hide<br />my distaste for polling data having had to both<br />rely on it and collect it, miserable as me and my<br />clipboard were. The data of today exemplifies a<br />great many of my concerns. The most recent data<br />out of Pennsylvania is a fantastic representation<br />of my most common - and loudest - complaints. The<br />margin of error 538 has for that race is around<br />3% with .6% margin in Kamala Harris’ favor.<br />Which to be clear does give her a slight edge<br />but also means absolutely nothing in the long<br />run. So I put my starting number at 50%. I am no<br />more certain Donald Trump will win than Kamala<br />Harris. 270 to win also confirms a less than 1%<br />margin for Harris on Pennsylvania with a larger<br />margin of error. With an opponent that has been<br />leading this state in past months that tends to<br />underpoll, occasionally dramatically, that could<br />spell disaster for a Harris white house, and my<br />Trump prediction. Depressingly unhelpful to say<br />the least. So now for some non-numeric, graciously<br />non-polling based information. Allan Lichtman<br />seems to rather famously corner the market on that<br />particular prediction. What a wonder, 13 simple<br />true or false questions. And like the data I see<br />currently, he gives Kamala Harris an eeked out<br />win. But he also gives her a key for incumbency,<br />something many Americans don’t feel is an accurate<br />statement. Plenty more are willing to acknowledge<br />her role as Vice President is not as powerful as<br />that as a former President, even one who allegedly<br />committed treason. Lichtman’s system is based on<br />incumbency which makes sense, an object in motion<br />will stay in motion until acted upon by an equal<br />or opposite force. As we political science majors<br />know it, incumbency advantage. But incumbency is<br />now disputed, and not on a small scale.","Liv Payne (47%): In order to determine the<br />probability of either candidate winning, I<br />decided to use the data from 270 To Win. Based<br />on the provided poll results from each state, I<br />calculated the number of electoral votes that each<br />candidate would theoretically win in that state.<br />However, some states, such as Alabama, Hawaii,<br />Idaho, etc, did not have data. So I looked at<br />how each state has voted in the past to determine<br />how they would vote this election (thankfully<br />none of the swing states needed this treatment).<br />I ended up with Harris receiving 276 votes and<br />Trump getting 262. This means that, out of 539,<br />Trump will receive 48.6%. This is higher than the<br />46.4% according to the national data, but still<br />relatively close (granted, we are looking at<br />individual polls versus electoral votes, so some<br />change is understandable). Therefore, I estimate<br />his likelihood of winning around 47%, just to<br />round it to a whole number.","Sara Whitmire (46%): I have been semi-obsessively<br />keeping up with this election since Kamala was<br />announced as the Democratic nominee, and I am<br />still hesitant to answer this question with<br />an absolute ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Support for Trump<br />ranges from fanatical to half-hearted, and the<br />Trump campaign has been emphasizing the Biden<br />administration’s failures and associating most of<br />them with Harris, as well as garnering support for<br />issues such as immigration and the economy. The<br />odds of the same party staying in power for two<br />presidential terms in a row are historically low.<br />With that being said, Harris has been strategic<br />about her campaign in swing states, celebrity<br />endorsements, media appearances. Tim Walz and<br />the campaign's messaging about issues such as<br />gun control and international relations appeal to<br />swing voters. I see her campaign as more strategic<br />and as the product of previous Democratic<br />nominees’ successes and failures in relation to<br />Trump, and predict that she will win the popular<br />vote and the electoral college.","Alexis Frazer (55%): While I do believe Kamala<br />Harris will win the popular vote in this election,<br />the election comes down to 8 swing states that<br />trump will most likely be winning the majority<br />of. Voter turn out is the ultimate deciding<br />factor, but based off the present polls, Trump<br />is projected to take hold of PA, GA, NC, and<br />AZ, which would turn the election in his favor.<br />Furthermore, Trump and Pence have been taking more<br />moderate approaches to controversial political<br />matters, such as abortion, which would entice some<br />votes who are on the fence to lean republican.","Colin Barry (58%): While the election is<br />forecasted to be incredibly close, Trump is<br />currently favored in more battleground states than<br />Harris is. This leads me to think that he will be<br />slightly more than likely to win the election as<br />he’s closer to winning more of the swing states.","Rommy Etzion (54%): Harris kind of looks like<br />she’ll get Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and<br />Pennsylvania 6, 10, 15, Trump looks like he might<br />get Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona 11, 16, 16,<br />Pennsylvania i have no clue, I have a feeling<br />towards Trump but it is vital for the blue wall,<br />19 Trump has an advantage over the economy,<br />immigration, and foreign policy and the advantage<br />of not being the previous head of state. Harris<br />is popular for her abortion and race policy, and a<br />strong debate. It will be very close","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (46.5%): We are at a<br />point in the election where either candidate could<br />possibly win. Had Biden stayed in the election,<br />this question would have been a lot easier to<br />answer. I know in class we have talked about the<br />unreliability of polls. Most of these show that<br />Harris is ahead but not by a comfortable margin.<br />I think that anything that happens in October<br />could really determine how the election goes.<br />Personally, I think that the candidate’s response<br />to Hurricane Helene may have switched up some<br />voters. I’m putting a probability of 46.5 because<br />I believe there’s a 53.5 chance Harris wins the<br />election.","Matthew Harvey (40%): I believe that Kamala Harris<br />has done less to alienate independent and voters<br />who were on the fence about both candidates than<br />Trump has. Also I would like to pay homage to<br />Allan Lichtman, a historian who has accurately<br />predicted presidential elections in the past for<br />9/10 times. He does it based upon keys rather than<br />polling data.","William Willis (75%): I believe that Donald<br />Trump has a probability of 75% to win the U.S<br />election. I read an article about Allan Lichtman<br />who has made many correct predictions about past<br />elections. He said that right now it looks like<br />Harris will win but, there needs to be a big<br />event in October for Trump to win. I think that<br />this Hurricane that occurred in Georgia and North<br />Carolina, really put in perspective that Kamala<br />doesn't care about the people. People are slowly<br />starting to realize this. This will give Trump<br />some key swing states.","Haley Ford (18%): Despite a very close race,<br />Kamala has a slight edge in many key states -<br />additionally recent economic conditions (though<br />not necessarily due to Kamala) will be in the<br />democratic party's favor.","Oladipupo fashogbon (48%): Trump is facing a slew<br />of legal issues, but has a strong fan base. If<br />economic conditions deteriorate or social issues<br />(like inflation or crime) become dominant, this<br />could play in Trump’s favor as voters may seek a<br />change. He has a just a little less in amount of<br />suporters as harris.","Leo Zegarra (45%): Donald Trump's chances of<br />winning the 2024 presidential election stand at<br />around 45-50%. Polls indicate a tight race, with<br />Trump maintaining strong support in key swing<br />states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. His base<br />remains energized, but ongoing legal challenges<br />and significant opposition make the outcome<br />uncertain. The race could ultimately hinge on the<br />swing voters, who often determine elections in<br />competitive states. Thus, we can expect a close<br />race and it is hard to give more than 5% on either<br />side of the 50%.","John Mathis (40%): He has been steadily losing<br />ground in key battleground AND previously likely<br />Republican states like TX and FL. It’s unlikely<br />that he catches up in these states in my opinion<br />because I think his base is established at this<br />point, but I hedge to 40 because underestimating<br />DJT is how he won in 2016","Edward Tsui (55%): I have narrowed down the<br />key swing states in the electoral college to be<br />Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan,<br />Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada. I have Harris<br />winning Nevada, but I have seen Polymarket's<br />forecast, and it has Trump winning North Carolina<br />and Pennsylvania, by small margins, but Georgia by<br />a significant margin. However, other sources have<br />alluded to a tossup for all three of these states.<br />At this point, this election is a 50-50, and most<br />polling sources are going to have its biases and<br />ideological leans. I'm going to follow the money,<br />and assume that most conservative voters are less<br />vocal about their politics. Both parties have<br />surveying and polling issues, but I''m going to<br />take a wild guess on the older age of conservative<br />voters not reaching polling opportunities as much<br />and assume that Trump may have a slight advantage<br />by a silent, small majority.","Findleigh Ague (35%): Most national polls show<br />Kamala Harris winning, but she only leads with a<br />few percentage points. The ones that show Trump<br />winning also only show a lead by a few percentage<br />points. Something to keep in mind is that many<br />national polls inaccurately predicted Biden’s<br />lead in 2020 and inaccurately predicted Hillary<br />winning in 2016, so they aren’t always full proof.<br />That being said, I just think it’s more likely for<br />Kamala to win, as I feel that people will vote for<br />change, aka someone that hasn’t even the president<br />before.","Joe Ornstein (45%): In all my adult life, I've<br />never seen the swing state polls this close<br />a month before a presidential election. And I<br />remember the 2016 election too well to place any<br />confidence in the notion that the \"Blue Wall\"<br />states (PA, MI, WI) will all go to Harris just<br />because she has slight leads in those polling<br />averages. A historically average polling error<br />is all that's necessary for Trump to win those<br />states and block Harris' most likely path to<br />victory---even if she wins the popular vote.<br />Obviously a lot can change in a month, and if the<br />polling averages shift significantly in that time<br />I'll change my assessment. But right now it is<br />basically a coin flip.","Gracie Culpepper (48%): This is so 50/50 I truly<br />cannot tell. I think Kamala has a slight edge<br />after the VP debate, but this could change at any<br />time."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.47999999999999998],"y":[1.0294404657557608],"text":"Crowd (48%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(TRUE,NA)","legendgroup":"(TRUE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":151.23287671232882},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will Donald Trump win<br />the 2024 US presidential<br />election?"],"tickvals":[1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will Donald Trump win<br />the 2024 US presidential<br />election?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"35d812414920":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"35d836b316d6":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"35d812414920","visdat":{"35d812414920":["function (y) ","x"],"35d836b316d6":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
