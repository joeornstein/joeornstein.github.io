Right now on<br />FanDuel you can pay $100 for the chance to win<br />$210 if the Chiefs win the Superbowl. That's a<br />bet that only makes sense if bookmakers think KC<br />has roughly a 100/(210+100) chance of winning, or<br />approximately 30%.","Joe Ornstein (58%): Every president elected<br />in the past 35 years has had a cabinet-level<br />nominee rejected or withdrawn from consideration<br />during their first few months, so it would be<br />historically unusual if it didn't happen with one<br />of Trump's nominees. That said, with 53 Republican<br />seats in the Senate, four Republicans would need<br />to join every single Democrat in order to sink<br />a nomination, and there are very few current<br />nominees where this seems plausible (Gabbard,<br />Kennedy, and Patel are likely to generate the most<br />controversy, but it would be surprising at this<br />point if four or more Republicans voted against<br />them). Of course, the cabinet-level picks are<br />just the tip of the iceberg: there are nearly<br />1300 presidential nominations that require Senate<br />confirmation. Most of these tend not to generate<br />controversy (e.g. military commissions), but there<br />are so many of them that the chances they are all<br />confirmed starts to get

Qiu (65%): During Donald Trump's first<br />term, he had multiple unsuccessful nominations,<br />so the Senate might be more careful in confirming<br />his nominations. For both of his presidential<br />terms, he has nominated people who are less<br />than qualified to run government agencies.<br />Mehmet Oz, nominee for Medicare and Medicaid<br />administrator, for example, is a celebrity doctor<br />who has promoted pseudoscience on many occasions.<br />Additionally, although there are currently more<br />republican Senator, the split is not too uneven.","Jessy Lee (25%): I think the probability of any<br />of President Trump’s nominees to be rejected<br />is fairly low. With a 53-47 Republican majority<br />in the upcoming Senate, most of Trump's picks<br />should clear the confirmation process as long<br />as Republicans stay united. Given the increasing<br />ideological divide between the two parties, almost<br />all Republican senators will support Trump's<br />selections, while most Democrats are expected to<br />oppose them.","Mia Pisani (21%): With a Republican-controlled<br />Senate, Trump's nominees will likely pass through.<br />Although some of his picks, like Pete Hegseth,<br />are controversial due to their personal history,<br />the polarized climate of the Senate leads me to<br />believe Republican Senators will unite to approve<br />these nominees. Nominees are most likely to<br />withdraw when it is clear they will not receive<br />support from Congress, and this is not the case.<br />However, several nominees, with controversies<br />similar to those of the current nominees, withdrew<br />during Trump's first presidency.","Kelsey Dyar (20%): Nearly all of Trump's picks<br />are controversial, but I do not think any of them<br />will withdraw from consideration; they currently<br />have unwavering support from the president-elect.<br />Pete Hegseth had a brutal confirmation hearing but<br />is still likely to be confirmed. I do not believe<br />enough republicans will be against confirmation of<br />any of the nominees.","Margaret Pope (20%): The senate only needs a<br />simple majority to pass a confirmation of a<br />nominee. Due to the current 53-47 Republican<br />majority in the senate, it is highly unlikely<br />any of the nominees will not be confirmed after<br />Trump's inauguration. Of the highly controversial<br />nominees, there are more Republicans serving on<br />the committees who administered their hearings. It<br />is also highly unlikely these individuals withdraw<br />from the process because they have already<br />undergone the hearing process and Trump has<br />been inaugurated. The senate has confirmed every<br />nominee since 1989; however, in Trump's first<br />term, three of his nominees withdrew.","Kyle Smith (15%): With the senate being republican<br />controlled all of trump's nominees will most<br />likely be confirmed. It is also rare for a nominee<br />to be rejected as it has only happened a limited<br />number of times. Some nominees may be withdrawn or<br />resign after a couple of years but in most cases<br />it happens after more than half a year. Though it<br />do not see it happening, there is always a slight<br />chance for it.","Kyle Smith (20%): In the past 5 years the Chiefs<br />have been in 4 out of the last 5 superbowls and<br />won 3 out of the past 4. They have to play the<br />Bills next and that is a really tough win. If they<br />win that game they still have to play either the<br />commanders or the Eagles and both of those teams<br />are a tough win as well. Though they are at about<br />a 30% chance by most analysts, they have a hard<br />path to the top this year.","Anna Rachwalski (20%): Only one of Trump's<br />2016 nominees were rejected or withdrawn from<br />consideration in 2017, during the first year<br />of his first presidency. However, during this<br />presidency, Trump has chosen more \"risky\" picks<br />with less traditional political backgrounds and<br />expertise in the area of the department they've<br />been chosen to lead. I don't think it's likely<br />that with the Republicans 51-45 majority (more<br />like 51-47 with independents) that any nominee<br />will be rejected. With only 1 nominee withdrawn<br />in 2016, when Trump's power was less solidified, I<br />don't believe it's incredibly likely that any will<br />be this time.","Riley Batz (7%): Since 1800, only 9<br />Senate-confirmation candidates have been rejected<br />and 17 withdrawn. The GOP currently has a 53-47<br />majority in the Senate, so Trump's nominees can<br />only lose a maximum of 3 votes if they want to<br />be confirmed- but the GOP Senators are likely to<br />back Trump's picks, especially given the partisan<br />ties in the Senate. Given there are 15 cabinet<br />positions, and Cabinet-level nominees have faced<br />an average of less than one vote in opposition<br />from senators of the president's party, I believe<br />the probability of any of the candidates being<br />rejected or withdrawn is 1/15, or 7%.","Ethan Joyce (75%): Throughout history only<br />handfuls cabinet appointees have been rejected<br />by the Senate. Of that amount, even less have<br />been rejected by a Senate that consists primarily<br />of members from the same party as the president<br />making the nominations. In the past 35 years there<br />hasn't been a rejection of a cabinet appointee in<br />the Senate. A potential explanation for this is<br />that presidential candidates don't pick cabinet<br />appointees who are perceived to have a low chance<br />of a formal rejection. Alternatively, candidates<br />who have a high probability of receiving a formal<br />rejection likely wont expend the political capital<br />to go for a cabinet position. However, considering<br />the nature of Trump's selections and his<br />presidency, I anticipate potential withdrawals as<br />a result of scrutinous questioning during Senate<br />confirmation hearings for either Tulsi Gabbard<br />or RFK Junior. Trump has had the most candidates<br />nominated to cabinets withdraw from consideration<br />of any president who has nominated members to<br />their cabinet.","Mabry Cartwright (40%): I placed the probability<br />of one of Trump's nominees being rejected or<br />withdrawn closer to no because the Republican<br />party holds 53 seats in the Senate. This makes<br />the nominations of Republican Donald Trump highly<br />likely to be confirmed, even with the occasional<br />outlier from both parties. Also, it is uncommon<br />for the Senate to not confirm nominees, despite<br />the fact that there are some controversial<br />nominees. Furthermore, It is not unusual for<br />a few nominees to withdraw, but this far into<br />confirmation hearings and after Trump has already<br />been inaugurated, it feels unlikely. Controversial<br />nominees, Like Kennedy, are why I am partially on<br />the fence.","Julia Loggins (72%): While notable nominees such<br />as Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are<br />facing scrutiny, the Republican-controlled Senate<br />of a 53-47 majority is likely to confirm most<br />if not all of Trump’s nominees. In addition, the<br />Senate rarely blocks nominations from the same<br />party. Of the nine Cabinet nominees who have<br />been rejected, only one was rejected by their own<br />party with such data showing a possibility of 11%.<br />Nonetheless, Matt Gaetz as well as Chad Chronister<br />have both withdrawn because of allegations and<br />backlash. If we are only predicting on if all of<br />President Trump’s nominees will be accepted, I<br />would say with around 72% certainty that they will<br />as a nominee being rejected by their own Senate<br />controlled party is very slim.","Emma Pastor (20%): I predict that the chances<br />of one of President Trump’s senate-confirmable<br />nominees withdrawing or being rejected from<br />consideration are around 20%. This is considering<br />that the US Senate currently has a Republican<br />majority, the party of President Trump. Looking<br />back at strictly cabinet nominees, only 9 in the<br />nation’s nearly 250 years have historically been<br />denied confirmation, while 19 have withdrawn,<br />both relatively small numbers in comparison to<br />the number of nominees the nation has seen over<br />the years. However, considering how polarized<br />the country currently is, and the relative<br />unpopularity of some nominees, I would not say the<br />chances of this occurring are zero.","Emma Peterson (10%): My reasoning for putting<br />my probability at 10% is because having a<br />Presidential nominee rejected is rare. I did<br />keep it at 10 because Matt Gaetz did withdraw his<br />name already so there is a chance it can happen<br />again. I also believe the Senate has a Republican<br />majority right now, and they are more likely to<br />pass a Republican President's nomination than deny<br />it. There has also only been 9 rejected nominees<br />in history, and 19 withdrawn names. With that<br />knowledge in mind I believe the probability has to<br />be low.","Hannah Carson (75%): I am fairly certain at<br />least one of President Trump’s Senate confirmable<br />nominees will be rejected or withdrawn from<br />consideration. I believe it is very unlikely that<br />the Senate will reject one of Trump’s nominees.<br />This is because the Senate is majority Republican,<br />and they would likely try to push through the<br />nominees President Trump suggests. However, I<br />do believe it is very likely that one or more<br />of his nominees will withdraw themselves from<br />consideration. They normally withdraw because of<br />public, or media pressure and the media is putting<br />a lot of negative attention on these nominees.","Maston Corn (10%): The Republican Party seems<br />to be currently very united and with the 53-47<br />lead that the Republican Party has in the Senate,<br />it seems like all of Trump's nominees will be<br />confirmed without much pushback. Marco Rubio was<br />confirmed unanimously by the Senate for Secretary<br />of State, and I believe that this very telling<br />of what the future holds. However, there might be<br />some hearings that draw some scrutiny such as Pete<br />Hegseth. Overall, all of the nominees should be<br />confirmed without a hitch.","Chinelo Ireh (90%): The probability that one<br />of President Trump's Cabinet nominations will<br />be rejected or withdrawn given the context of<br />what happened with Matt Gaetz and the general<br />controversy over some of his picks. Matt Gaetz<br />withdrew his nomination for Attorney General<br />because of his criminal charges and had to be<br />replaced by Pam Bondi. Other nominees such as<br />Linda McMahon for the Secretary of Education are<br />controversial because she has no tie to the sector<br />and has plans to make public education a matter<br />for the states.","James Martin (25%): I estimate that a 25%<br />probability that one of President Donald Trump's<br />Senate-confirmable nominees will be rejected<br />or withdrawn. I came up with this probability<br />by overviewing the past trends of the process<br />where most nominees tend to be approved if the<br />party holds the senate. However controversies can<br />play a big role in the process and during these<br />processes in the past, people of the republican<br />party where faced with lots of controversies and<br />scrutiny leading to heavy levels of withdrawals or<br />rejection.","Benjamin Jacobstein (75%): The republican majority<br />in the senate, though slim, increases the chances<br />of confirmation for controversial candidates such<br />at Pete Hegseth and RFK Jr, and many democrats<br />have already been open about being bipartisan.<br />However, according to CBS News over 17,000<br />doctors have signed a petition to urge the senate<br />to reject Kennedy over his stance of vaccines,<br />and according to the Advisory Board, over 75<br />Nobel Laureates have expressed concern that his<br />appointment could be bad to public health of<br />Americans. Despite these protests, I do believe<br />that he will be appointed and unless Trump tries<br />to test Congress' loyalty again by appointing<br />a candidate as controversial as Matt Gaetz,<br />then I do not see any of the current contenders<br />withdrawing.","Tristan Thompson (60%): I give this a 60 percent<br />chance of happening because while it is pretty<br />uncommon for a senate to vote against a nominee,<br />this group of nominees features a variety of<br />controversial appointees, and while Republicans<br />hold a senate majority, it is still only 53-47,<br />so it is very possible for at least one nominee to<br />be voted against. I also believe that it is more<br />than likely that at least one candidate will be<br />withdrawn. With Matt Gaetz personally withdrawing<br />himself from appointment, I can see it as more of<br />a possibility than not due to the controversial<br />nature of some of the nominees. Overall, I see<br />it being much more likely that at least one<br />of Trump’s appointees will be voted against or<br />withdrawn than I do for every single one of them<br />to be voted in.","Jerusalem Greenberg (25%): Donald Trump's nominees<br />are all in the same party as both him and the<br />party that controls the Senate. It is highly<br />unlikely, unless for extenuating circumstances<br />like severe sexual misconduct or provable abuse<br />of power, that any of his nominees would be torn<br />down, as it would look bad on their party and the<br />unity of the US government to get in the way of<br />President Trump's nominations.","Lawton Smith (35%): Historically, the likelihood<br />that the Senate rejects one of Cabinet nominees is<br />very unlikely and is rare. Only nine Cabinet-level<br />nominees have been explicitly rejected in U.S.<br />history, (most recent being John G. Tower in<br />1989.) However, it's more common for nominees<br />to withdraw when facing significant opposition.<br />Every president since George H.W. Bush has had<br />at least one Cabinet-level nominee withdraw under<br />such circumstances. And since we have already<br />seen one , in Matt Gaetz, I believe his other<br />appointments pass in a Republican held congress.","Addisen Kameron (10%): I’m not incredibly<br />confident but I think there’s a 10% chance<br />that one of Trump’s nominees gets rejected or<br />withdrawn. During his last presidency he had 5<br />withdrawn but they were over the whole course<br />of his presidency, only one was during the first<br />year. While Hegseth was a major concern, his<br />trial went relatively well, and with our nation's<br />history I don't think these new allegations of<br />spousal abuse will stop his confirmation. RFK,<br />Bondi, and Patel are also iffy but Trump’s riding<br />such a high right now the Republicans will keep<br />carrying him along out of pride and fear. He’s<br />already had two withdraw, so I doubt he’ll have<br />anymore.","Nathaniel Long (75%): During Donald Trump's first<br />presidency, he tied with John Tyler to have the<br />most cabinet members rejected/withdrawn from<br />his original nominations, 4 out of the 28 he<br />nominated, making a 14.2% chance. In addition, the<br />controversial nature of Trump and his appointees,<br />including recent sexual assault allegations<br />against Pete Hegseth significantly increase the<br />likelihood specifically of a consentual withdrawal<br />(no nominees have been rejected since 1989) for<br />at least one cabinet nominee, likely Pete Hegseth.<br />Further information is provided in my briefing.","Joshua Kang (30%): Patterns tend to show rejection<br />of cabinet nominees being rather rare, although<br />not unheard of. The most recent rejection would be<br />John Tower during the HW Bush administration. The<br />addition of the Senate being Republican controlled<br />would also help Trump in his chances in confirming<br />all of his appointments. As stated before, there<br />is still a chance of a rejection, with some of<br />the cabinet members facing some controversy - e.g.<br />Pete Hegseth, who is facing similar allegations to<br />John Tower.","Chloe Cooper (28%): In my briefing I go into more<br />detail, but with a 53 to 47 Republican majority<br />in the senate and a general trend of no nominees<br />being rejected since 1989, it seems highly<br />unlikely that any of President Trump's nominees<br />get rejected. This coupled with the likelihood<br />that republicans will simply vote party line makes<br />this conclusion more sound. The reason it's not<br />lower is it is still possible for allegations to<br />come out against a nominee which forces them to<br />withdraw from the race. Other than that it seems<br />very unlikely that any nominees don't make it.","Sreya Pandyaram (56%): There are a few ways to<br />look at this. It is important to note that while<br />rejections are rare, withdrawals are more common,<br />and also there are specific reasons why either<br />one could occur. It could be because of opposition<br />from partisans, media influence, or personal<br />issues of the candidate that intimidate party<br />presentation.For example, individuals like Andrew<br />Puzder, Ronny Jackson, and Lani Guinier were all<br />withdrawn even though their party controlled the<br />senate. Proving that having a majority in the<br />senate like Trump currently has doesn't always<br />mean that every nomination will be successful.<br />The reasons for these individuals withdrawal<br />were either due to unethical practices or a lack<br />of qualifications and support. However, Brett<br />Kavanugh is evidence that even with controversy<br />and dissatisfaction from some party members that<br />the republican majority helped him secure his<br />seat. Also previously, Trump's nomination of<br />Matt Gatez did not work out, and he had withdrawn<br />from attorney general. ABC news reports that most<br />of Trump's cabinet picks will get approved due<br />to the republican majority and also Trump's own<br />control over the party. It is stated that the same<br />party does not cause opposition. Confirmations<br />that seem doubtful are Pete Hegseth who is facing<br />sexual assault allegations, and just today had<br />his previous sister-in-law report that he was<br />abusive to his then wife. However his ex-wife had<br />confirmed that that was not true, and with Joni<br />Erst's support there seems to be a solid chance<br />for Hegseth to secure his seat. Nominations that<br />are still not secure are controversial figures<br />like Tulsi Gabbard, RFK jr, and Linda McMahon.<br />Therefore looking at this data, while a rejection<br />might not occur there could be a withdrawal. So<br />the chanced of wither a withdrawal or rejection<br />could be 56% because it is rare but not unlikely,<br />as also seen throughout Trump's previous term.","Sarah Joyce (30%): Although Trump has chosen<br />unconventional and controversial nominees, I<br />think it is unlikely that any will be rejected<br />or withdrawn at this point in the process. Matt<br />Gaetz, one of the most controversial nominees,<br />withdrew in November, so a nominee that did not<br />feel confident in being confirmed would also<br />probably have withdrawn by now. Furthermore,<br />Republicans have a majority in the Senate, which<br />makes it more unlikely that a nominee will be<br />rejected even if their qualifications might not<br />meet traditional or ethical standards.","Hampton Barrineau (95%): I predict with 95%<br />confidence that the Trump administration will<br />fail to appoint at least one senate-confirmable<br />nominee. Turnover within the Trump administration<br />was already at historical highs back in his 2016<br />administration, but once again Trump is nominating<br />highly controversial candidates with a lack of<br />skills. Many of Trump’s federal judicial nominees<br />did not pass the Senate due to lack of experience.<br />Now in 2024, we can see a similar scenario with<br />Pete Hegseth. Pete Hegseth is nominated for<br />Secretary of Defense despite only leading about a<br />thousand men during his tour of duty in the Middle<br />East and also having spent the vast majority<br />of his career as a pundit/host on Fox. On Fox,<br />Hegseth regularly made inflammatory comments on<br />the state of the military, attacking the military<br />leadership and rules of engagement on perceived<br />“wokeness”. His reactionary views not only make<br />him enemies in the military’s leadership, but<br />he has attacked many consensus positions like<br />allowing women to serve in active combat roles.<br />Additionally, Hegseth is being dragged brutally<br />through hearings as women from all over his<br />life, including his own mother and sister in-law,<br />have come forward stating that Hegseth regularly<br />abuses women and alcohol. Pete has dismissed<br />these without hesitation, but when asked about<br />his alcoholism, Pete responded stating he wasn’t<br />an alcoholic but he would stop drinking if he got<br />the cabinet position, which is frankly a common<br />sentiment expressed by alcoholics. Additionally,<br />Hegseth is comically unqualified. When asked to<br />name three countries in the ASEAN grouping, he<br />failed to name one correctly. This was on top of<br />many other questions of a similar issue. Moderate<br />Republicans have voted against Trump’s judicial<br />nominees before, notably moderates but also names<br />like Senator Kennedy of Louisiana. Given the Trump<br />administration already had to withdraw Matt Gaetz<br />for being a sex offender, I don’t think they are<br />going to have an easy time with confirmations;<br />Pete too is only one questionable nominee too.<br />Other candidates are similarly bat shit crazy.<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/senators-received-affidavit-containing-new-allegations-pete-hegseth-de-rcna188342<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna187909","Andy Wyatt (25%): Republican Senators are<br />coalescing around President Trump’s nominees,<br />including controversial ones like RFK and Pete<br />Hegseth. However, Tulsi Gabbard has a hard hill<br />to climb. 46% of Republican Senior Staffers on the<br />Hill think she will not be confirmed. If she does<br />not make it through confirmation, it will likely<br />be because she loses the vote in the Intelligence<br />Committee or she withdraws from consideration.<br />Unfavorable floor votes for Cabinet nominees<br />are very rare. Nevertheless, tradition is that<br />Presidents have their nominees confirmed, and<br />Trump’s weakest choice (Matt Gaetz) has already<br />withdrawn.","Emma Allen (60%): As of January 21st, Republicans<br />currently hold 53 seats in the Senate. I think<br />the Republican controlled Senate will more than<br />likely confirm most of Trump’s Senate-confirmable<br />nominees considering the partisan divide has<br />only grown greater in modern times. However,<br />because there is a significant number of<br />Senate-confirmable nominee positions and the<br />process can be so extensive, I think there's a<br />likely chance at least one nominee withdraws from<br />consideration due to personal scandals similar<br />to Matt Gaezt, who some believed withdrew from<br />consideration of AG because of the destructive<br />information that would be coming out of the ethics<br />report.","Grace Reichelderfer (30%): Trump’s cabinet has<br />been rather controversial. However, at this point<br />in the senate confirmation process, it seems that<br />all of his cabinet appointees have the votes to<br />be confirmed in their respected positions. Pete<br />Hegseth seemed to be the most likely to not be<br />confirmed, but it seems he has the votes now.","Benjamin Jacobstein (25%): The republican majority<br />in the senate, though slim, increases the chances<br />of confirmation for controversial candidates such<br />at Pete Hegseth and RFK Jr, and many democrats<br />have already been open about being bipartisan.<br />However, according to CBS News over 17,000<br />doctors have signed a petition to urge the senate<br />to reject Kennedy over his stance of vaccines,<br />and according to the Advisory Board, over 75<br />Nobel Laureates have expressed concern that his<br />appointment could be bad to public health of<br />Americans. Despite these protests, I do believe<br />that he will be appointed and unless Trump tries<br />to test Congress' loyalty again by appointing<br />a candidate as controversial as Matt Gaetz,<br />then I do not see any of the current contenders<br />withdrawing.","Ethan Marcum (12%): Republicans currently<br />hold the majority within the senate, which<br />makes it much harder for them to reject one of<br />his cabinet nominees. Also, 6 of the 9 total<br />cabinet rejections have come before the 20th<br />century, meaning the odds are already very low.<br />The last one was in 1989; however, the senate<br />was controlled by the Democratic Party and the<br />President at the time was of the Republican Party.<br />Trends also show that confirmation of cabinet<br />members has become more party driven as time has<br />gone on. Meaning, the odds that the republican<br />senate members will swear President Trump's<br />members in is likely. The only counter to this is<br />that many have some sort of scandal behind their<br />name, or have some sort of reason to not be sworn<br />in. I mainly think RFK Jr. has the most likely<br />odds of being rejected. There are some members who<br />have differing opinions to the Republican Party<br />and some can be seen as a threat.","Ethan Marcum (32%): This mainly is based on the<br />current betting odds among most respectable sites.<br />However, if you are looking at opponents, Josh<br />Allen is 0-3 when facing Mahomes in the playoffs.<br />The bills have been favorites to win in 2 of those<br />matchups, and one being in Buffalo. The chiefs<br />are the money line favorite and are 14-0 this<br />season when doing so. Also, they are home against<br />the Bills which helps. Also, going off of the eye<br />test, they seem to be peaking at just the right<br />time and the Bills did get a bit lucky against the<br />Ravens. The Eagles have the highest odds to win<br />the Super Bowl and will most likely face whoever<br />wins between the Bills and Chiefs, and will Riley<br />be favored. Based off of history and the eye test,<br />I think the Chiefs should have around a 65% chance<br />of winning this game, and then again a 50% in the<br />Super Bowl. Something that cannot be calculated<br />is being clutch and having grit, something this<br />Chiefs team always seems to have. They also have<br />won 5 straight AFC championships and 3 of the<br />last 5 super bowls. Not to mention that they are<br />back-to-back champs. I would give them the second<br />highest odds to win the Super Bowl, right behind<br />the Eagles, who on paper seem to have the best<br />overall team.","Mia Pisani (47%): I think the Chiefs will beat the<br />Bills in the AFC Championship. The Bills narrowly<br />beat the Ravens, and this was due to a lot of<br />offensive mistakes by the Ravens. Additionally,<br />the Chiefs' prior loss to the Bills will likely<br />motivate many players on the Chiefs. However, I<br />think the Eagles will beat the Commanders in the<br />NFC Championship and the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.<br />The Commanders have been playing well recently,<br />but the Eagles' defense has historically put<br />pressure on Jayden Daniels, leading him to throw<br />interceptions. Jayden Daniels is an incredible<br />quarterback, but the rookie is likely to struggle<br />against the Eagles' defense. The Eagles lost to<br />the Chiefs in the Super Bowl in 2023, which may<br />cause a revenge sort of mentality that would<br />benefit Eagles players. The Chiefs also are not<br />the same team they were two years ago.","Riley Batz (30%): To make it to the Super Bowl,<br />the Chiefs must defeat the Bills this weekend, and<br />they are currently a 1.5 point favorite. Though<br />they lost to the Bills earlier in the season, I<br />believe the Chiefs have a 55% chance to win this<br />game because it is a home game and the Bills<br />are only 8-4 on the road. The Eagles are 6 point<br />favorites over their opponent in their ticket to<br />the Super Bowl, resulting in the Chiefs playing<br />the Eagles in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs have a<br />50% chance of winning this game. Based on this<br />math --> .55 * .50 = approximately 30%.","Jacob Weiss (30%): I did a probability tree<br />branching out from the AFC championship game.<br />From the AFC championship game a made another<br />branching out from each probable winner of the NFC<br />Championship Game. Further from that i Branched<br />out each team from winning the super bowl which<br />means there are 8 combinations of Superbowl<br />winning teams two are the Chiefs which is .25<br />probability of a chiefs outcome in a victory.<br />Sports betting odds have a higher chance of the<br />Chiefs beating the Bills so it is logical to shift<br />the probability of them winning upward.","Julia Loggins (30%): According to current insights<br />from DraftKings, the Chiefs have a 31.2% chance of<br />winning the Super Bowl in 2025. Another statistic<br />shows the Chiefs odds to win the Super Bowl at<br />+200 aligning with the previous statistic. In<br />addition, one of their top wide recievers Mecole<br />Hardman would be absent from the Super Bowl if<br />the Chiefs were to make it. The Chiefs have also<br />won the last two Super Bowls. With that, no team<br />has ever won 3 consecutive Super Bowl titles ever.<br />The difficulty of winning 3 Super Bowls in a row,<br />Hardman’s absence, and competition from other<br />elite teams makes it extremely hard for the Chiefs<br />to win.","Hannah Carson (70%): I believe there is a 70%<br />chance that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the<br />Super Bowl. I think this because they have won the<br />Super Bowl the last 2 years. Additionally, Patrick<br />Mahomes is also one of the best quarterbacks in<br />NFL history. He has several Super Bowl Victories<br />and MVP awards. I didn’t put higher because there<br />is still 4 teams in the running for the Super Bowl<br />and there is always a chance they get beat, but I<br />feel like they have a good chance of victory this<br />year.","Isabella Molina (75%): As of now, a few of<br />President Trump's nominees have already withdrawn,<br />it is highly possible that further nominees may<br />be rejected or withdraw due to their complicated<br />background.","Isabella Molina (89%): The Kansas City Chiefs<br />are strong contenders for the 2025 Super Bowl<br />due to their consistent performance. Their coach,<br />Andy Reid, has led the team to five Super Bowl<br />appearances, winning two. Considering they won<br />the Super Bowl last year, their track record<br />is impressive, making them strong candidates to<br />return and win again. The Chiefs have been to five<br />Super Bowls: in 1967, 1970, and recently in 2020,<br />2021, and 2023. Their recent appearances, so close<br />together, show they are on a roll. From the 2000s<br />Super Bowls, they won two out of three games,<br />which suggests their chances are high.","Isabella Molina (75%): President Trump's<br />administration is already known for withdrawals<br />from candidates. For example, Trump has had two<br />nominees withdraw: Matt Gaetz and Chad Chronister.<br />This pattern, seen even before Trump took office,<br />is concerning but not surprising, as some of the<br />candidates face backlash from the public. Because<br />of this, I predict there will be another candidate<br />withdrawing from Trump's administration. While it<br />seems most of his remaining nominees are expected<br />to stay, some are facing controversies that could<br />hinder this, leading to more withdrawals or even<br />rejections by the Senate.","Elliana Williams (25%): I chose a low probability<br />because it is very rare for a Senate confirmable<br />nominee to be rejected, especially if the Senate<br />is the same party as the President. Only 9<br />nominees for Cabinet positions have ever faced<br />rejection. Though Trump is controversial as a<br />person, I do not think it is probable that one<br />of his nominees will get rejected. However, I<br />will not say it is impossible, since not all<br />Republicans in the Senate support him.","Brooke Cheney (30%): The probability of the<br />Chiefs winning the Super Bowl depends on who they<br />play. They will either play the Commanders or the<br />Eagles. Based on the Las Vegas line, the Eagles<br />are favored by a good amount. When the Eagles and<br />Chiefs stats are compared, the Eagles have more<br />sacks, more recovered fumbles, and more fumbles<br />forced. These stats are especially important in a<br />high stakes game as mistakes are likely. However,<br />I am still not extremely sure because the Chiefs<br />have experience in these times of matchups, and<br />they have a veteran coach.","Elliana Williams (75%): I think the Chiefs will<br />take their third straight super bowl title in<br />2025. The Chiefs are performing better than they<br />have in past seasons, and so it makes sense that<br />they would follow through and win again. They have<br />to beat the Bills this weekend in order to make<br />it to the Super Bowl, and I predict it will be the<br />Eagles vs the Chiefs in the final game. The Chiefs<br />have a better defense, offensive line, and running<br />ability.","Wyatt Dasher (68%): Trump has been pushing for<br />the national security confirmations to get quickly<br />after the terriorist attack and these are the most<br />argued people. Examples like kash Patel. I also<br />don't know how RFK jr. Is going to go but I feel<br />that there is a better likely hood of everyone<br />passing. But it is not 100% because it is an all<br />or nothing question.","Matthew Newby (95%): The senate and house are both<br />republican controlled and since president Trump<br />is a republican it is very unlikely that any of<br />his nominations will not be accepted by his fellow<br />party members.","Matthew Newby (90%): I think there is a 90% chance<br />the chiefs do not win the superbowl. I think they<br />have a low chance to win the superbowl because the<br />teams they would have to play to get there are in<br />my ppinion, better than them in the first place.","Kelsey Dyar (70%): I predict there is a .7<br />chance that the chiefs will win the super bowl.<br />DraftKings set the Chiefs' odds to win at +240<br />with an implied probability of 29.41%. The Chiefs<br />currently have the best odds to win out of all<br />teams left in the playoffs. Patrick Mahomes also<br />has a playoff win percentage of .842, the best for<br />any quarterback with 10+ postseason starts. I am<br />going high because I do believe the Chiefs will<br />pull off the three-peat.","Anna Rachwalski (30%): The Chiefs still have to<br />beat the Bills to get there. As of the morning<br />of the 23rd, they were only a 1.5 pt favorite<br />over the Bills, meaning their win to even get to<br />the Super Bowl isn't confirmed. If they do win<br />and play the Eagles, they currently are slight<br />underdogs in that match up. I think they have a<br />chance, but not over 50%, and betting markets are<br />currently saying roughly 28%–30% to me seems good<br />with the \"Chiefs are rigged to win\" rhetoric.","Margaret Pope (31%): The Chiefs play at home<br />against the Bills on Jan. 26, and they are<br />currently 9-0 at home. Their defense has been<br />similar to the Bills, but the Chiefs have been<br />able to complete more offensive plays than the<br />Bills. If they beat the Bills, they will advance<br />to the Super Bowl and play either the Eagles or<br />the Commanders. The Super Bowl will be played in<br />neutral ground in New Orleans, so neither team<br />will have an advantage. According to Fox Sports,<br />the Chiefs have a 22% chance of winning the super<br />bowl, which are decently good odds. I think their<br />probability is higher because when they play well,<br />they win.","Jessy Lee (45%): The Kansas City Chiefs have a<br />leading record holding the most amount of wins<br />and least amount of losses in the entirety of<br />the American Football Conference. They also have<br />the highest team winning percentage in the AFC.<br />Although they may be dominant in the AFC, teams<br />like the Vikings, Eagles, and Lions have better or<br />close team winning percentages.","Teya Hagy (45%): It is not historically common<br />for the senate to reject the cabinet nominees. My<br />number is still fairly high because Matt Gaetz is<br />under an investigation for sexual misconduct and<br />he could be removed. However, it is still unlikely<br />for this to happen.","Teya Hagy (55%): I think that they have a medium<br />probability of winning, however there is still<br />a chance that a team like the Eagles will win<br />because they have a stronger defense.","Lillie Puhrmann (68%): While it is rare for Senate<br />nominees to be rejected or withdrawn, I put a<br />higher probability as some of the candidates come<br />with controversy. Matt Gaetz has already withdrawn<br />because of his previous scandals, so the two left<br />with high controversies are Pete Hegseth and Tulsi<br />Gabbard. They both have some uncertainties due to<br />their past. I believe those two candidates are the<br />only ones that will possibly be rejected. Since<br />the upcoming Senate will be majority Republican,<br />Trump's candidates are in favor.","Lillie Puhrmann (42%): Football can be difficult<br />to make predictions on, but the Kansas City Chiefs<br />are contenders for winning the Super Bowl this<br />year. The reason my number is lower is because<br />of how unpredictable football can be. I find that<br />this number reflects their position as one of the<br />favorites, but also highlight their track record,<br />injuries, and strength of their competitors. While<br />they have a solid chance, you never know what can<br />happen on that day.","Bennie Trujillano (45%): Many of the nominees<br />are involved in some form of controversy and I<br />wouldn't be shocked if maybe one candidate is<br />rejected by the senate. However, considering the<br />GOP majority in the senate and every other branch,<br />I don't see Trump having that much trouble getting<br />his cabinet members into office.","Angela Jacobs (100%): Over the years, the vast<br />majority of presidential nominees have been<br />confirmed by the Senate with confirmation rates<br />hovering around 85-95%. However, with today’s<br />highly polarized Congress, the confirmation rate<br />for judicial and executive branch nominees can<br />dip due to partisan opposition. Many nominees<br />still get confirmed despite opposition, so a 90%<br />confirmation rate is a reasonable estimate. To<br />calculate the probability that all 1,300 nominees<br />are confirmed, I multiplied the probability of<br />confirmation (0.9) for each nominee across all<br />1,300 nominations. I used the complement rule and<br />got P(All Confirmed)= 0.9^1300 ≈0.0000000002% or<br />99.99999998%. So the likelihood one of Trump’s<br />nominees withdraws or is rejected is 100%.","Angela Jacobs (28.47%): The Chiefs’ path to<br />winning the Super Bowl involves beating the Bills<br />in the AFC Championship and then beating either<br />the Eagles or the Commanders in the Super Bowl.<br />Chiefs have a 55.6% chance of beating the Bills<br />(from current stats). Eagles have a 75% chance of<br />beating the Commanders to reach the Super Bowl,<br />leaving the Commanders with 25%. Chiefs’ chances<br />of beating each Super Bowl opponent are 45%<br />against the Eagles and 70% against the Commanders.<br />For each possible outcome (ex:, Chiefs beat Bills<br />→ Chiefs face Eagles → Chiefs win), I multiplied<br />the probabilities of each event in the sequence. I<br />then added the probabilities of all branches where<br />the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. Chiefs beat Bills<br />→ Beat Eagles = 18.74% Chiefs beat Bills → Beat<br />Commanders = 9.73% Adding these probabilities:<br />18.74% + 9.73% = 28.47% chance of the Chiefs<br />winning the Super Bowl.","Bennie Trujillano (55%): I'm ninety-five percent<br />certain that the super bowl game will be between<br />the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles<br />again. Assuming this is true, I'd say the odds<br />on that game are 50/50. However, if I'm forced<br />to make a prediction, I'd say the Kansas City<br />Chiefs will win as they have had more playoff<br />appearances, more super bowl wins, and more<br />consistent player/team statistics in recent years<br />than the Philadelphia Eagles.","Grace Mccann (25%): One of the main reasons for<br />the low probability is that the Republican Party<br />currently controls the Senate. This makes it<br />much easier to get the nominees through because<br />there are fewer democratic votes in play. One of<br />the most controversial nominees is Department of<br />Defense nominee Pete Hegseth; however, despite<br />his many controversies, many Republicans have<br />still shown firm support for him. There are only<br />three Republicans on the fence for him: Former<br />Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of<br />Kentucky, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, and Sen.<br />Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Beggin, Riley. “Who Has<br />Donald Trump Nominated for His Cabinet? The Latest<br />on the Nominees.” USA Today, January 23, 2025.<br />https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/23/trump-cabinet-nominees/77890492007/.","Brooke Cheney (82%): In every presidency dating<br />back to George H.W. Bush’s term, at least one<br />Cabinet-level nominee has withdrawn. However,<br />since Matt Gaetz already withdrew, I had more<br />difficulty figuring out if another would withdraw.<br />Pete Hegseth appears the most controversial<br />pick because of allegations of womanizing and<br />a drinking problem. In addition, according to<br />USToday, Russell Vought only made it out of the<br />committee vote with an 8-7 split. Given the number<br />of controversial characters, I believe at least<br />one more will withdraw. Though the Republicans<br />have control of the Senate, Neera Tanden and<br />David Chipman, two of Biden’s nominees, withdrew<br />from the nomination process during a Democratic<br />trifecta in 2021.","Grace Reichelderfer (55%): At the current state<br />of the Senate confirmation process of Trump’s<br />nominees, it appears that almost all of Trump’s<br />nominees will be confirmed. With Republicans<br />holding a 53-47 majority, 4 Republicans would<br />have to reject a nominee (with VP JD Vance as the<br />tiebreaker) to reject a nominee. Arguably the most<br />controversial remaining nominee is Pete Hegseth.<br />News broke today (1/23) that Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)<br />would vote to reject the confirmation of Hegseth.<br />A handful of other Republican Senators have also<br />expressed their doubts about his ability to lead<br />the Pentagon. It will come down to the wire for<br />Pete Hegseth.","Grace Reichelderfer (35%): No team has ever won<br />three years in a row. Additionally, the Bills have<br />already beat the Chiefs during the regular season.<br />If the Chiefs do beat the Bills and make it to<br />the Super Bowl, they will face either the Eagles<br />or the Commanders. The Commanders just upset the<br />15-2 Lions with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels<br />who is looking as strong a quarterback as any.<br />Additionally, the Eagles put up two convincing<br />wins against the Packers and the Rams. I don’t see<br />the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl for the third<br />year in a row.","Mabry Cartwright (30%): Although I typically<br />favor the Chiefs in postseason matchups, I am<br />placing the probability that they win at 30%.<br />I calculated this percentage using various<br />moneyline predictions converted into percentages.<br />Also, the majority of the articles I read favor<br />the Eagles, which seems like the most likely<br />outcome. Furthermore, the Buffalo Bills will be a<br />challenging opponent, and Mahomes’ ankle injury is<br />an underlying factor.","Diane Johnson (85%): Using Matt Gaetz’s sexual<br />assault controversy as an example, several other<br />of Trump’s nominees have similar allegations<br />surrounding them; including Pete Hegseth and<br />Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As these cases develop, it<br />is almost certain that the outcome will be similar<br />to Matt Gaetz and that they will be withdrawn,<br />either by force or by choice. Furthermore, there<br />are other controversial nominees for different<br />reasons. Both Tulsi Gabbard and Doug Burgum have<br />been called controversial by democrats for their<br />extreme rightist stances on political issues such<br />as climate change and U.S intelligence.","Grace Reichelderfer (30%): At the current state<br />of the Senate confirmation process of Trump’s<br />nominees, it appears that almost all of Trump’s<br />nominees will be confirmed. With Republicans<br />holding a 53-47 majority, 4 Republicans would<br />have to reject a nominee (with VP JD Vance as the<br />tiebreaker) to reject a nominee. Arguably the most<br />controversial remaining nominee is Pete Hegseth.<br />Today, the Senate voted to advance his nomination<br />to his final confirmation with a vote of 51-49. It<br />seems unlikely that someone will change their vote<br />with just a day before his final confirmation. It<br />will come down to the wire for Pete Hegseth.","Tristan Thompson (35%): The Chiefs have had a<br />phenomenal season and past two years, however,<br />I do not believe that their Super Bowl winning<br />streak will continue into a third year. It is<br />hard enough to win two Super Bowls consecutively,<br />but winning three in a row has yet to even be<br />proven possible. The Chiefs are facing a very<br />tough schedule moving forward, and I believe that<br />each team has a chance at winning it all, making<br />it unlikely for the Chiefs to win it for a third<br />year.","Jake Garrard (65%): It is rare in general for<br />a president's cabinet nominee to be rejected<br />via vote of the Senate in the past, with only<br />9 total nominees in history being rejected by<br />vote. However, since President George W. Bush,<br />at least one cabinet nominee has withdrawn from<br />consideration in every President's cabinet. With<br />this in mind, I don't believe any of the nominees<br />will be rejected by vote, but it is likely that<br />at least one of the nominees will withdraw from<br />consideration.","Ethan Joyce (30%): I took the odds from a popular<br />sports book and calculated the adjusted implied<br />odds of the KC Chiefs winning, which was about<br />30% or the second highest odds of any team still<br />in the competition. Since odds are influenced<br />sometimes by public sentiment and bookmaker<br />strategies, they may not perfectly align with the<br />actual probabilities. However, if the odds are<br />efficient and based on sound market data/sports<br />data, the estimate should be reasonably accurate.","Jake Garrard (37%): The Chiefs have a strong<br />chance of winning the Super Bowl, however, with<br />2 games left ahead of them, one of them being<br />to a team they've already lost to this season,<br />I cannot predict that it is likely that they<br />will end up winning. The Chiefs are only favored<br />to win their upcoming game against the Bills by<br />2 points, making their chances of winning only<br />slightly higher than 50%. The following game will<br />be against either the Commanders or the Eagles,<br />neither of which they have played yet this season.<br />In this scenario, I believe the Chiefs have just<br />above a 1 in 3 chance of winning the Super Bowl.","Maston Corn (40%): The Kansas City Chiefs have put<br />together an impressive season with a record of 15<br />wins and 2 losses. They secured the top spot in<br />the AFC this season and have odds of +225 to win<br />the Super Bowl, second to only the Philidelphia<br />Eagles. They beat the Eagles last year in the<br />Super Bowl by a score of 38-35. However, no team<br />has won three consecutive Super Bowls, and the<br />Chiefs are aiming to be the first team to do so.<br />They have a good chance of winning the Super Bowl.","Ruby (50%): The political makeup of the<br />Senate at the time will heavily influence the<br />confirmation process. If there's a divided or<br />Democratic-majority Senate, nominees may face<br />opposition. I also think that any of his highly<br />unpopular nominees may be pressured by the public<br />to withdraw because of how much media attention<br />surrounds Trump's Senate-confirmable nominees.<br />I will say, plenty of nominees who have faced<br />scrutiny have still been confirmed.","Benjamin Jacobstein (31%): According to the latest<br />odds, per Fox Sports, the Philadelphia Eagles are<br />favored to win the Super Bowl at +180, followed by<br />the Chiefs at +220, and the Bills at +260. Using<br />implied probability to convert the betting odds to<br />the likelihood of this outcome occurring, we get<br />31.25%, rounding to 31%.","Aaliyah Diaz (50%): I believe that his nominees<br />will face rejection or be withdrawn based solely<br />on the controversy surrounding them. For example,<br />Peter Hegseth. who has been nominated for<br />Secretary of Defense has pending allegations that<br />may cause complications.","Emma Pastor (66%): Given that the Chiefs have<br />won two of the last four Super Bowls, there is a<br />higher probability than most teams that the Chiefs<br />could win again this year. For the AFC title,<br />this is the Chief's 7th year in the championship<br />game, with a record of 4-2 (both losses being in<br />overtime). The Chiefs are currently favored to win<br />against the Buffalo Bills. However, if the Chiefs<br />win against the Bills, and are faced by a strong<br />team like the Eagles in the Super Bowl, the Chiefs<br />might see some tough competition - the Chiefs only<br />have 1 win over the Eagles at the moment.","Ava Herring (65%): I believe that it is more than<br />likely that one of his elected Senate members<br />will be rejected or withdrawn because this has<br />been a common occurrence in the history of the<br />American presidency. The members that Donald Trump<br />has elected have had conflicts over interests and<br />ideological mindsets. Political tension is high<br />now, and differing opinions can cause tension.","Ava Herring (45%): I believe that the Chiefs have<br />a solid chance to win the Super Bowl. However,<br />they are up against strong competition. If they<br />play against the Eagles, then they will have<br />to play a very good game in order to win the<br />Super Bowl, but based on their past wins, they<br />definitely have a chance to take it home.","Vangeli Tsiaras (40%): Pete Hegseth is arguably<br />Trump's most controversial nominee for his<br />second cabinet. Hegseth's nomination was recently<br />advanced by the Senate (51-49) with two Republican<br />Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins voting<br />against. With Mitt Romney not serving in the<br />Senate any longer makes Senators Murkowski and<br />Collins practically the only Republican Senators<br />that would vote against Trump's nominees. Trump's<br />first nominee, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, was<br />voted and confirmed unanimously as Secretary of<br />State on January 20th. One other nominee who could<br />be a possible hurdle though, and is the primary<br />reason I put my percentage up to 40, would be<br />Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi's reported ties to Vladimir<br />Putin and Bashar Al-Assad could hinder her chances<br />to advance as Director of National Intelligence.","Andy Wyatt (30%): The Chiefs are averaging about<br />+220 odds in betting markets, translating to a<br />31% chance of winning the Super Bowl. The Athletic<br />forecast, based on 100,000 simulations of the<br />conference championships and the Super Bowl,<br />assigns a 30% probability that the Chiefs take<br />home the trophy. Based upon alignment across the<br />market and projections, a 30% chance of victory<br />for the Chiefs is a reasonable prediction.","Rebecca Mcadam (1%): I think that this is highly<br />unlikely, given that it is unusual for Senate<br />to reject a nominee. Also, the senate is a<br />Republican majority, meaning that a Republican<br />president's cabinet will be more favored. Also,<br />Trumps nominees have long since been announced,<br />so it is unlikely that they would withdraw from<br />consideration this late.","Jerusalem Greenberg (75%): I know next to nothing<br />about American football, football culture, or<br />anything relating to football, but I do think that<br />in a way, the games are somewhat rigged to make as<br />much money as possible. If there is a way for the<br />NFL to make more money off of football enjoyment<br />from people who don't enjoy or care about sports<br />-- in this instance, people who like Taylor Swift<br />an obsessive amount -- they'll do whatever they<br />can to make that outcome happen. It's very likely<br />in order to draw in as many TS fans as possible<br />for profit.","Quintin Gallardo (30%): With the current state of<br />the NFL and accusations of referee interference<br />it could be easy to claim that there is no chance<br />that the Chiefs do not win the Super Bowl this<br />season. Though they set their regular season<br />winning record, most games were won by less than<br />1 possession. This could be a tactic, but with<br />statements from members of the team, such as<br />Patrick Mahomes, claiming stern frustration with<br />the clutch wins this is unlikely. Additionally,<br />they had a decisive loss earlier in the season to<br />the Bills, their AFC Championship opponent and the<br />best team remaining.","Vangeli Tsiaras (45%): In my opinion, Super Bowl<br />LIX will be a close game. I predict that the<br />Chiefs will win their game against the Buffalo<br />Bills on Sunday 01/26 and will thus advance to<br />the Super Bowl. In the Super Bowl they will either<br />play the Eagles or the Commanders, where they will<br />play a tough and tight game and narrowly lose to<br />one of these teams. The most recent Chiefs-Eagles<br />game in November 2023 was won narrowly by the<br />Eagles 21-17. The Commanders have also recently<br />been strong by winning their last 7 games back to<br />back.","Quintin Gallardo (20%): Assuming Gatz doesn't<br />count. Despite the controversial figures up for<br />confirmation, my belief is that none will be<br />rejected by congress, but I believe there is a<br />slim chance that they might, in order to protect<br />their future political aspirations, withdraw<br />themselves. The reason, in regards to their<br />confirmations, being that the Senate is currently<br />led and headed by the majority Republican chamber.<br />They have seemed to, for the most part, agree<br />with most of Trump’s controversial policies and I<br />find it hard for them to part ways on something as<br />trivial as cabinet members in comparison to other<br />policies.","Archita Gaur (62%): Only one nominee has been<br />confirmed - Marco Rubio. He received a unanimous<br />vote from the GOP Senate. Republicans control<br />the chamber 53-47. Each nominee can lose only<br />three Republicans and still get confirmed. The<br />nominee I believe that will fail is Pete Hegseth.<br />The Senate only voted 51-49 to advance, that<br />means two Republicans already have voted against<br />him. I believe he could fall and that is why my<br />probability is more than 50%. I also believe Kash<br />Patel might face challenges.","Archita Gaur (87%): One has to keep in mind that<br />there has never been a time in the NFL where a<br />team has one three consecutive super bowls and<br />this would be the first time if the Kansas Chiefs<br />win. I analyzed fox news for some information.<br />The Chiefs have the second best odds in the NFL to<br />win, at + 220. They predicted that the Chiefs had<br />a 31.2% chance of winning. I also found another<br />website that used AI to make a prediction. AI<br />predicts that the Eagles will win 28-27. There<br />are many that give Eagles a 52% chance of winning<br />and higher odds. However, many football \"pundits\"<br />argue that the Chiefs will win based not he<br />regular season.","Joshua Kang (40%): No NFL team has ever won a<br />Super Bowl three times in a row. However, key<br />players like Patrick Mahomes have remained healthy<br />through the season, as well as their strong<br />performances this season, gives them a solid<br />chance of a third straight Super Bowl win.","Ayaan Fazal (95%): Yes, I beileve that President<br />Trump will have nominees that are rejected or have<br />withdrawn. Historically, this has always been the<br />case (rejection/withdrawal) for elected Presidents<br />and I strongly believe it will happen.","Ayaan Fazal (55%): While I hate to admit it, I<br />have a strong feeling that the Chiefs will end<br />up winning. This is primarily because the AFC<br />conference is typically the winner in most recent<br />years and that the Chiefs have already won the<br />previous two. To put it in another way, if the<br />Chiefs win this weekend, this current probability<br />will skyrocket. Their potential opponents, if they<br />make it to the Bowl, will be either a rookie led<br />Commanders or the Eagles, a team he has already<br />beaten in the Super Bowl.","Emma Peterson (25%): I say 25% because there are<br />still NFC and AFC championship games that have<br />yet to happen, which means there are still 4 teams<br />left in the running for playing in the Superbowl.<br />I would give them a slight advantage, however they<br />are playing the Bills in the AFC championship and<br />have already lost to them once this season. Not<br />only that, but they are once again predicted to<br />lose to the team, despite having a better record<br />this year. 25% is not only based on winning the<br />Superbowl, but making it to the game in the first<br />place.","Milan Yadav (16%): Historically, it is more common<br />for nominees to withdraw when facing significant<br />opposition or controversy than to be outright<br />rejected by the Senate. Senate confirmation<br />processes often uncover past statements, financial<br />disclosures, or personal conduct that spark<br />controversies as we have seen already with Pam<br />Bondi and Lee Zeldin..... Also, the POTUS election<br />is still very fresh in the government, so it would<br />not be unlikely for senators to factor their party<br />before voting on these nominees. However, the last<br />time a nominee was outright rejected was all the<br />way back in 1989. Recess appointments are also<br />something to factor, which basically bypasses the<br />confirmation hearings process. I say a 16% chance<br />mainly considering some nominees withdrawing<br />already (Gaetz, Chronister)","Rebecca Mcadam (42%): The Chiefs have a very<br />strong winning streak in terms of the Super Bowl.<br />Also according to sports betting and forecasting<br />sources, the Chiefs have around a 31% chance of<br />winning. That being said, they are in the playoffs<br />so the odds of them winning will only increase<br />if they stay in the playoffs, which is why I am<br />giving them more than a 31% chance of winning.","Addisen Kameron (40%): I think there’s a 40%<br />chance the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. Although<br />their game with the Bills is said to be close this<br />weekend I seriously doubt they’ll lose; the Bills<br />have never beat a Mahomes Chiefs in the postseason<br />and they have a few team injuries. However, no<br />team has ever had a threepeat and I think this is<br />the Eagles’ year to win the Super Bowl. They have<br />a tight offense with Saquon Barkley and I think<br />the only thing that could hold them back is if<br />Jalen Hurts doesn't fully recover by game day.","Bailey Mattox (100%): Travis Kelce has Taylor<br />Swift's luck on his side and they have the best<br />win-loss ratio compared to the other teams.","Bailey Mattox (90%): While it is rare for a<br />senate-confirmable nominee to be rejected I think<br />at least one will either be rejected or withdraw,<br />just because there are so many of them.","Joey Khashan (60%): It is very rare that a<br />Predisent’s Senate-confirmable nominee gets<br />rejected by the Senate, especially when the<br />President’s party maintains control of the<br />Senate. However, it is possible that another<br />one of Trump’s nominees will withdraw. Trump<br />had five withdrawals in his first term and could<br />potentially see another in the coming months.","Jenny Qiu (60%): The Kansas City Chiefs have<br />great experience and have won the last two Super<br />Bowls. They have been to the AFC championship 7<br />years in a row. It currently looks like the Chiefs<br />and the Lions are the best teams this season in<br />their respective conferences, so they may be going<br />against each other in the Super Bowl. Against the<br />Lions, the Chiefs have an overall record of 9-6<br />throughout football history.","Hampton Barrineau (35%): I think the Bills have<br />been developing for a long time and frankly I<br />think the Chiefs are bound to slip up eventually.","Sreya Pandyaram (70%): I predict that the Kansas<br />City Chiefs are going to win the Super Bowl, this<br />is a difficult assumption since we have to get<br />through two levers. The chiefs first have to beat<br />the Bills, whom are great competitors. From the<br />post season record against the bills, the chiefs<br />won 4 out of 6 post season games, allowing them<br />at 67% chance of winning. Therefore, even though,<br />the Bills are ahead in overall games won during<br />their dual history, the Chiefs seem to be strong.<br />Assuming that this does not matter and that The<br />Chiefs have already beat the Bills their chance<br />at winning the Super Bowl is still somewhat<br />high, since they have won a previous Super Bowl<br />with the Eagles(2023), if they continue into<br />the Super Bowl, and it is also important to take<br />into account Hurt's injury. And The Commanders<br />record with the Chiefs is 14-24, and the chiefs's<br />experience may rule.","Townsend Turner (40%): The odds of cabinet<br />nominees not being confirmed is generally low,<br />so the odds are usually far below 50%. However,<br />this year the confirmation battle of Pete Hegseth<br />promises to be very close as it is one of the most<br />contentious in recent history. Most importantly,<br />multiple Republicans have opposed him thus far and<br />it only takes a few. That said, it is still not<br />probable that he will not be confirmed due to the<br />partisan nature of politics now. No other nominees<br />seem to be at risk of not being confirmed.<br />Included here is also the incredibly small chance<br />that one of them does something that changes the<br />game and withdraws.","Townsend Turner (30%): There are four teams left<br />in the playoffs and so there is a roughly 25%<br />chance because of the extremely high parity in the<br />league now. However, with the Chiefs’ experience<br />on this stage and team cohesive trends that have<br />lasted all season, they have a small advantage<br />over the other three. Further, Washington has had<br />a very lackluster history and is a Cinderella team<br />by all definitions this year, so their chances are<br />more around 15-20%.","Da In Song (90%): Considering the fact the house<br />is in a Republican majority, it would make sense<br />for me to be more uncertain about Trump's nominees<br />passing the final check. However, two nominees<br />have already withdrawn and Hegseth is facing<br />Republican backlash from his actions as well as<br />Democratic opposition. The likelihood Hegseth<br />gets nominated depends on feminist views of women<br />in the workforce. There are eight republican<br />women senators, and three are needed to stop his<br />confirmation. We have a 37% chance Hegseth will be<br />withdrawn, notwithstanding other nominees, such as<br />Pam Bondi.","Levi Thomas (20%): I have come up with this figure<br />because due to a rule change made in 2013, the<br />Senate can confirm presidential picks with a<br />simple majority vote rather than the standard 2/3<br />majority required for most other actions. Seeing<br />as the Republican Party controls the Senate with<br />a 53 person majority, they can ultimately override<br />any resistance from Democrats if they so choose.<br />The only reason I did not put zero percent odds<br />was the potential for any infighting between Trump<br />and his nominees or unexpected switches in votes<br />from Senate Republicans.","Levi Thomas (40%): The Chiefs have won eleven<br />out of eighteen games this season (regular and<br />postseason) by a single possession. This high<br />amount of single-score victories points to a team<br />that looks better on paper than they do on the<br />field. Furthermore, the Chiefs had one of the<br />easier seasons this year with a regular schedule<br />that did not demand much from the team. That being<br />said, the Chiefs have won the two previous Super<br />Bowls and have an impressive 15-2 record in the<br />regular season. Though I doubt their ability to<br />win, it is not by much.","Andreas Papandreou (10%): Pete Hegseth for Defense<br />Secretary is the only nominee of President Trump<br />who is currently at risk for being rejected by the<br />Senate. For Mr. Hegseth his limited experience,<br />sexual assault allegation, and personal misconduct<br />might have become a road block in a 50-50<br />Senate, but not enough of the 53 Republicans in<br />the current Senate have viewed his actions and<br />experience as a problem. With only Lisa Murkowski<br />and Susan Collins outwardly expressing that they<br />will not vote for him it is overwhelmingly likely<br />that he will be confirmed.","Andreas Papandreou (35%): The Chiefs hardest<br />opponents will be the Bills in the AFC<br />Championship game. The Bills have a much better<br />offense and a defense that played exceptionally<br />well against the Ravens. Josh Allen has also<br />cleared up his interception problem that has<br />haunted him over the past few seasons. Even if the<br />Chiefs beat the Bill, they will then have to play<br />against the Eagles or the Commanders, both of whom<br />are worse than the Chiefs but have players who can<br />change the outcome of a game in Saquon Barkley and<br />Jayden Daniels.","Chloe Cooper (36%): While the Chiefs hold the best<br />record in the NFL at 15-2 and have found ways to<br />win almost all of their games this season, I think<br />they will likely fall short of claiming the Super<br />Bowl title. Even though they are favored in their<br />upcoming game against the Bills, I think the high<br />powered offense of Buffalo led by MVP candidate<br />Josh Allen will ultimately pull through. The Bills<br />also handed Kansas City their first and only loss<br />this season while Patrick Mahomes was starting.<br />Overall the Chiefs have looked unimpressive all<br />year and even if they beat the Bills, I think the<br />Eagles have a very good shot at winning it all,<br />as they are the current favorites according to FOX<br />sports.","Grace Mccann (30%): Based on the current<br />predictions from the rankings I believe the<br />Chiefs will beat the Bills but then fall to<br />the Eagles in the Super Bowl. I think this<br />due to the stellar performance of the eagles<br />especially in their running back and offensive<br />line. I also think the Chiefs 0-38 loss on<br />January 5th is quite concerning. Despite what<br />people say about them not wanting to put their<br />best people out so close to the Super Bowl I<br />still think it is a bad look to be loosing by<br />such large margins. (I did a briefing on this)<br />Frank, Reuben. “Saquon Barkley Shreds Rams<br />Again in Eagles’ Record-Setting Playoff Win.”<br />NBC Sports Philadelphia, January 20, 2025.<br />https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/saquon-barkley-shreds-rams-again-in-eagles-record-setting-playoff-win-2025-nfc-divisional-round/643511/.<br />Ginsbach, Jay. “NFL Playoffs 2025:<br />Conference Championship Odds, Picks<br />and Betting for Commanders-Eagles and<br />Bills-Chiefs.” Forbes, January 23, 2025.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayginsbach/2025/01/23/nfl-playoffs-2025-conference-championship-odds-picks-and-betting-for-commanders-eagles-and-bills-chiefs/.<br />Viera, Tom. “Projected 2025 Super Bowl<br />Matchup: Odds Suggest Most Likely Teams Are<br />Chiefs, Eagles.” USA Today, January 22, 2025.<br />https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/01/22/super-bowl-59-odds-projected-matchup-possibilities/77875699007/.","Pablo Martinez (35%): Some people might expect<br />this to be higher but that's not always the case.<br />In sports, the odds of anyone winning a national<br />title or title in their league are always under<br />the 40% range according to preseason odds. Despite<br />this, many websites like Fox Sports, Sport Pro<br />Reference, and fanduel, had the odds of the<br />Chiefs winning in the 20-30% range. I picked<br />35 not because of what other websites have said<br />but because of how the postseason has played<br />out so far in the NFL. Most of these odds are<br />determined in the pre-season where anything can<br />happen. Now that we have our playoff contenders<br />playing, we can further see what the best odds<br />are for the chief to 3-peat. I would have had<br />this number higher if the teams that were still<br />in the playoffs were different. If teams like<br />the LA Rams, the Buccaneers, the Chargers, or<br />the Steelers found ways to upset the bigger teams<br />in the playoffs, the odds would be higher as<br />the Chiefs would have had a way easier pave to<br />the Super Bowl. On average, the Chiefs have an<br />average 60.4% win rate against teams that had the<br />lowest contention for a Super Bowl. However, it<br />seems the postseason picture has been going to<br />plan as the teams seeded the highest to contend<br />for a Super Bowl are still in the postseason<br />picture despite the number 1 seed Lions's upset<br />loss over the Commanders and the Vikings losing<br />to the Rams. The chief's average win rate between<br />the Bills, chiefs, and ravens (calculated before<br />the divisional round) is around 50% a 10% drop<br />which too many doesn't seem like a lot but 50%<br />is anybody's game and who knows what can happen.<br />Taking the preseason odds into account and how the<br />playoffs have played out. I think 35% is a healthy<br />odd. I'm still new to predicting things correctly<br />but for a team that still needs to face the bills<br />and the winner of an Eagles vs Commanders. On top<br />of that the ability to 3 peat that hasn't happened<br />in the Super Bowl era, who knows what might<br />happen.","Joey Khashan (35%): The Chiefs are a great team,<br />but their upcoming competition is fierce. They<br />have experienced players and an amazing coach, but<br />a difficult list of opponents. They get to play<br />their next game at home which increases their odds<br />of winning, but they have to face Josh Allen and<br />the Bills who are playing exceptionally. These<br />factors coupled with the fact that the Chiefs have<br />not been playing up to expectation make me doubt<br />their ability to win a Super Bowl.","Hampton Barrineau (35%): The Buffalo Bills<br />have been developing their team now for years,<br />with even their stadium being renovated as of<br />late. Their franchise is bound for glory in the<br />near future, and I question if the Chiefs can<br />shoulder the expectations of back to back Super<br />Bowls. That’s not even to mention the Washington<br />Commanders who soundly beat a very strong Lions<br />nor the Eagles who have a Super Bowl Threat most<br />seasons.","Chinelo Ireh (37%): The Kansas City Chiefs<br />have won the past 2 Super Bowl because it is a<br />formidable team. But, I do not think they will win<br />the Super Bowl because it will not win its game<br />against the Buffalo Bills this upcoming weekend.<br />The Bills are projected to win this weekend, which<br />will prevent the Chiefs from advancing further.<br />There is still a chance that the Chiefs could<br />advance to the next round but I do not think it<br />will win because there has been no 3-peats in<br />Super Bowl history. Now will not be the time to<br />start that.","Hampton Barrineau (95%): I predict with 95%<br />confidence that the Trump administration will<br />fail to appoint at least one senate-confirmable<br />nominee. Turnover within the Trump administration<br />was already at historical highs back in his 2016<br />administration, but once again Trump is nominating<br />highly controversial candidates with a lack of<br />skills. Many of Trump’s federal judicial nominees<br />did not pass the Senate due to lack of experience.<br />Now in 2024, we can see a similar scenario with<br />Pete Hegseth. Pete Hegseth is nominated for<br />Secretary of Defense despite only leading about a<br />thousand men during his tour of duty in the Middle<br />East and also having spent the vast majority<br />of his career as a pundit/host on Fox. On Fox,<br />Hegseth regularly made inflammatory comments on<br />the state of the military, attacking the military<br />leadership and rules of engagement on perceived<br />“wokeness”. His reactionary views not only make<br />him enemies in the military’s leadership, but<br />he has attacked many consensus positions like<br />allowing women to serve in active combat roles.<br />Additionally, Hegseth is being dragged brutally<br />through hearings as women from all over his<br />life, including his own mother and sister in-law,<br />have come forward stating that Hegseth regularly<br />abuses women and alcohol. Pete has dismissed<br />these without hesitation, but when asked about<br />his alcoholism, Pete responded stating he wasn’t<br />an alcoholic but he would stop drinking if he got<br />the cabinet position, which is frankly a common<br />sentiment expressed by alcoholics. Additionally,<br />Hegseth is comically unqualified. When asked to<br />name three countries in the ASEAN grouping, he<br />failed to name one correctly. This was on top of<br />many other questions of a similar issue. Moderate<br />Republicans have voted against Trump’s judicial<br />nominees before, notably moderates but also names<br />like Senator Kennedy of Louisiana. Given the Trump<br />administration already had to withdraw Matt Gaetz<br />for being a sex offender, I don’t think they are<br />going to have an easy time with confirmations;<br />Pete too is only one questionable nominee too.<br />Other candidates are similarly bat shit crazy.<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/senators-received-affidavit-containing-new-allegations-pete-hegseth-de-rcna188342<br />https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna187909<br />https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges","Kaitlyn Scoggins (65%): I believe it is<br />relatively likely that one of Trump's nominees<br />for Senate-confirmable positions will be either<br />rejected or withdrawn. RFK Jr. has been highly<br />controversial on both sides of the political<br />spectrum and therefore may face challenges with<br />his confirmation. Additionally, Pete Hegseth<br />is facing allegations of sexual assault and<br />general incompetency that may interfere with his<br />confirmation.","Diane Johnson (35%): A three-peat has never<br />been done in SuperBowl history and from personal<br />experience (being a Georgia fan) I think there is<br />too much pressure (especially for Patrick Mahomes)<br />on this game for the Chiefs to win it. The Chiefs<br />only won their last two SuperBowls during the last<br />few moments of the game and only by a mere few<br />points. This insane luck is less likely to play<br />out for a third year in a row. Furthermore, if the<br />Chiefs play the Eagles again, they played fairly<br />recently and might have a more accurate strategy<br />to win this year.","Elijah Henderson (39%): In the regular season,<br />the Bills were the only team to beat the Chiefs<br />before week 18, in which they rested their<br />starters and lost to the Broncos by 30+. However,<br />Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have a long history<br />together. Josh Allen performs better head-to-head<br />in the regular season, with Mahomes dominating<br />Allen in the post-season. Furthermore, if the<br />Chiefs can overcome the Bills, they will face an<br />opponent in the Super Bowl who they would have a<br />much greater chance of winning against, whether<br />it be the Commanders or Eagles, as many pundits<br />are calling this matchup the real Super Bowl. In<br />any case, this is one of the better Bills teams<br />ever assembled, and they are coming hot off a<br />barn-burner in Buffalo against the Baltimore<br />Ravens, who likely have the best 1-2 punch<br />offensively in this decade (Lamar Jackson and<br />Derrick Henry). If the Bills were able to survive<br />this dynamic duo, I think they can corral Pat<br />Mahomes and the Chiefs.","Wyatt Stevenson (55%): I don't think there will<br />be an instance where another one of the senate<br />nominees will be rejected or withdrawn. While<br />there have been a couple of withdrawals from Matt<br />Gaetz and Chad Chronister, I think due to Trump's<br />fast paced transition into the office, it would<br />be tough for a nominee to back out at this point.<br />Pete Hegseth is still contested because of his<br />past behavior, but I think he will remain staying<br />in the nomination.","Lawton Smith (45%): With their main last obstacle<br />standing in their way , the Chiefs have to play<br />Josh Allen and the red hot bills. No team has ever<br />three peated before in the modern era of the NFL.<br />It will be very hard to get passed Josh Allen,<br />but the Chiefs are the betting favorites to win<br />the Super Bowl as of right now. But with the play<br />style and level of play coming from Mahomes this<br />season i think it is slightly less likely than<br />likely.","Wyatt Stevenson (75%): I do not think the Kansas<br />City Chiefs will win the Superbowl this year.<br />While they have had a ton of success this year<br />in the regular season and postseason, due to<br />the remaining competition, I believe either the<br />Bills or the Eagles/Commanders could pull off an<br />upset. The Chiefs have not had the same offensive<br />production as years past and due to the Bills and<br />Eagles/Commanders success, I believe one of these<br />teams can get the job done this year.","Kaitlyn Scoggins (55%): I believe the Kansas City<br />Chiefs are more likely to win the Super Bowl,<br />but only slightly. Ever since the Falcons lost<br />the Super Bowl in 2017, the team I have rooted<br />for has lost. I really don't like the Chiefs so<br />I feel that this year won't be any different. I<br />also know that the Eagles have the best odds right<br />now (according to NBC and various sportsbooks like<br />DraftKings and FanDuel), but in the past 5 years,<br />these estimates have been wrong 3/5 times.","Elijah Henderson (15%): The Republicans currently<br />control the Senate by 53-47. Looking at the most<br />controversial nominee with the most precarious<br />position, Pete Hegseth, his own sister provided<br />an affidavit that claimed he has regularly<br />abused alcohol and caused his ex-wife to fear<br />for her safety around him. In any case, they<br />still supported him overwhelmingly, with only<br />two defectors in the earlier votes about him. If<br />Hegseth makes it through the Senate, it's hard<br />to imagine anyone else wouldn't be able to. Then<br />again, weird things happen in politics, especially<br />now, so I would say it's overwhelmingly unlikely<br />that any of the nominees don't make it past the<br />Senate.","Raleigh Thomas Smith (70%): I think it is far more<br />likely for one of the nominees to withdraw than<br />to not be confirmed. 4 withdrawals happened under<br />Trump's first term and 1 under Biden. Neither of<br />their appointees had a unsuccessful nomination<br />process the last one being John Tower who was<br />denied the position of Secretary of Defense due to<br />\" claims of drunkenness, womanizing, and ties with<br />defense contractors\" which sounds very similar to<br />Hegseth's critics.","Tiyanah Rowtham (30%): The Kansas City Chiefs have<br />approximately a 30% chance of winning the super<br />bowl. They are among the top contenders but there<br />are other teams, like the Washington Commanders,<br />that are said to have a better chance of winning.<br />On January 26, 2025, the Kansas City Chiefs will<br />go against the Bills at 6:30. The outcome of this<br />game will affect my prediction.","Sarah Joyce (60%): I believe it is more likely<br />than not that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the<br />Super Bowl. Out of the four teams left, the Chiefs<br />have the most wins and least losses. They have<br />also won the Super Bowl for the past two years,<br />which makes me believe that they are a strong<br />contender as they look to win for a third time in<br />a row.","Raleigh Thomas Smith (35%): I will preface this<br />by saying I know little to nothing about the NFL.<br />But looking at previous statistics, I find it<br />very unlikely for the chiefs to win 3 back to back<br />titles. It seems no team has ever won 3 back to<br />back superbowls.","Jacob Weiss (10%): As of Today there are only 14<br />cabinet positions still available by the trump<br />team. If all is equal it is a 50 50 chance. All<br />is not equal a cabinet position hasn't been not<br />confirmed since 89 because most people do drop<br />out if they have issues. This late in the process<br />I see very little chance that anyone drops out.<br />Trump is unique so I still believe there is a 10<br />percent chance.","Emma Allen (30%): Sources, such as ESPN, give the<br />Chiefs the second best odds (+175) out of the four<br />remaining teams left. The Philadelphia Eagles are<br />the consistent favored to win by many sources.<br />Additionally, the Chiefs will have to face the<br />Bills in the AFC championship this Sunday. The<br />Chiefs have already lost once to the Bills in week<br />11 of the regular season. By using statistical<br />evidence from projections of their odds and<br />drawing upon circumstantial elements, such as<br />their difficult path and the highly-rated rosters<br />of their opponents, I find it less likely the<br />Chiefs pull out two straight wins.","James Martin (60%): I think there is a 60%<br />probability the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super<br />Bowl. They have won the super bowl the past two<br />years but it's statistically very challenging<br />to win three in a row. However they have been<br />dominating this season with a 15-2 record. Their<br />upcoming game against the Buffalo Bills should be<br />a good match but the Chiefs have beaten them the<br />past four times in the playoffs so I believe they<br />will win. With the momentum and statistics the<br />Chiefs have been demonstrating for the past three<br />years, they have a pretty good chance at brining<br />home their third Super Bowl win.","Meera Srinivasan (30%): Given the unique nature<br />of President Trump and his cabinet nominees, I<br />think it is more likely that at least some of<br />his nominees will not be confirmed, compared<br />to individuals nominated by other presidents.<br />However, given that a great deal of confirmations<br />happen along partisan lines, I believe it is more<br />likely that the majority-Republican Senate will<br />confirm most, if not all of President Trump’s<br />nominees. It is possible that some nominees may<br />withdraw themselves from consideration, but I<br />believe that is not likely with the remaining<br />nominees.","Niomi Nurse (25%): Most of the Senate that we have<br />now is Republican. With Trump being a Republican<br />President with a predominantly Republican<br />candidate, I feel that it is highly likely that<br />most of his cabinet will pass motions in his<br />favor. For this reason, I think it is unlikely<br />that any of his nominations will be rejected.","Christian Tyler Barr (70%): Other top teams such<br />as the Lions and ravens have been knocked out, I<br />don’t see what’s stopping the chiefs for taking<br />it all the way. Betting odds for the chiefs are at<br />+220 which is the most favorable so far.","Da In Song (80%): The Chiefs have been on a<br />winning streak and there's a 31.2% chance of their<br />victory, but injuries and other weather, sickness,<br />and physical conditions are near impossible to<br />predict.","Meera Srinivasan (60%): I think it is more likely<br />than not that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the<br />Super Bowl this year. The Chiefs have won the last<br />two Super Bowls consecutively, which would make<br />this year’s game their third consecutive victory<br />(if they win). They are also playing against the<br />San Francisco 49ers, a team they faced in Super<br />Bowl LIV and beat, 31-20. I would be somewhat<br />surprised if they do not manage a win this year,<br />but I do not believe it to be out of the realm of<br />possibility.","Niomi Nurse (90%): The Kansas City Chiefs are<br />projected to win the Super Bowl because they have<br />had a great run this season. This season they have<br />had exceptional coaching, great defensive players,<br />and Patrick Mahomes, their star player, has been<br />very consistent.","Isaac Fleischer (35%): Due to the fact that<br />congress is controlled by the Republican Party, it<br />seems unlikely that any of Trumps appointees will<br />fail to be confirmed. The senate has not rejected<br />an appointee since 1989. However, it is certainly<br />possible that another nominee will withdraw.","Aaliyah Diaz (70%): I believe that the Kansas<br />City Chiefs have a strong chance and probability<br />of winning the Super Bowl this year. They are<br />currently one of the top teams in the nation<br />and won last year's game. While I am not too<br />familiar with football, they have a reputation for<br />playing well over the past year and have a great<br />quarterback.","Isaac Fleischer (51%): Out of the four teams<br />remaining. The chiefs have the best chance.<br />Patrick mahomes has had a superb second half<br />of the season. Additionally, despite frequently<br />having less yards than their opponents, the chiefs<br />find ways to win games and have experience playing<br />deep in the playoffs."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,2.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":127.85388127853884},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,2.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will any of<br />President Trump's<br />Senate-confirmable<br />nominees be rejected<br />or withdrawn from<br />consideration?","Will the Kansas City<br />Chiefs win the Super<br />Bowl?"],"tickvals":[1,2],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will any of<br />President Trump's<br />Senate-confirmable<br />nominees be rejected<br />or withdrawn from<br />consideration?","Will the Kansas City<br />Chiefs win the Super<br />Bowl?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"81e0133e3e3":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"81e05208138a":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"81e0133e3e3","visdat":{"81e0133e3e3":["function (y) ","x"],"81e05208138a":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
