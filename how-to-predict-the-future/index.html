ESPN<br />gives UGA a 91.5% chance of winning. Yes; I am<br />copying ESPN for my homework.","Patrick Egan (90%): Using data from the<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration<br />(NOAA), which is apparently part of the Chamber<br />of Commerce, I was able to pull up the low<br />temperatures for every September day for the<br />previous 10 years. In those 10 years, 9/10<br />Septembers had a day where the low was below 62,<br />which the only exception being 2018. There is<br />currently a 3 year streak of having at least one<br />low in the high 50s, and I anticipate that to<br />continue.","Patrick Egan (10%): The chances of breaking a bone<br />are low, especially for people in their 18s-20s.<br />The class is also small so there's a really small<br />chance of this happening. However, I'm not sure<br />if Ornstein counts as being \"in the class\" or<br />not, but with age comes a higher risk of breaking<br />a bone, so I put 10% on the off chance he slips<br />while roller skating or something.","Joseph Kennedy (95%): Georgia football is better<br />than Oregon football. Also the game is in Atlanta<br />and even tho it is a neutral field more UGA fans<br />will most likely come.","Joseph Kennedy (35%): In Athens from the months of<br />August to September, the average low during these<br />months is 67 degrees Fahrenheit. On average, this<br />makes it unlikely that the temperature will drop<br />below 62, but there is a slight chance since it is<br />only a 5 degree difference.","Joseph Kennedy (5%): I think it is very hard to<br />break a bone as most people have never broken a<br />bone in 18 years. I find this very unlikely that<br />someone will break a bone in this class beofre the<br />end of the semester.","Meredith Stevens (90%): 1) 2022 National Champs 2)<br />Have beat Oregon past several years","Meredith Stevens (75%): 1) Georgia weather is very<br />bipolar it has a high chance to hit that at least<br />once 2) We transition into fall making the weather<br />colder","Meredith Stevens (10%): 1) Not a high chance<br />unless it’s some freak accident 2) Bone breaks<br />don’t occur as commonly as they did when we were<br />kids because we are more cautious.","Noah Herndon (90%): Georgia is coming off a<br />National Championship winning season, and I don't<br />see them struggling with any SEC teams in the<br />regular season much less a PAC-12 team. Oregon<br />is the same team that lost to Utah twice in the<br />same season last year. Oregon is also coached by<br />Dan Lanning, the former defensive coordinator of<br />the dawgs. I think it would be a lie to say that<br />Kirby doesn't have him figured out. And finally,<br />while our QB just won a national championship and<br />decided to come back for even more, their QB has<br />lost to the dawgs 3 years in a row at Auburn. I<br />give Oregon a 10% chance to win because any team<br />in college football can win at any time, so it<br />would be unreasonable to give the dawgs a 100% to<br />win.","Noah Herndon (80%): I give it an 80% chance to<br />happen because if we look at past trends, such<br />as last years weather, the temperature dropped<br />below 62 degrees Fahrenheit multiple times before<br />October.","Noah Herndon (25%): I give this question a pretty<br />low probability of happening. Breaking bones<br />aren't really often occurrences. Bones are usually<br />broken through sports, and I highly doubt anyone<br />in this class will be playing sports for UGA which<br />is why I give it a low probability of occurring.","Edward Cox (85%): Uga is a much more talented<br />team through recruitment, their new head coach<br />is our past defensive coordinator. They have lost<br />valuable players due to the transfer portal due to<br />their past coach leaving.","Edward Cox (15%): Geographically, Athens is in a<br />place where the temperature doesn’t drop below 70<br />degrees Fahrenheit until later October. Being in<br />the south of the US, the weather is all over the<br />place but due to the humidity and the sunlight<br />exposure every day, it is very unlikely.","Edward Cox (35%): It is unlikely that someone will<br />break a bone because annually, about 2.8 out of<br />100 people break a bone. since this is half of a<br />year, I took that in half and based it off of how<br />many people are in the class. Then, I considered<br />the possibility that people are going to be drunk<br />which raises your chances to break a bone by 2<br />times. lastly, this is the first time people are<br />living by themselves so they are more likely to do<br />stuff without thinking as much.","Andrew Decker (80%): Although the game is not<br />a home game, the game is still in the state of<br />Georgia so UGA will still have a \"home\" field<br />advantage. UGA also has had better recruiting<br />classes than UofO so I think they have better odds<br />a winning.","Andrew Decker (90%): According to recent data,<br />Athens temperature have reached into the 50's<br />towards the end of September. In the past 10<br />Septembers, 9 out of 10 have reached under 62.","Andrew Decker (10%): Statistics show that 7.7% of<br />people between 15-24 break a bone every year. With<br />that stat in mind I believe the odds are low of<br />someone breaking a bone from now until Nov.","Joe Ornstein (89%): The Vegas moneyline (https://<br />www.vegasinsider.com/college-football/matchups/<br />georgia-vs-oregon/) is currently -909 for a bet on<br />UGA. You can win $100 if you risk $909. That only<br />makes sense for bettors if they think there's at<br />least a 90% chance that UGA will win ( 909 divided<br />by 100 + 909 ). This is consistent with ESPN's<br />model (https://www.si.com/fannation/college/cfb-<br />hq/ncaa-football/georgia-oregon-week-1-college-<br />football-picks-predictions-odds-line-spread)<br />called the \"Power Index\", which predicts a 91.5%<br />chance that UGA will win.","Joe Ornstein (98%): Looking back through<br />the Weather Underground archives (https://<br />www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ga/athens/<br />KAHN/date/2021-9), the temperature at the Ben<br />Epps weather station has dropped below 62 F before<br />September 30 every year this century. But the<br />*number* of days with temperatures below 62 F has<br />been decreasing. It seems extremely unlikely, but<br />not impossible, that we'd break the streak this<br />year.","Joe Ornstein (15.7%): There are roughly seven<br />million broken bones each year in the United<br />States, or an incidence of about 2% of the<br />population per year. A study from England<br />(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2008-01-annual-<br />bone-fracture-percent-previous.html) suggests that<br />the rate of fracture is twice as high for people<br />in the age group we're considering, so let's<br />say 4% per year. That's about 1% per 3 months<br />(September - November). If each member of the 17-<br />person class (including me, but assuming that at<br />least one person never shows up) has a 1% chance<br />of breaking a bone, then the chance that *no one*<br />breaks a bone is 0.99^17, or about 84.3%. The<br />chance that at least one person breaks a bone is<br />100 minus that.","Jeremy Lee (85%): 1. UGA is coming off of a<br />dominant championship season 2. UGA football is<br />the best in the nation","Jeremy Lee (15%): 1. It’s been very hot in GA<br />recently 2. Each year, it’s been getting hotter","Jeremy Lee (30%): 1. A lot of people play sports<br />so there is a good chance someone could break a<br />bone 2. I think that breaking bones isn’t that<br />common as an injury","David Barrero (85%): UGA is the reigning National<br />Champion and only lost one game last year while<br />Oregon lost three of their last five games the<br />previous season. UGA was also ranked #3 in best<br />recruiting classes of 2022 while Oregon was ranked<br />#13.","David Barrero (70%): In 2021, the temperature<br />in Athens fell below 62 degrees Fahrenheit<br />about 5 times during the month of September. The<br />probability is lower this year because of global<br />warming and the rise in the average temperatures<br />every year.","David Barrero (35%): As people reach their young<br />adult stage they are less likely to break a bone<br />because their bone mass is denser. The probability<br />is higher because a lot of students in our class<br />do play sports which increases the chance that<br />someone in the class will break a bone.","Arianna Ycaza (90%): The game is in Atlanta, there<br />will be many more UGA fans than Oregon fans there<br />which will rally up the dawgs.","Arianna Ycaza (40%): I think it will happen early<br />morning or at overnight between now and the end of<br />September, but not soon and not during the day.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): We have a lot of recreational<br />athletes in this class, but I don't believe we<br />have any UGA athletes. Because of this, it is safe<br />to say that we do not have too many people with<br />time to do activities such as sports to risk a<br />bone break.","Hannah Jones (90%): The University of Georgia<br />athletic teams are part of the south-eastern<br />conference (SEC) which is the strongest conference<br />in the nation compared to any other. The<br />University of Georgia also has signed more 5-star<br />recruits than any other football team in the past<br />five years, making them overall stronger than any<br />other team. This leads me to believe UGA will win<br />against Oregon.","Hannah Jones (55%): Georgia weather is highly non-<br />reliable and constantly changing from one end of<br />the spectrum to another. Some days are 85 with<br />others going all the way down to 60. Because of<br />this i believe there is a fair chance that at<br />least one day will fall under 62. Georgia weather<br />also sees a lot of rain, with rainy skies comes<br />lower temperatures. Leading me to believe there is<br />a slight but very possible chance that the weather<br />could fall under 62.","Hannah Jones (20%): It is very rare to see someone<br />on campus with a cast on because they broke a<br />bone. With all the classes at UGA, I find it very<br />unlikely that one of the smallest classes such as<br />ours (around 15-20 people) would have someone with<br />a broken bone. I also think that there may be some<br />sort of injury but not to the extent of breaking.<br />Breaking a bone would mean a serious hit was<br />taken. Leading me to believe there is a very low<br />chance of someone in our class breaking a bone.","Mac Kinnebrew (85%): The spread of this game is<br />-17 in Georgia's favor so they are highly favored.<br />This game is also in Atlanta which is much closer<br />to Athens than Eugene, Oregon, giving Georgia<br />heavy home field advantage.","Mac Kinnebrew (90%): I think this because over<br />this history of weather being recorded here the<br />average low is around 60 in the last week of<br />September. Last year there were around 10 days<br />that the temp dipped below 62 so it is highly<br />likely to happen this year.","Mac Kinnebrew (20%): We have 17 people in our<br />class so I think there is a low chance someone<br />breaks something. I do think there is a chance<br />though because a lot goes on in college and freak<br />accidents do happen.","Ian Driggers (75%): I think that UGA is a better<br />football team that Oregon but I am not 100%<br />confident. Football is a sport and like any sport,<br />anything can happen on any given day.","Ian Driggers (60%): I haven’t lived in athens<br />very long but I think that it will drop below 62°<br />Fahrenheit by September 31st. I think that we will<br />get some rain and it will drop the temperature.","Ian Driggers (20%): I don’t think that anyone<br />in our class will break a bone before the end of<br />class. I think that a lot of kids in our class are<br />active but we do not play many contact sports on<br />the regular so the chances for us to break bones<br />decreases."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.66929133858268,"symbol":"circle","line":{"width":1.88976377952756,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.4,3.6],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.88976377952756,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.2283105022831,"r":7.30593607305936,"b":40.1826484018265,"l":157.077625570776},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.05,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.65296803652968,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.4,3.6],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will someone in the class<br />break a bone before the<br />end of the semester?","Will the temperature<br />in Athens drop below 62<br />degrees Fahrenheit at<br />least once by September<br />31, 2022?","Will UGA beat Oregon in<br />its first football game<br />of the season?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will someone in the class<br />break a bone before the<br />end of the semester?","Will the temperature<br />in Athens drop below 62<br />degrees Fahrenheit at<br />least once by September<br />31, 2022?","Will UGA beat Oregon in<br />its first football game<br />of the season?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.65296803652968,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.6118721461187}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.689497716895}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"46e452caa32":{"x":{},"y":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"46e47bfc7bf8":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"46e452caa32","visdat":{"46e452caa32":["function (y) ","x"],"46e47bfc7bf8":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.2,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
