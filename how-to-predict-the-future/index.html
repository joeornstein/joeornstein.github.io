That said, every game there is<br />some chance of an upset, and those small<br />chances compound over 12 weeks. At the risk of<br />embarrassing myself twice in two years over the<br />same question...","Joe Ornstein (20%): Seems like it would be a bit<br />*too soon* on the heels of 1989 (TV) to announce<br />another re-release. Swiftologists analyzing the<br />Karma music video predict that Reputation (TV)<br />will be released during the solar eclipse on<br />April 8, 2024, and announced two months earlier<br />in February. But the question wording would also<br />be satisfied by a brand new studio album or a live<br />album, and Taylor Swift is *prolific*.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires are only negotiated<br />when *both* parties believe that peace is better<br />than what they could potentially achieve by<br />extending the conflict. And neither party believes<br />that right now. Putin thinks time is on his side:<br />Russian troops can hold their defensive line<br />until Western resolve and support dries up. And<br />the Ukrainian government is steadfastly opposed<br />to any negotiation that surrenders territory.<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/world/europe/ukraine-fight-negotiations.html","Joe Ornstein (90%): In the past 20 years<br />of weather data, it's happened every year<br />except 2009 and 2020. But it's a squeaker;<br />the temperature in Athens usually dips<br />below freezing only a *few days* before<br />Nov 29. This one will be a real nail-biter.<br />https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ga/athens/KAHN","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): Georgia is coming off<br />back-to-back national championships and everyone<br />knows they are the team to beat. This means that<br />everyone will be gunning to beat them and circling<br />the uga game on their calendar as their chance<br />to shock the world. Our schedule is ridiculously<br />easy, and the out-of-conference games are a joke.<br />However, an SEC team, probably either Auburn,<br />Tennessee, or Florida will beat us in a game this<br />year. We will finish the regular season with one<br />loss","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): Taylor is dropping her<br />version of 1989 on October 27th, which means that<br />these songs will be the talk of teenage girls for<br />the next month. Her marketing is impressive and<br />her fanbase's dedication to her is even more so.<br />When this album drops, they will be satisfied for<br />at least a month and will not be clamoring for a<br />new one until at least a month later. Also, she<br />will not want to drop the albums close together<br />because they would drown each other out in the<br />press. Each one needs its own time.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): It appears as if the war<br />is headed to a stalemate, but not an official<br />one. Russia is dug into trenches and is not going<br />anywhere easily due to Putin's stubbornness.<br />However, Ukraine also doesn't have the manpower<br />to move them. I believe this will result in an<br />unofficial ceasefire that neither side officially<br />agrees to.","Ryan Wolkofsky (20%): Looking at last year's<br />weather, the temperature in Athens dropped below<br />32F a decent amount of times. However, none of<br />those came before November 29th. With the planet<br />warming each year, I do not see the temperature<br />getting lower this year than last year. Also, I<br />live in Charlotte, NC, and am familiar with the<br />climate of this region, The temperature tends to<br />get cold around the 2nd or 3rd week of December<br />but can stay in the 50s through New Year's Day.","Victoria Harrill (90%): The past two years they<br />have shown to be undefeated.","Victoria Harrill (85%): Speak Now (TV) just came<br />out, and she spaces them out a couple to a few<br />months apart.","Victoria Harrill (75%): The Wagner Chief was<br />confirmed dead in a plane crash which will damage<br />Russia's military abilities in Ukraine.","Victoria Harrill (35%): It is not common for<br />Georgia to get below freezing before December.","Jacob Fortner (85%): Our schedule is pretty weak<br />this year with our only semi-difficult game being<br />Ole Miss which is at home. As Carson Beck gets<br />more experience, he'll get better thus making us<br />better which is why I gave us an 85% chance to go<br />undefeated in the regular season.","Jacob Fortner (50%): I don't know anything about<br />Taylor Swift so I'm giving it a coin flip as my<br />prediction.","Jacob Fortner (10%): I think the war will only<br />end if there is significant intervening from the<br />western hemisphere in favor of Ukraine, if this<br />does not happen (which I'm not confident in) then<br />I do not think the war will end by the end of the<br />semester.","Jacob Fortner (25%): From how hot it has been the<br />past few years during wintertime and from the heat<br />of this year so far, I am not confident that there<br />will be a point in time before the end of the<br />semester where the temperature in Athens, GA with<br />drop below freezing.","Maggie Fertig (80%): They preformed very well<br />last year so the probability that they will be<br />undefeated again is high. However, there is a new<br />quarterback, so there is still some uncertainty<br />for how the team will perform.","Maggie Fertig (60%): Taylor Swift has been<br />releasing music at a rapid pace this year, already<br />with one new album and a couple re-recordings. I<br />think the odds of her announcing a new album is<br />high. But since she is working on re-recordings,<br />she may be too busy for new stuff.","Maggie Fertig (30%): The crisis has been ongoing<br />for a few months now. The odds that a ceasefire<br />will be reached before Nov 29 is low, especially<br />with tensions rising everyday. However, there is<br />still a slight possibility.","Maggie Fertig (30%): It is very rare that it gets<br />this cold in Athens in November, especially with<br />global warming. However it is possible to get cold<br />at night towards end of November month.","Duy Do (80%): Because we are the champion for 2<br />consecutive years","Duy Do (70%): Because she need a new album for the<br />next year.","Duy Do (30%): Because Ukraine still try to apply<br />to NATO","Duy Do (5%): Because the temperature has not been<br />dropped below 32F for many years","Kang Lee (80%): I believe that UGA has a very<br />solid chance of going undefeated again this<br />season with a low chance of being upturned by an<br />underdog.","Kang Lee (30%): I don't believe that there is a<br />significant enough event between now and Nov 29<br />for her to announce her final album. It'd be more<br />believable for her to announce her final album<br />after the hype around the eras tour dies down<br />and after 2023. I put the probability at 30 as<br />I believe that there may be a small chance that<br />she announces it but has it set for release much<br />further down the line.","Kang Lee (40%): I believe that Russia will pull<br />out of Ukraine before the end of the semester<br />but they will not announce their desire for a<br />ceasefire until 2024. I believe that while Putin<br />is in power a ceasefire will not be called and<br />a coup will take a while to fully take away the<br />authority of Putin.","Kang Lee (10%): As we live in GA based on past<br />weather patterns and current forecasts for the<br />future it s very unlikely that the temperature<br />will drop below freezing unless a flash cold front<br />were to appear out of the blue.","Simryn Patel (90%): we are two time national<br />champions","Simryn Patel (85%): she is on a good track to<br />doing this, she has been releasing one very often","Simryn Patel (30%): it has been a very long war<br />and negotiations are not being created easily","Simryn Patel (15%): It has been very hot this year<br />and later years have not gotten that cold at all","Hita Boddu (85%): UGA Football was undefeated last<br />season.","Hita Boddu (25%): She has an album coming out<br />in late October, so it is highly unlikely she'll<br />release one soon.","Hita Boddu (50%): Political disputes are<br />unpredictable so it could go either way.","Hita Boddu (25%): It usually doesn't get that cold<br />until December / January.","Rease Bauer (90%): I think this because our<br />schedule is pretty easy but i didn't put 100%<br />because there could be a game where our players<br />aren't playing at their best","Rease Bauer (65%): her next rerecorded album<br />comes out early october, so it is possible for<br />an announcement of the next rerecord but not the<br />actual release of it","Rease Bauer (40%): i know nothing about this and<br />haven't been keeping up with the war at all","Rease Bauer (20%): I know nothing about athens<br />weather but from what i have heard it stays mostly<br />warm/cool up until the end of december","Bain Fulcher (95%): We have a pretty easy schedule","Bain Fulcher (45%): 1989 TV will be released in<br />late October, so it is unlikely that she will<br />announce the next one that soon. But, it is Taylor<br />Swift, so maybe.","Bain Fulcher (50%): It is hard to say because it<br />has been going on for a while, which could mean it<br />will end soon, but maybe not.","Bain Fulcher (45%): Considering that it is still<br />90 degrees in September, I doubt it. But, I am not<br />from Georgia, so I don't know the weather patterns<br />here very well.","samiha sarwar (75%): We have a very easy schedule.","samiha sarwar (85%): She has been very consistent<br />with her relases and gave an hint.","samiha sarwar (25%): They have been at war for<br />a while and I don't see the conflict resolving<br />anytime soon.","samiha sarwar (35%): Georgia doesn't typically get<br />that cold until January.","Peyton Murry (70%): Because UGA has already won<br />2 years in a row, it's unlikely for them to win<br />again. However, they've showed that they're still<br />a good team and have an easier schedule","Peyton Murry (70%): It would make sense, but<br />Taylor Swift is unpredictable. She also usually<br />announces album releases a little further apart","Peyton Murry (25%): Russia will not back down.<br />A ceasefire will only happen if other countries<br />intervene. I don't think that'll happen within our<br />semester","Peyton Murry (15%): It is too hot.","Ansley Austin (80%): I think Ole Miss, Florida,<br />or South Carolina will give them a 9-1 regular<br />reason.","Ansley Austin (80%): She recently announced 1989,<br />so Reputation is expected to be announced before<br />then December.","Ansley Austin (20%): I do not know much about<br />Russia vs Ukraine, but I don't think it'll stop<br />soon.","Ansley Austin (30%): Athens is very hot and will<br />not reach freezing by December.","Harini Mohan (75%): Mainly because we were<br />national champions for 2x in a row. But in the<br />individual games, we might lose one.","Harini Mohan (30%): One month isn't really enough<br />time for her to release anything. Especially<br />because 1989 is coming in October.","Harini Mohan (20%): Since there hasn't been any<br />major news about it, I don't think something will<br />come up.","Harini Mohan (25%): Looking at the average lows<br />from previous years, it never really got that<br />cold. Its also getting hotter each year.","Harshini Mohan (85%): We have the same coach and<br />we were undefeated the last two years.","Harshini Mohan (25%): She just released a new<br />release date for one of her rerecordings so she<br />probably won't announce a new one.","Harshini Mohan (30%): Putin is still in power and<br />it probably won't end until he's out.","Harshini Mohan (30%): It has

The Mega Millions is a very elusive<br />prize, that the odds of drawing it is very low.","Maggie Fertig (40%): While two tracks form her<br />previous album hit the No. 1 spot, I think the<br />chances are low that at least one song on this<br />album will hit No. 1 because right now on the<br />charts, vampire is going down and the other<br />highest spot is 39 and going down.","samiha sarwar (35%): While I know time isn't<br />the matter but someone recently won. I think the<br />chances of someone else winning is low.","samiha sarwar (95%): When her album comes out at<br />least one song has hot No. 1. She is a very good<br />artist with a large audience.","Joe Ornstein (63%): Two ways of thinking about<br />this one. On the one hand, if you look back at all<br />the Mega Millions jackpot winners over the past<br />five years, it is *very* rare to see a period of<br />77 days in which there's no winner. If you pick a<br />random 77-day period, there's about an 85% chance<br />that it will contain a jackpot winner. That said,<br />we just had a big >$1 billion jackpot, and ticket<br />sales tend to slum after those big wins, leading<br />to reduced odds of winning. There are about 11<br />million tickets being sold for each drawing,<br />22 drawings left, and 1 in 302 million odds of<br />winning the jackpot. Putting all that together,<br />you get roughly 55% chance of a ticket winning<br />the jackpot before Nov 29, but I'll bump that up<br />a bit since I expect tickets sales to increase the<br />larger the jackpot gets.","Joe Ornstein (80%): \"Will\" is, I think, the key<br />word here. The lead single \"Vampire\" already hit<br />No. 1 before the album released. Will it go back<br />to No 1? Will another track from the album hit No.<br />1? Three from her first record did, and Guts has<br />received a lot of critical acclaim, so I think the<br />odds are good.","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (50%): 50/50 chance<br />because the lottery is an unpredictable event","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (75%): With her first<br />album, \"Driver's License\" hit number one. She<br />has several fans, so it is a high possibility it<br />happens again with her new album by November.","Bain Fulcher (2%): The odds of winning a Mega<br />Millions jackpot is about 1 in 302.6 million. So,<br />it is very unlikely that someone will win between<br />now and November 29.","Bain Fulcher (85%): Her song \"Vampire\" from the<br />album is already number 9 on the list, so there<br />is a good chance that her songs will continue to<br />climb and that at least one will hit No.1.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (85%): It seems likely.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (20%): Her hit songs of this album<br />are not that good.","Hita Boddu (15%): Only 212 jackpots have been won<br />since the game began.","Hita Boddu (100%): Many of her songs from SOUR hit<br />No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100.","Harini Mohan (15%): No one had won a Mega Million<br />jackpot since April 18. It's played in 45 states<br />so the odds are pretty low for someone in Georgia<br />to win.","Harini Mohan (100%): Her new album \"Guts\" has<br />gotten popular on social media handles like<br />TikTok. One of her songs \"Vampire\" is already<br />standing at #9.","Harshini Mohan (40%): The odds of winning that is<br />low.","Harshini Mohan (85%): Her new album is getting<br />alot of attention and she might go on tour.","Rease Bauer (20%): Winning the lottery is rare so<br />a low probability makes the most sense","Rease Bauer (80%): I think a high probability<br />because her last album was a success and her two<br />songs she released as singles before everyone<br />liked","Peyton Murry (10%): It seems to only happen ab 6<br />times on avg per year and it’s already happened 8<br />times this year","Peyton Murry (30%): Needs more clout","Jacob Fortner (40%): These things never result in<br />a winner almost, and when they do it takes forever<br />so I think it happens later, if it happens.","Jacob Fortner (60%): Not a big fan of Olivia<br />Rodrigo but what seems to happen with these<br />up-and-coming artists is that they receive a great<br />deal of hype simply for them because younger. From<br />this I say it's more likely than not.","Ansley Austin (80%): 4 winners won the mega<br />million jackpot on Septermber 12, so there's<br />definitely a good probability.","Ansley Austin (80%): Vampire already has, so I<br />think a song like \"bad idea, right?\" will do the<br />same.","Kang Hyuk Lee (50%): I believe the chance of<br />someone winning the mega millions is a 50 50<br />chance.","Kang Hyuk Lee (20%): There's too many other<br />artists that are contending for top spot and I<br />don't believe Olivia's sophomore album will be<br />popular enough"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.90000000000000002,0.050000000000000003,0.14999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.25,0.40000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.40999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.45000000000000001,0.34999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.90000000000000002],"y":[2.9797789836768063,2.9904356356943027,2.9670051772845909,2.99860261620488,3.0466244709910826,3.0251620021183045,2.9581152798142285,2.9806796380318703,3.0365166305331512,2.9971156126353891,3.0417960761347786,2.9818316927645356,3.0052040638867767,3.0068108579609545,2.9819810391869397,2.9995525046717377,2.9674582175677644],"text":["Jack Whipple (90%): 50% of the winners have been<br />male and %50 have been females, so it's really<br />50/50 but I believe that more women will remain<br />because 4 guys have won in a row, and it's only<br />at 2 females in a row so they more likely going to<br />either match or excede this streak.","Duy Do (5%): Because men are physically stronger<br />than women","Simryn Patel (15%): statistically more men have<br />become survivors","Maggie Fertig (40%): While women do perform well<br />on this show, in the past they have been voted off<br />first.

Men are typically better at<br />physical challenges.","Joe Ornstein (40%): Looking back at the past 15<br />seasons of Survivor (I didn't have the stamina to<br />go farther back than that), the ninth season of<br />the show ends with more women than men 40% of the<br />time.","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (30%): In the past, men<br />have been more likely to win the show. Women have<br />won 17 seasons men have won 26.","Bain Fulcher (40%): Typically, more women than<br />men are voted out in the show. 17 seasons have<br />been won by women, and 26 have been won by men. 14<br />of the past 19 seasons have been won by men. So,<br />there is a chance that these trends will continue,<br />and that there will be more men than women<br />remaining on the show.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (41%): Men have won 22 of the 37<br />seasons.

But, there will be more rain than<br />usual this year because it is an el Niño year, so<br />there is a greater chance than usual.","bain Fulcher (75%): If it has already/almost<br />reached double digits one month in, unfortunately<br />it is likely that it will reach 30 by the end<br />of the semester. I know that several of my hall<br />mates, including myself, have encountered at<br />least one already, and we are on the 8th floor.<br />Also, the number of cockroaches seen is likely to<br />increase as temperatures drop.","samiha sarwar (85%): He has still be very popular<br />amongst the republican party. He receives a lot<br />of support so I wouldn't be shocked if he lead the<br />party again.","samiha sarwar (50%): I can see this going either<br />way. We can get really bad hurricane, but I<br />haven't heard of any really bad ones recently. We<br />are in hurricane season, so I am really sure.","samiha sarwar (100%): Judging by how many I have<br />seen so far, there's not a doubt in my mind that<br />we will hit 30 cockroach counter by November 29.<br />Its very humid inside of Creswell especially the<br />bathroom, and thats where they like to hide out.","Rease Bauer (85%): After Biden, I think Trump<br />built up enough support behind him with the insane<br />contrast from Biden, that he or DeSantis will be<br />in the lead for the conservative party.","Rease Bauer (65%): I think this because in the<br />past almost every year we have had a bad hurricane<br />at least once.","Rease Bauer (100%): creswell is disgusting and the<br />roaches love it","Maggie Fertig (70%): Based on his popularity<br />amongst the republican party, it is likely he will<br />lead the race by Nov 29. According to the average<br />published by 538, his lead has increased steadily<br />since the beginning of this year (43 to 55%) while<br />his opponents have mostly decreased.","Maggie Fertig (40%): Only have been 27 documented<br />since 1850s. It is doubtful that one will occur<br />this year however not impossible, as there was a<br />category 4 in Sept of 2022.","Maggie Fertig (65%): The cockroach count was at<br />9 over an approximate 3 week time period. At this<br />rate, the cockroach count should reach 30 by the<br />beginning of Nov. However, I suspect the counters<br />will loose motivation and forget to record the<br />counts.","Simryn Patel (60%): he has a grip on GOP voters","Simryn Patel (75%): global warming","Simryn Patel (85%): they have already reached like<br />15","Jacob Fortner (55%): Yes, Trump is very popular,<br />but Ron Desantis is on the come up. I think the<br />main problem people have with Trump is that he<br />isn't exactly the nicest individual, but he does<br />get things done but Desantis is seen by people<br />as a better individual. (I know nothing about<br />politics)","Jacob Fortner (18%): There have only been 32<br />category 4 or higher hurricanes in the last 173<br />years. Statistically, that creates an 18% change<br />per year.","Jacob Fortner (75%): If I recall correctly, we<br />said there was already 15 seen by this point and<br />we are only a month into the semester. With still<br />a couple months before November 29th, I think it<br />is a high probability that 30 will be reached or<br />even surpassed.","Tori Harrill (85%): Trump is significantly ahead<br />of any other candidate. His percentage runs at<br />55.8% while other candidates are significantly<br />lower at statistics such as 14.6% (DeSantis), 7.8%<br />(Ramaswamy), 6.4% (Haley), 4.8% (Pence)","Tori Harrill (35%): Only four category 5<br />hurricanes have hit mainland US ever, so it is<br />a lower possibility this happens even during<br />hurricane season","Tori Harrill (95%): Encounters with residents of<br />Creswell have already seen several roaches. There<br />is a high probability there will be more sightings<br />before the end of the semester, so a count of 30<br />seems likely.","Jack Whipple (100%): I feel that the majority of<br />the republican party is in favor of Trump as they<br />are upset that he was not able to be president<br />last election and want him to try again this time.","Jack Whipple (80%): There is almost alwasy a<br />hurrican that hits the U.S.","Jack Whipple (90%): Creswell is known for not<br />being clean and sanitary so I think this is very<br />likely.","Harini Mohan (85%): Trump's highest average as<br />of now is 59%. That is far higher than the other<br />candidates. Also, as a previous president and<br />lots of experience, he seems to have a popular<br />advantage.","Harini Mohan (40%): If there were any major<br />hurricanes, they should have hit by now. As we get<br />closer to December, it is less likely for one to<br />hit.","Harini Mohan (85%): There has already been so many<br />cockroaches. Also, when the weather gets colder,<br />cockroaches find their way into cracks, screens,<br />pipes, etc.","Peyton Murry (45%): He was just in jail! I don't<br />think he's a good candidate; however, I didn't<br />think he was a good candidate in 2016, yet, here<br />we are","Peyton Murry (40%): I'm thinking it'll diminish to<br />a category 3 if it hits mainland","Peyton Murry (60%): THERE ARE TOO MANY<br />COCKROACHES. Also, I apologize that I have<br />submitted all of my recent questions late. I've<br />had the issue of consistently forgetting that the<br />answers to the questions are due the day BEFORE<br />class, and not the day OF class. I will do better","Joe Ornstein (95%): I mean, he's 77 years old so<br />mortality risk is non-zero, but aside from that<br />his lead is so dominant, and name recognition so<br />powerful compared to the other candidates, that<br />there's little chance of his lead slipping before<br />the first primary in January.","Joe Ornstein (10%): It's only happened twice in<br />the past 23 years (Ian in 2022 and Michael in<br />2018). That suggests a base rate of 8%, but I'll<br />bump it up to 10% to reflect the lengthening of<br />hurricane season during this period.","Joe Ornstein (25%): To reach 30, the residents<br />of Creswell's 2nd floor would need to continue<br />reporting roach sightings over the next 10 weeks<br />at roughly the same rate as they did for the first<br />5 weeks. I expect it is more likely that the rate<br />will decrease as the weather cools and residents<br />become less diligent about reporting sightings on<br />the counter. There's a chance that someone will<br />manipulate the counter, sure, but I get good vibes<br />from Samiha and don't think it's likely.","Ryan Wolkofsky (70%): The biggest challenger,<br />DeSantis is getting little to no press.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): These events are pretty<br />uncommon later in the year","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): The more people complain<br />about cockroaches, the more exterminators will be<br />on the floor, fighting them.","Harshini Mohan (80%): He was the previous<br />president, and he has a large number of people who<br />want him to run again.","Harshini Mohan (55%): Hurricanes usually happen<br />during warmer/humid months.","Harshini Mohan (75%): There has already been a lot<br />of cockroaches, and as it gets colder, there will<br />probably be more.","Ansley Austin (62%): GOP primary voters should get<br />him many votes.","Ansley Austin (55%): Hurricane season should last<br />until November 30, so it's pretty likely.","Ansley Austin (75%): At this rate, only a month<br />into school, it's very likely it will reach 30<br />especially with the cold months."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.46999999999999997,0.73999999999999999,0.70999999999999996],"y":[1.0454790609888733,1.9575370588805527,2.956127450079657],"text":["Class

Is he willing to do this to avoid<br />a shutdown? It's a small chance, but a chance.<br />Most of the congressional Republican leadership<br />have lost their appetite for shutdowns. Prediction<br />markets currently price it at 75%.","Joe Ornstein (55%): The moneyline for a USA win<br />is -120 right now.

But<br />most likely in the high 3.9s.","Ansley Austin (15%): I did not know this movie<br />was coming out, and I really don't think it'll<br />surpass the opening weekend of Catching Fire ($158<br />million).","Ansley Austin (90%): I think she'll win since she<br />was appointed and and serves in an interim role<br />now.","Harini Mohan (30%): The average in Georgia is<br />3.20, I don't think anything substantial will<br />happen to the economy for the prices to go up that<br />much.","Harini Mohan (45%): It'll probably be famous but<br />neither Peeta or Katniss are going to be in it so<br />it just depends.","Harini Mohan (60%): I think she has good<br />experience and a fair shot of winning.","Harshini Mohan (70%): Russia and Ukraines war is<br />continuing which pressures Saudi Arabia to cut<br />production.","Harshini Mohan (35%): The movies gross is<br />decreasing with each one that gets released.","Harshini Mohan (75%): She has a good work ethic<br />and has contributed in many ways to the community.","Hita Boddu (80%): The current gas prices is at<br />$3.93 which is very close to $4.","Hita Boddu (50%): \"The Ballad of Songbirds &<br />Snakes\" could top the charts for 2023 but maybe<br />not compared to the Hunger Games movies because<br />the Hunger Games movies were very popular when<br />they came out and the excitement around them has<br />fizzled away.","Hita Boddu (65%): She currently serves in an<br />interim role at the Athens-Clarke County clerk of<br />court.","Maggie Fertig (65%): Gas prices have been hovering<br />by 4 for the past 3 months and has steadily been<br />getting closer.","Maggie Fertig (70%): All of the movies have had<br />high grossing opening weekends, but especially<br />since this movie has been long awaited and is a<br />sequel I predict it will have the highest of the<br />series.","Maggie Fertig (80%): It seems like she is favored<br />to win, as she has worked closely with her<br />predecessor and is in the interim role right now.","Tori Harrill (50%): I feel like gas prices could<br />be reaching a peak and could start to decline or<br />they could increase. I'm not really sure.","Tori Harrill (40%): The original hunger games made<br />694.4 million. Because this hunger games isn't<br />so much of the original story, I feel less people<br />will want to see it","Tori Harrill (75%): I'm not up to date on local<br />politics, but I feel Zarate is seen and liked<br />within Athens and seems to be receiving more media<br />attention with this election.","Ryan Wolkofsky (80%): The Middle East is exploding<br />in conflict right now. This will causes prices to<br />continue to rise.","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): The Hunger Games has lost<br />popularity since it first came out","Ryan Wolkofsky (80%): She has a huge advantage<br />being the interim.","Jack Whipple (90%): Gas has been getting very<br />expensive","Jack Whipple (90%): Everyone is hype for a new<br />Hunger Games movie","Jack Whipple (80%): Im not too sure personaly,<br />but based on stuff I have read she seems pretty<br />popular","Bain Fulcher (50%): some action is being taken to<br />reduce gas prices, but i'm not confident that it<br />will lower them that quickly.","Bain Fulcher (40%): i feel like less people will<br />see the new one because it is a prequel, so it is<br />a lot of new characters, so people will not be as<br />excited to see it. also, they may want to wait and<br />see what reviews the movie gets before they go see<br />it themselves.","Bain Fulcher (75%): she filled in for the previous<br />clerk, so she got to know and wok with the other<br />clerks. this will increase her credibility, so she<br />will likely be elected.","Joe Ornstein (45%): Markets for gasoline<br />futures suggest that investors think the price<br />will decline between now and December. I'm not<br />tremendously confident in this forecast, as it's<br />unclear whether renewed conflict in the Middle<br />East will cause supply disruptions. The spot price<br />for a barrel of Brent crude has gone up a few<br />dollars since the war in Gaza began last week.","Joe Ornstein (15%): The highest opening weekend<br />for a Hunger Games film is $158 million, and<br />that happened 10 years ago. For Songbirds and<br />Snakes to beat that, it would have to exceed the<br />opening weekend box office for Barbie, which had<br />significantly more buzz. I don't see it happening.","Joe Ornstein (90%): She's an incumbent Democrat in<br />an off-cycle special election against a challenger<br />who declined to include his party ID on the<br />ballot. She's been endorsed by the mayor and much<br />of the local media. Seems like a slam dunk, but<br />low voter turnout means that surprising things can<br />happen.","Rease Bauer (60%): With the trend of how the<br />economy is going i doubt gas prices with lower","Rease Bauer (45%): I havent even heard the news of<br />this new movie so unless they do more advertising<br />i dont think it will have as great of an opening<br />compared the the barbie movie that was advertised<br />for months to get people excited to see the movie","Rease Bauer (45%): im not very optimistic in<br />this but there is still a possiblity of her being<br />elected","Kang Lee (30%): I believe it is unlikely with the<br />way gas prices are looking","Kang Lee (40%): I believe it's up in the air but<br />I'm leaning towards it not","Kang Lee (60%): I believe it is likely.","Peyton Murry (55%): The Israeli-Hamas conflict","Peyton Murry (40%): I haven't seen much hype<br />around it. The Barbie movie has also done very<br />well. I also think the Era's tour movie could top<br />it","Peyton Murry (70%): She's being backed by the<br />former ACC clerk of courts, so I think that<br />definitely helps her. Moreover, she's been acting<br />as ACC clerk of courts (I believe), and if she's<br />been doing a good job, I think she has a great<br />shot."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.70999999999999996,0.45000000000000001,0.53000000000000003],"y":[0.97884719646535812,2.9725856217555702,1.9500498420558869],"text":["Class Average (71%)","Class Average (45%)","Class Average (53%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(TRUE,NA)","legendgroup":"(TRUE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Elisa Zarate will win the<br />ACC special election for<br />Clerk of Superior Court.","The average price that<br />US consumers pay for a<br />gallon of gasoline will<br />be greater than $4 at the<br />end of the semester (Nov<br />29).","The Ballad of Songbirds<br />& Snakes will have the<br />highest grossing opening<br />weekend of any Hunger<br />Games movie."],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Elisa Zarate will win the<br />ACC special election for<br />Clerk of Superior Court.","The average price that<br />US consumers pay for a<br />gallon of gasoline will<br />be greater than $4 at the<br />end of the semester (Nov<br />29).","The Ballad of Songbirds<br />& Snakes will have the<br />highest grossing opening<br />weekend of any Hunger<br />Games movie."],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"4f587b695b28":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"4f583a9c3a0d":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"4f587b695b28","visdat":{"4f587b695b28":["function (y) ","x"],"4f583a9c3a0d":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

However, in this time, they play<br />nobody of note. Their schedule is ridiculously<br />easy with no ranked opponents, which is a big<br />indicator of whether or not you are ranked.<br />Teams across the country make their out of<br />coout-of-conferencenference schedules easy to<br />start the year so they can warm up.

The<br />US does like getting involved in conflict, so I<br />could see it going any way.","Tori Harrill (45%): I don't think Barbie will<br />be the most popular. I think a lot of people may<br />dress up but it won't be the most popular.","Tori Harrill (65%): I don't know that much about<br />our basketball team here, but they made the rank<br />last year.","Tori Harrill (85%): The U.S has just sent several<br />more troops closer to Israel, and have sent out<br />deployment preparation orders to others to get<br />them ready.","Harshini Mohan (65%): Barbie has gained a lot of<br />popularity because of the movie.","Harshini Mohan (40%): Georgia hasn't won an NCAA<br />game since 2002 and they've made it to the NCAA<br />just 3 times after Herrick left in 2003.","Harshini Mohan (45%): Kirby, the National Security<br />Council spokesman, said there are no active<br />plans or intentions to send U.S. troops to join a<br />potential ground war in Israel and Gaza.","Harini Mohan (65%): Because of the new movie, a<br />lot of girls might dress up as Barbie. But it's<br />not everyones favorite and people might prefer<br />other costumes.","Harini Mohan (40%): UGA has never really been<br />ranked that high and there are better teams","Harini Mohan (50%): It depends on if Biden sends<br />troops to Israel. If he does it'll be more likely<br />for something to happen and we get drawn into<br />active conflict.","Bain Fulcher (80%): it isn't on the list, but I<br />bet that it will be very popular this year because<br />it is relatively easy and can be a solo, group, or<br />partner costume.","Bain Fulcher (35%): We're not even receiving<br />any votes according to the AP Poll, so I'm not<br />optimistic.","Bain Fulcher (45%): The US has been sending<br />support to Israel and I think there is a chance<br />that we will get involved if other countries do,<br />but I think there is a good chance that we will<br />not be in active conflict with a Palestinian<br />militant group.","Jacob Fortner (55%): It's one of the top movies<br />this year and there's already been enough barbie<br />costumes in the years prior.","Jacob Fortner (15%): They're not a traditional<br />powerhouse and they play in a tough conference.","Jacob Fortner (99%): This is literally what we do,<br />gotta clutch up fr fr","Joe Ornstein (80%): Google Trends is an imprecise<br />way to gauge costume popularity, but as of October<br />17, \"Barbie costume\" is the most popular web<br />search out of any \"X costume\" search string. It<br />seems unlikely to be toppled by a new pop culture<br />phenomenon by the end of the month (sorry Taylor,<br />\"Taylor Swift costume\" has less than half the<br />search volume right now).","Joe Ornstein (5%): UGA basketball ended last<br />season with a NET ranking of 157 (out of 363),<br />based on a pretty disappointing 16-16 record. The<br />season before that it was at 152. Since the NET<br />ratings are pretty strongly correlated with the<br />AP poll, it would be pretty improbable to make<br />the top 25 in one season. Looking back at the past<br />six seasons of Men's Basketball rankings, Georgia<br />hasn't made it to the top 25 once.","Joe Ornstein (25%): As of writing, the US Navy has<br />deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern<br />Mediterranean, ostensibly to deter Hezbollah<br />and other regional actors from taking this<br />opportunity to attack Israel. But it's unclear<br />what exactly this threat amounts to. The US does<br />not have a mutual defense pact with Israel, and<br />would not be obligated to intervene if Hezbollah<br />were to escalate its attacks on Israel. The US<br />military would only become actively involved in<br />the conflict if its personnel were attacked (an<br />outcome that Hezbollah leadership will be keen to<br />avoid) or if Iran intervenes directly (unlikely).","Peyton Murry (70%): Barbie was already a popular<br />costume before this year. Now, because of the<br />movie's popularity, I think it'll be even more<br />popular.","Peyton Murry (40%): It seems as if they haven't<br />done particularly well the past few years.<br />Moreover, I looked at a few people on their<br />roster, and it doesn't seem like they're the best<br />players out there.","Peyton Murry (45%): This is such a loaded<br />question. While President Biden has condemned the<br />terrorist attacks against Israel, he's also stated<br />that it is not okay to take these attacks as an<br />opportunity to be Islamaphobic. This shows that<br />this is a delicate conflict, which makes it hard<br />for an outside force to just step in. Moreover,<br />Biden said that at this moment, he doesn't feel<br />the need for the US military to engage in the war,<br />because, \"Israel has one of the finest fighting<br />forces\" (60 Minutes interview). Along with this,<br />the US is currently sending war materials to<br />Israel, which stands in place of our troops.<br />However, the US is literally known for stepping<br />in when difficult conflicts like this arise, and<br />many are calling for America to do so. This puts<br />a large social pressure on America, but at this<br />point, I don't think they'll succumb to it. From<br />now until the end of November, I don't think<br />American troops will physically engage in the<br />conflict.

If I'm reading this<br />correctly, last year, UGA didn't beat the spread.<br />And, it seems that UF might be better this year?<br />So, perhaps it'll be under again.","Peyton Murry (35%): The forecast says that the<br />coldest periods this semester will be in December.<br />As much as I want it to happen, I don't think it<br />will.","Peyton Murry (70%): Predictions show that they<br />should raise interest rates at least a little bit<br />this year.","Maggie Fertig (60%): I dont know much about<br />spreads, but the odds that UGA wins is high","Maggie Fertig (30%): I think it will get cold, but<br />the odds that it will snow is low","Maggie Fertig (30%): Two websites upon initial<br />research says the raise of rates is unlikely, as<br />the Fed is optimistic that it is not needed.","Ansley Austin (65%): The line is pretty big at a<br />14.5 favor, but I think Beat Week will motivate<br />them to win by more on Saturday.","Ansley Austin (15%): I do think it will get below<br />freezing, but I don't think it'll snow before<br />December.","Ansley Austin (20%): The Fed expects that they<br />will choose to hold interest rates steady at the<br />November meeting. Rates may increase in December,<br />though.","Bain Fulcher (70%): we killed kentucky, who beat<br />florida, but we won’t have Brock so we may not<br />beat them by as much.","Bain Fulcher (75%): it gets pretty cold in the<br />mornings, so i wouldn’t be surprised if we got a<br />little one morning.","Bain Fulcher (40%): it could honestly go either<br />way, but if there’s a chance that the US will go<br />into a recession soon, then they wouldn’t raise<br />interest rates now because interest rates fall<br />during a recession.","Joe Ornstein (50%): Vegas oddsmakers set the<br />spread to equalize the amount of money coming in<br />on both sides of the bet, and historically, the<br />spread is well-calibrated (50% of the time the<br />team covers, 50% of the time it doesn't). So far<br />this season, Georgia has had a 2-5 record against<br />the spread, but that past performance is not,<br />in my view, sufficient reason to think they'll<br />fail to cover in the Florida game, because the<br />oddsmakers adjust the spread downward in response<br />to that sort of information. Case in point, Brock<br />Bowers is out with an injury, and the spread went<br />down to 14.5 in response.","Joe Ornstein (2%): I may be reading the NOAA data<br />wrong, so I'll give it more than 0%, but there<br />hasn't been a single November day in the past 8<br />years when a Clarke County weather station has<br />recorded snowfall. Heck, there's hardly been<br />a weather station in *all of Georgia* that's<br />recorded more than trace amounts of snow in<br />November during this period.","Joe Ornstein (1%): Members of the FOMC have made<br />pretty dovish comments in recent weeks, strongly<br />suggesting that they plan to keep rates where they<br />are. Forecasters at investment banks like Goldman<br />Sachs expect the FOMC to hold rates steady.<br />And the CME FedWatch Tool estimates a 99.2%<br />probability that rates will hold steady, based<br />on the price of futures contracts on the Chicago<br />Mercantile Exchange.
