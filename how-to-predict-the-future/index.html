ESPN<br />gives UGA a 91.5% chance of winning.<br />Yes; I am copying ESPN for my homework.","Patrick Egan (90%): Using data from<br />the National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br />Administration (NOAA), which is<br />apparently part of the Chamber of<br />Commerce, I was able to pull up the low<br />temperatures for every September day<br />for the previous 10 years. In those 10<br />years, 9/10 Septembers had a day where<br />the low was below 62, which the only<br />exception being 2018. There is currently<br />a 3 year streak of having at least one<br />low in the high 50s, and I anticipate<br />that to continue.","Patrick Egan (10%): The chances of<br />breaking a bone are low, especially for<br />people in their 18s-20s. The class is<br />also small so there's a really small<br />chance of this happening. However, I'm<br />not sure if Ornstein counts as being \"in<br />the class\" or not, but with age comes<br />a higher risk of breaking a bone, so I<br />put 10% on the off chance he slips while<br />roller skating or something.","Joseph Kennedy (95%): Georgia football<br />is better than Oregon football. Also the<br />game is in Atlanta and even tho it is<br />a neutral field more UGA fans will most<br />likely come.","Joseph Kennedy (35%): In Athens from<br />the months of August to September, the<br />average low during these months is 67<br />degrees Fahrenheit. On average, this<br />makes it unlikely that the temperature<br />will drop below 62, but there is a<br />slight chance since it is only a 5<br />degree difference.","Joseph Kennedy (5%): I think it is very<br />hard to break a bone as most people have<br />never broken a bone in 18 years. I find<br />this very unlikely that someone will<br />break a bone in this class beofre the<br />end of the semester.","Meredith Stevens (90%): 1) 2022 National<br />Champs 2) Have beat Oregon past several<br />years","Meredith Stevens (75%): 1) Georgia<br />weather is very bipolar it has a high<br />chance to hit that at least once 2) We<br />transition into fall making the weather<br />colder","Meredith Stevens (10%): 1) Not a high<br />chance unless it’s some freak accident<br />2) Bone breaks don’t occur as commonly<br />as they did when we were kids because we<br />are more cautious.","Noah Herndon (90%): Georgia is coming<br />off a National Championship winning<br />season, and I don't see them struggling<br />with any SEC teams in the regular season<br />much less a PAC-12 team. Oregon is the<br />same team that lost to Utah twice in<br />the same season last year. Oregon is<br />also coached by Dan Lanning, the former<br />defensive coordinator of the dawgs.<br />I think it would be a lie to say that<br />Kirby doesn't have him figured out.<br />And finally, while our QB just won a<br />national championship and decided to<br />come back for even more, their QB has<br />lost to the dawgs 3 years in a row at<br />Auburn. I give Oregon a 10% chance to<br />win because any team in college football<br />can win at any time, so it would be<br />unreasonable to give the dawgs a 100% to<br />win.","Noah Herndon (80%): I give it an 80%<br />chance to happen because if we look at<br />past trends, such as last years weather,<br />the temperature dropped below 62<br />degrees Fahrenheit multiple times before<br />October.","Noah Herndon (25%): I give this question<br />a pretty low probability of happening.<br />Breaking bones aren't really often<br />occurrences. Bones are usually broken<br />through sports, and I highly doubt<br />anyone in this class will be playing<br />sports for UGA which is why I give it a<br />low probability of occurring.","Edward Cox (85%): Uga is a much more<br />talented team through recruitment, their<br />new head coach is our past defensive<br />coordinator. They have lost valuable<br />players due to the transfer portal due<br />to their past coach leaving.","Edward Cox (15%): Geographically, Athens<br />is in a place where the temperature<br />doesn’t drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit<br />until later October. Being in the south<br />of the US, the weather is all over the<br />place but due to the humidity and the<br />sunlight exposure every day, it is very<br />unlikely.","Edward Cox (35%): It is unlikely that<br />someone will break a bone because<br />annually, about 2.8 out of 100 people<br />break a bone. since this is half of a<br />year, I took that in half and based it<br />off of how many people are in the class.<br />Then, I considered the possibility<br />that people are going to be drunk which<br />raises your chances to break a bone by<br />2 times. lastly, this is the first time<br />people are living by themselves so they<br />are more likely to do stuff without<br />thinking as much.","Andrew Decker (80%): Although the game<br />is not a home game, the game is still in<br />the state of Georgia so UGA will still<br />have a \"home\" field advantage. UGA also<br />has had better recruiting classes than<br />UofO so I think they have better odds a<br />winning.","Andrew Decker (90%): According to<br />recent data, Athens temperature have<br />reached into the 50's towards the end of<br />September. In the past 10 Septembers, 9<br />out of 10 have reached under 62.","Andrew Decker (10%): Statistics show<br />that 7.7% of people between 15-24 break<br />a bone every year. With that stat in<br />mind I believe the odds are low of<br />someone breaking a bone from now until<br />Nov.","Joe Ornstein (89%): The Vegas moneyline<br />(https://www.vegasinsider.com/college-<br />football/matchups/georgia-vs-oregon/)<br />is currently -909 for a bet on UGA.<br />You can win $100 if you risk $909. That<br />only makes sense for bettors if they<br />think there's at least a 90% chance<br />that UGA will win ( 909 divided by 100<br />+ 909 ). This is consistent with ESPN's<br />model (https://www.si.com/fannation/<br />college/cfb-hq/ncaa-football/georgia-<br />oregon-week-1-college-football-picks-<br />predictions-odds-line-spread) called the<br />\"Power Index\", which predicts a 91.5%<br />chance that UGA will win.","Joe Ornstein (98%): Looking back<br />through the Weather Underground<br />archives (https://www.wunderground.com/<br />history/monthly/us/ga/athens/KAHN/date/<br />2021-9), the temperature at the Ben<br />Epps weather station has dropped below<br />62 F before September 30 every year<br />this century. But the *number* of days<br />with temperatures below 62 F has been<br />decreasing. It seems extremely unlikely,<br />but not impossible, that we'd break the<br />streak this year.","Joe Ornstein (15.7%): There are roughly<br />seven million broken bones each year<br />in the United States, or an incidence<br />of about 2% of the population per<br />year. A study from England (https://<br />medicalxpress.com/news/2008-01-annual-<br />bone-fracture-percent-previous.html)<br />suggests that the rate of fracture is<br />twice as high for people in the age<br />group we're considering, so let's say 4%<br />per year. That's about 1% per 3 months<br />(September - November). If each member<br />of the 17-person class (including me,<br />but assuming that at least one person<br />never shows up) has a 1% chance of<br />breaking a bone, then the chance that<br />*no one* breaks a bone is 0.99^17, or<br />about 84.3%. The chance that at least<br />one person breaks a bone is 100 minus<br />that.","Jeremy Lee (85%): 1. UGA is coming off<br />of a dominant championship season 2. UGA<br />football is the best in the nation","Jeremy Lee (15%): 1. It’s been very hot<br />in GA recently 2. Each year, it’s been<br />getting hotter","Jeremy Lee (30%): 1. A lot of people<br />play sports so there is a good chance<br />someone could break a bone 2. I think<br />that breaking bones isn’t that common as<br />an injury","David Barrero (NA%): UGA is the reigning<br />National Champion and only lost one<br />game last year while Oregon lost three<br />of their last five games the previous<br />season. UGA was also ranked #3 in best<br />recruiting classes of 2022 while Oregon<br />was ranked #13.","David Barrero (70%): In 2021, the<br />temperature in Athens fell below 62<br />degrees Fahrenheit about 5 times during<br />the month of September. The probability<br />is lower this year because of global<br />warming and the rise in the average<br />temperatures every year.","David Barrero (35%): As people reach<br />their young adult stage they are less<br />likely to break a bone because their<br />bone mass is denser. The probability is<br />higher because a lot of students in our<br />class do play sports which increases the<br />chance that someone in the class will<br />break a bone.","audrey vaughan (NA%): UGA is better then<br />Oregon","audrey vaughan (NA%): I feel like the<br />temp typically starts to drop in sept so<br />it would make sense for it to get to 62","audrey vaughan (NA%): I feel like I<br />don't see many students with broken<br />bones walking around campus, and because<br />we have a pretty small class I don't<br />think the chance of this happening is<br />very likely.","Arianna Ycaza (90%): The game is in<br />Atlanta, there will be many more UGA<br />fans than Oregon fans there which will<br />rally up the dawgs.","Arianna Ycaza (40%): I think it will<br />happen early morning or at overnight<br />between now and the end of September,<br />but not soon and not during the day.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): We have a lot of<br />recreational athletes in this class,<br />but I don't believe we have any UGA<br />athletes. Because of this, it is safe to<br />say that we do not have too many people<br />with time to do activities such as<br />sports to risk a bone break.","Hannah Jones (90%): The University of<br />Georgia athletic teams are part of the<br />south-eastern conference (SEC) which is<br />the strongest conference in the nation<br />compared to any other. The University<br />of Georgia also has signed more 5-star<br />recruits than any other football team in<br />the past five years, making them overall<br />stronger than any other team. This<br />leads me to believe UGA will win against<br />Oregon.","Hannah Jones (55%): Georgia weather<br />is highly non-reliable and constantly<br />changing from one end of the spectrum<br />to another. Some days are 85 with others<br />going all the way down to 60. Because<br />of this i believe there is a fair chance<br />that at least one day will fall under<br />62. Georgia weather also sees a lot<br />of rain, with rainy skies comes lower<br />temperatures. Leading me to believe<br />there is a slight but very possible<br />chance that the weather could fall under<br />62.","Hannah Jones (20%): It is very rare to<br />see someone on campus with a cast on<br />because they broke a bone. With all the<br />classes at UGA, I find it very unlikely<br />that one of the smallest classes such<br />as ours (around 15-20 people) would have<br />someone with a broken bone. I also think<br />that there may be some sort of injury<br />but not to the extent of breaking.<br />Breaking a bone would mean a serious hit<br />was taken. Leading me to believe there<br />is a very low chance of someone in our<br />class breaking a bone.","Mac Kinnebrew (85%): The spread of this<br />game is -17 in Georgia's favor so they<br />are highly favored. This game is also in<br />Atlanta which is much closer to Athens<br />than Eugene, Oregon, giving Georgia<br />heavy home field advantage.","Mac Kinnebrew (90%): I think this<br />because over this history of weather<br />being recorded here the average low is<br />around 60 in the last week of September.<br />Last year there were around 10 days that<br />the temp dipped below 62 so it is highly<br />likely to happen this year.","Mac Kinnebrew (20%): We have 17 people<br />in our class so I think there is a low<br />chance someone breaks something. I do<br />think there is a chance though because<br />a lot goes on in college and freak<br />accidents do happen.","Ian Driggers (25%): I think that UGA is<br />a better football team that Oregon but<br />I am not 100% confident. Football is a<br />sport and like any sport, anything can<br />happen on any given day.","Ian Driggers (60%): I haven’t lived<br />in athens very long but I think that<br />it will drop below 62° Fahrenheit by<br />September 31st.
