That said, every game there is<br />some chance of an upset, and those small<br />chances compound over 12 weeks. At the risk of<br />embarrassing myself twice in two years over the<br />same question...","Joe Ornstein (20%): Seems like it would be a bit<br />*too soon* on the heels of 1989 (TV) to announce<br />another re-release. Swiftologists analyzing the<br />Karma music video predict that Reputation (TV)<br />will be released during the solar eclipse on<br />April 8, 2024, and announced two months earlier<br />in February. But the question wording would also<br />be satisfied by a brand new studio album or a live<br />album, and Taylor Swift is *prolific*.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires are only negotiated<br />when *both* parties believe that peace is better<br />than what they could potentially achieve by<br />extending the conflict. And neither party believes<br />that right now. Putin thinks time is on his side:<br />Russian troops can hold their defensive line until<br />Western resolve and support dries up. And the<br />Ukrainian government is steadfastly opposed to any<br />negotiation that surrenders territory.","Joe Ornstein (90%): In the past 20 years of<br />weather data, it's happened every year except 2009<br />and 2020. But it's a squeaker; the temperature<br />in Athens usually dips below freezing only a<br />*few days* before Nov 29. This one will be a real<br />nail-biter.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): Georgia is coming off<br />back-to-back national championships and everyone<br />knows they are the team to beat. This means that<br />everyone will be gunning to beat them and circling<br />the uga game on their calendar as their chance<br />to shock the world. Our schedule is ridiculously<br />easy, and the out-of-conference games are a joke.<br />However, an SEC team, probably either Auburn,<br />Tennessee, or Florida will beat us in a game this<br />year. We will finish the regular season with one<br />loss","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): Taylor is dropping her<br />version of 1989 on October 27th, which means that<br />these songs will be the talk of teenage girls for<br />the next month. Her marketing is impressive and<br />her fanbase's dedication to her is even more so.<br />When this album drops, they will be satisfied for<br />at least a month and will not be clamoring for a<br />new one until at least a month later. Also, she<br />will not want to drop the albums close together<br />because they would drown each other out in the<br />press. Each one needs its own time.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): It appears as if the war<br />is headed to a stalemate, but not an official<br />one. Russia is dug into trenches and is not going<br />anywhere easily due to Putin's stubbornness.<br />However, Ukraine also doesn't have the manpower<br />to move them. I believe this will result in an<br />unofficial ceasefire that neither side officially<br />agrees to.","Ryan Wolkofsky (20%): Looking at last year's<br />weather, the temperature in Athens dropped below<br />32F a decent amount of times. However, none of<br />those came before November 29th. With the planet<br />warming each year, I do not see the temperature<br />getting lower this year than last year. Also, I<br />live in Charlotte, NC, and am familiar with the<br />climate of this region, The temperature tends to<br />get cold around the 2nd or 3rd week of December<br />but can stay in the 50s through New Year's Day.","Victoria Harrill (90%): The past two years they<br />have shown to be undefeated.","Victoria Harrill (85%): Speak Now (TV) just came<br />out, and she spaces them out a couple to a few<br />months apart.","Victoria Harrill (75%): The Wagner Chief was<br />confirmed dead in a plane crash which will damage<br />Russia's military abilities in Ukraine.","Victoria Harrill (35%): It is not common for<br />Georgia to get below freezing before December.","Jacob Fortner (85%): Our schedule is pretty weak<br />this year with our only semi-difficult game being<br />Ole Miss which is at home. As Carson Beck gets<br />more experience, he'll get better thus making us<br />better which is why I gave us an 85% chance to go<br />undefeated in the regular season.","Jacob Fortner (50%): I don't know anything about<br />Taylor Swift so I'm giving it a coin flip as my<br />prediction.","Jacob Fortner (10%): I think the war will only<br />end if there is significant intervening from the<br />western hemisphere in favor of Ukraine, if this<br />does not happen (which I'm not confident in) then<br />I do not think the war will end by the end of the<br />semester.","Jacob Fortner (25%): From how hot it has been the<br />past few years during wintertime and from the heat<br />of this year so far, I am not confident that there<br />will be a point in time before the end of the<br />semester where the temperature in Athens, GA with<br />drop below freezing.","Maggie Fertig (80%): They preformed very well<br />last year so the probability that they will be<br />undefeated again is high. However, there is a new<br />quarterback, so there is still some uncertainty<br />for how the team will perform.","Maggie Fertig (60%): Taylor Swift has been<br />releasing music at a rapid pace this year, already<br />with one new album and a couple re-recordings. I<br />think the odds of her announcing a new album is<br />high. But since she is working on re-recordings,<br />she may be too busy for new stuff.","Maggie Fertig (30%): The crisis has been ongoing<br />for a few months now. The odds that a ceasefire<br />will be reached before Nov 29 is low, especially<br />with tensions rising everyday. However, there is<br />still a slight possibility.","Maggie Fertig (30%): It is very rare that it gets<br />this cold in Athens in November, especially with<br />global warming. However it is possible to get cold<br />at night towards end of November month.","Duy Do (80%): Because we are the champion for 2<br />consecutive years","Duy Do (70%): Because she need a new album for the<br />next year.","Duy Do (30%): Because Ukraine still try to apply<br />to NATO","Duy Do (5%): Because the temperature has not been<br />dropped below 32F for many years","Kang Lee (80%): I believe that UGA has a very<br />solid chance of going undefeated again this<br />season with a low chance of being upturned by an<br />underdog.","Kang Lee (30%): I don't believe that there is a<br />significant enough event between now and Nov 29<br />for her to announce her final album. It'd be more<br />believable for her to announce her final album<br />after the hype around the eras tour dies down<br />and after 2023. I put the probability at 30 as<br />I believe that there may be a small chance that<br />she announces it but has it set for release much<br />further down the line.","Kang Lee (40%): I believe that Russia will pull<br />out of Ukraine before the end of the semester<br />but they will not announce their desire for a<br />ceasefire until 2024.
