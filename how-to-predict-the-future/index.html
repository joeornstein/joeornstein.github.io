That said, every game there is<br />some chance of an upset, and those small<br />chances compound over 12 weeks. At the risk of<br />embarrassing myself twice in two years over the<br />same question...","Joe Ornstein (20%): Seems like it would be a bit<br />*too soon* on the heels of 1989 (TV) to announce<br />another re-release. Swiftologists analyzing the<br />Karma music video predict that Reputation (TV)<br />will be released during the solar eclipse on<br />April 8, 2024, and announced two months earlier<br />in February. But the question wording would also<br />be satisfied by a brand new studio album or a live<br />album, and Taylor Swift is *prolific*.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires are only negotiated<br />when *both* parties believe that peace is better<br />than what they could potentially achieve by<br />extending the conflict. And neither party believes<br />that right now. Putin thinks time is on his side:<br />Russian troops can hold their defensive line until<br />Western resolve and support dries up. And the<br />Ukrainian government is steadfastly opposed to any<br />negotiation that surrenders territory.","Joe Ornstein (90%): In the past 20 years of<br />weather data, it's happened every year except 2009<br />and 2020. But it's a squeaker; the temperature<br />in Athens usually dips below freezing only a<br />*few days* before Nov 29. This one will be a real<br />nail-biter.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): Georgia is coming off<br />back-to-back national championships and everyone<br />knows they are the team to beat. This means that<br />everyone will be gunning to beat them and circling<br />the uga game on their calendar as their chance<br />to shock the world. Our schedule is ridiculously<br />easy, and the out-of-conference games are a joke.<br />However, an SEC team, probably either Auburn,<br />Tennessee, or Florida will beat us in a game this<br />year. We will finish the regular season with one<br />loss","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): Taylor is dropping her<br />version of 1989 on October 27th, which means that<br />these songs will be the talk of teenage girls for<br />the next month. Her marketing is impressive and<br />her fanbase's dedication to her is even more so.<br />When this album drops, they will be satisfied for<br />at least a month and will not be clamoring for a<br />new one until at least a month later. Also, she<br />will not want to drop the albums close together<br />because they would drown each other out in the<br />press. Each one needs its own time.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): It appears as if the war<br />is headed to a stalemate, but not an official<br />one. Russia is dug into trenches and is not going<br />anywhere easily due to Putin's stubbornness.<br />However, Ukraine also doesn't have the manpower<br />to move them. I believe this will result in an<br />unofficial ceasefire that neither side officially<br />agrees to.","Ryan Wolkofsky (20%): Looking at last year's<br />weather, the temperature in Athens dropped below<br />32F a decent amount of times. However, none of<br />those came before November 29th. With the planet<br />warming each year, I do not see the temperature<br />getting lower this year than last year. Also, I<br />live in Charlotte, NC, and am familiar with the<br />climate of this region, The temperature tends to<br />get cold around the 2nd or 3rd week of December<br />but can stay in the 50s through New Year's Day.","Victoria Harrill (90%): The past two years they<br />have shown to be undefeated.","Victoria Harrill (85%): Speak Now (TV) just came<br />out, and she spaces them out a couple to a few<br />months apart.","Victoria Harrill (75%): The Wagner Chief was<br />confirmed dead in a plane crash which will damage<br />Russia's military abilities in Ukraine.","Victoria Harrill (35%): It is not common for<br />Georgia to get below freezing before December.","Jacob Fortner (85%): Our schedule is pretty weak<br />this year with our only semi-difficult game being<br />Ole Miss which is at home. As Carson Beck gets<br />more experience, he'll get better thus making us<br />better which is why I gave us an 85% chance to go<br />undefeated in the regular season.","Jacob Fortner (50%): I don't know anything about<br />Taylor Swift so I'm giving it a coin flip as my<br />prediction.","Jacob Fortner (10%): I think the war will only<br />end if there is significant intervening from the<br />western hemisphere in favor of Ukraine, if this<br />does not happen (which I'm not confident in) then<br />I do not think the war will end by the end of the<br />semester.","Jacob Fortner (25%): From how hot it has been the<br />past few years during wintertime and from the heat<br />of this year so far, I am not confident that there<br />will be a point in time before the end of the<br />semester where the temperature in Athens, GA with<br />drop below freezing.","Maggie Fertig (80%): They preformed very well<br />last year so the probability that they will be<br />undefeated again is high. However, there is a new<br />quarterback, so there is still some uncertainty<br />for how the team will perform.","Maggie Fertig (60%): Taylor Swift has been<br />releasing music at a rapid pace this year, already<br />with one new album and a couple re-recordings. I<br />think the odds of her announcing a new album is<br />high. But since she is working on re-recordings,<br />she may be too busy for new stuff.","Maggie Fertig (30%): The crisis has been ongoing<br />for a few months now. The odds that a ceasefire<br />will be reached before Nov 29 is low, especially<br />with tensions rising everyday. However, there is<br />still a slight possibility.","Maggie Fertig (30%): It is very rare that it gets<br />this cold in Athens in November, especially with<br />global warming. However it is possible to get cold<br />at night towards end of November month.","Duy Do (80%): Because we are the champion for 2<br />consecutive years","Duy Do (70%): Because she need a new album for the<br />next year.","Duy Do (30%): Because Ukraine still try to apply<br />to NATO","Duy Do (5%): Because the temperature has not been<br />dropped below 32F for many years","Kang Lee (80%): I believe that UGA has a very<br />solid chance of going undefeated again this<br />season with a low chance of being upturned by an<br />underdog.","Kang Lee (30%): I don't believe that there is a<br />significant enough event between now and Nov 29<br />for her to announce her final album. It'd be more<br />believable for her to announce her final album<br />after the hype around the eras tour dies down<br />and after 2023. I put the probability at 30 as<br />I believe that there may be a small chance that<br />she announces it but has it set for release much<br />further down the line.","Kang Lee (40%): I believe that Russia will pull<br />out of Ukraine before the end of the semester<br />but they will not announce their desire for a<br />ceasefire until 2024. I believe that while Putin<br />is in power a ceasefire will not be called and<br />a coup will take a while to fully take away the<br />authority of Putin.","Kang Lee (10%): As we live in GA based on past<br />weather patterns and current forecasts for the<br />future it s very unlikely that the temperature<br />will drop below freezing unless a flash cold front<br />were to appear out of the blue.","Simryn Patel (90%): we are two time national<br />champions","Simryn Patel (85%): she is on a good track to<br />doing this, she has been releasing one very often","Simryn Patel (30%): it has been a very long war<br />and negotiations are not being created easily","Simryn Patel (15%): It has been very hot this year<br />and later years have not gotten that cold at all","Hita Boddu (85%): UGA Football was undefeated last<br />season.","Hita Boddu (25%): She has an album coming out<br />in late October, so it is highly unlikely she'll<br />release one soon.","Hita Boddu (50%): Political disputes are<br />unpredictable so it could go either way.","Hita Boddu (25%): It usually doesn't get that cold<br />until December / January."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"circle","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"FALSE","legendgroup":"FALSE","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.33000000000000002,0.47999999999999998,0.28000000000000003,0.75],"y":[0.97934013912454243,1.9628812623210252,2.9758471796289085,3.9750605657929556],"text":["Class

The Mega Millions is a very elusive<br />prize, that the odds of drawing it is very low.","Maggie Fertig (40%): While women do perform well<br />on this show, in the past they have been voted off<br />first. Based on this, after only a few weeks, I<br />predict there will be more men than women.","Maggie Fertig (40%): While two tracks form her<br />previous album hit the No. 1 spot, I think the<br />chances are low that at least one song on this<br />album will hit No. 1 because right now on the<br />charts, vampire is going down and the other<br />highest spot is 39 and going down.","samiha sarwar (35%): While I know time isn't<br />the matter but someone recently won. I think the<br />chances of someone else winning is low.","samiha sarwar (25%): I don't know much about<br />survivor, but what I know about its a lot of<br />physical challenges. Men are typically better at<br />physical challenges.","samiha sarwar (95%): When her album comes out at<br />least one song has hot No. 1. She is a very good<br />artist with a large audience.","Joe Ornstein (63%): Two ways of thinking about<br />this one. On the one hand, if you look back at all<br />the Mega Millions jackpot winners over the past<br />five years, it is *very* rare to see a period of<br />77 days in which there's no winner. If you pick a<br />random 77-day period, there's about an 85% chance<br />that it will contain a jackpot winner. That said,<br />we just had a big >$1 billion jackpot, and ticket<br />sales tend to slum after those big wins, leading<br />to reduced odds of winning. There are about 11<br />million tickets being sold for each drawing,<br />22 drawings left, and 1 in 302 million odds of<br />winning the jackpot. Putting all that together,<br />you get roughly 55% chance of a ticket winning<br />the jackpot before Nov 29, but I'll bump that up<br />a bit since I expect tickets sales to increase the<br />larger the jackpot gets.","Joe Ornstein (40%): Looking back at the past 15<br />seasons of Survivor (I didn't have the stamina to<br />go farther back than that), the ninth season of<br />the show ends with more women than men 40% of the<br />time.","Joe Ornstein (80%): \"Will\" is, I think, the key<br />word here. The lead single \"Vampire\" already hit<br />No. 1 before the album released. Will it go back<br />to No 1? Will another track from the album hit No.<br />1? Three from her first record did, and Guts has<br />received a lot of critical acclaim, so I think the<br />odds are good.","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (50%): 50/50 chance<br />because the lottery is an unpredictable event","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (30%): In the past, men<br />have been more likely to win the show. Women have<br />won 17 seasons men have won 26.","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (75%): With her first<br />album, \"Driver's License\" hit number one. She<br />has several fans, so it is a high possibility it<br />happens again with her new album by November.","Bain Fulcher (2%): The odds of winning a Mega<br />Millions jackpot is about 1 in 302.6 million. So,<br />it is very unlikely that someone will win between<br />now and November 29.","Bain Fulcher (40%): Typically, more women than<br />men are voted out in the show. 17 seasons have<br />been won by women, and 26 have been won by men. 14<br />of the past 19 seasons have been won by men. So,<br />there is a chance that these trends will continue,<br />and that there will be more men than women<br />remaining on the show.","Bain Fulcher (85%): Her song \"Vampire\" from the<br />album is already number 9 on the list, so there<br />is a good chance that her songs will continue to<br />climb and that at least one will hit No.1.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (85%): It seems likely.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (41%): Men have won 22 of the 37<br />seasons. This means that they have won 59% of the<br />time. Women have won 41%.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (20%): Her hit songs of this album<br />are not that good.","Hita Boddu (15%): Only 212 jackpots have been won<br />since the game began.","Hita Boddu (40%): There are 8 men and 7 women in<br />the cast.","Hita Boddu (100%): Many of her songs from SOUR hit<br />No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100.","Harini Mohan (15%): No one had won a Mega Million<br />jackpot since April 18. It's played in 45 states<br />so the odds are pretty low for someone in Georgia<br />to win.","Harini Mohan (20%): In the past, it can be seen<br />that often more men win over women. Men have won<br />the last 5 seasons too.","Harini Mohan (100%): Her new album \"Guts\" has<br />gotten popular on social media handles like<br />TikTok. One of her songs \"Vampire\" is already<br />standing at #9.","Harshini Mohan (40%): The odds of winning that is<br />low.","Harshini Mohan (45%): In the past, more men have<br />won than women.","Harshini Mohan (85%): Her new album is getting<br />alot of attention and she might go on tour."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"circle","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"FALSE","legendgroup":"FALSE","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.65000000000000002,0.46000000000000002,0.35999999999999999],"y":[1.0254247284727172,2.0138190229889004,3.0358541789697484],"text":["Class Average (65%)","Class Average (46%)","Class Average (36%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"circle","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"TRUE","legendgroup":"TRUE","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["One or more of the songs<br />on Olivia Rodrigo's<br />sophomore album will hit<br />No. 1 on the Billboard<br />Hot 100.","Someone will win the Mega<br />Millions jackpot between<br />September 13 and November<br />29.","There will be more women<br />than men remaining on<br />the TV show Survivor on<br />November 29."],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["One or more of the songs<br />on Olivia Rodrigo's<br />sophomore album will hit<br />No. 1 on the Billboard<br />Hot 100.","Someone will win the Mega<br />Millions jackpot between<br />September 13 and November<br />29.","There will be more women<br />than men remaining on<br />the TV show Survivor on<br />November 29."],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"75ac51a118aa":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"75ac68511d57":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"75ac51a118aa","visdat":{"75ac51a118aa":["function (y) ","x"],"75ac68511d57":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
