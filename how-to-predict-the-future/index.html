Because<br />of our winning streak when it comes to home games<br />if do lose a game it’s more likely to be an away<br />game. Furthermore, Florida has very strong players<br />and the home advantage so it’s very possible that<br />we lose that game.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (65%): I believe that although<br />much of my prediction is based on Stockton’s<br />performance I do think we could possibly lose one<br />game against Tennessee or possibly tech because<br />it is much later in the season. Given their<br />consistency, depth, and ability to step up in big<br />games at home, it’s reasonable to believe Georgia<br />has about a 65% chance to sweep all home games in<br />2025.","Alizah Mudaliar (40%): Although Georgia is<br />predicted to be a dominating team during its<br />away games, having a hard home game schedule,<br />improvements in other teams, and starting with<br />a new quarterback may provide some challenges in<br />winning every game. Homefield advantage may play<br />into this, but I think the hardest games for UGA<br />to win will be Florida and Tennessee.","Amanda Neighbour (22.6%): I believe the chance of<br />UGA winning all of our away games this upcoming<br />season is rather unlikely. The Bulldogs have a<br />home game win streak of 32, however, they lost to<br />Ole Miss and Alabama, as well as almost a third<br />time to Georgia Tech this previous season. I found<br />the average of the ESPN money lines and the match<br />up predictor percentages for each UGA away game in<br />the 2025 CFB Season. By averaging ESPN analytics<br />with betting odds, I incorporated a greater set<br />of data into my final prediction. Overall, based<br />on these factors, I estimate that UGA has around a<br />22% chance of winning every away game this season.","Anna Barton-Caucci (30%): I think there is a<br />30% chance that UGA wins all of the away games<br />because the probabilities of individual away<br />games against quality opponents or the opponents<br />that actually pose a threat to UGA (Florida and<br />Tennessee)averaged is around 60% and when you<br />multiply those together the odds are cut in half.","Anna Kneser (35%): There are 5 away games this<br />season, so I feel as though UGA is bound to lose<br />at least one of them. The games I am most worried<br />about are the Tennessee game and the Florida game.<br />UGA is known for their home field advantage with<br />having a long undefeated streak for home games. In<br />someone’s briefing, they said UGA is bound to lose<br />at least one game, and I think it is more likely<br />for them to lose an away game than a home game.<br />Based on the likelihood of UGA winning each game,<br />I calculated it and I think there is a 35% chance<br />they will lose at least one game.","Arshia Charkhian (45%): Georgia’s record<br />against the teams away from home has been solid<br />historically. Those teams have also not seen huge<br />upgrades during the offseason like Georgia has.<br />Tennessee will cause the most challenge since<br />Neyland is a hard place to travel to. Although the<br />UGA vs Tech is being played in Atlanta, there is<br />still strong support for the Bulldogs to the point<br />where it could be seen as a home game; the same<br />can be said about the Florida game.","Blake Martin (65%): While Georgia has shown to<br />be strong against these opponents in recent years<br />(The teams have not beaten us in 5+years) and<br />Kirby Smart's coaching is top-tier, there are<br />still challenges that I foresee as being issues<br />this upcoming season. New quarterbacks between<br />Auburn, Georgia and Tennessee spark uncertainty on<br />how each school will do. This is especially true<br />with our early-season matchup against Tennessee.<br />Auburns bye week and home field advantage also<br />could tip the scales in a close game. Florida<br />recently has improved talent and it being at a<br />neutral site could be a wildcard between the two.<br />Mississippi State and Georgia Tech might not seem<br />like big threats but unpredictable moments always<br />exist like when we played Ole Miss last season<br />and lost. In regards to Georgia Tech though, they<br />have not beaten us outside of Sanford Stadium<br />since 1999. I do not see that changing this year.<br />Given these, I'm optimistic but also cautious that<br />Georgia has a 65% chance of winning all their away<br />games this season.","Breanne Talley (40%): With a first-year<br />quarterback leading the way and a handful of<br />tough, emotional games ahead, Georgia is likely<br />to stumble at least once in its away schedule.<br />Whether it’s Florida in Jacksonville, Tennessee<br />in Knoxville, or a surprise upset against a<br />rival, the odds aren’t in favor of a flawless<br />road season. My forecast: Georgia goes 4–1 in away<br />games. My numbers come from taking the probability<br />of Georgia winning each game and multiplying them,<br />since it is a joint probability that they all win.<br />[Ten=.619]*[Aub=.913]*[Flor=.799]*[MS St=.973]*[Ga<br />Tech=.898]=[Probability of them winning all away<br />game=39.4%] I rounded up in my final answer for a<br />little bit of hope and uncertainty.","Caleb Lux (30%): After reviewing all of the<br />evidence, I am somewhat confident that UGA will<br />lose at least one of its away games this season.<br />While the chances of our victory for each game is<br />favorable, the uncertainty arising from Tennessee,<br />Florida, and potentially Auburn create enough<br />doubt to make it more likely than not that we will<br />lose at least one of those games. Specifically,<br />I assigned the following probabilities to win for<br />each game: State .97, Auburn .9, Tennessee .6,<br />Florida .6, Tech .95. This results in a 30% chance<br />that we win every game, thus my prediction.","Caroline Mattox (75%): Georgia has an extremely<br />tough schedule. Playing on the road in the SEC is<br />not an easy task no matter where you play. I think<br />there is a high chance that we lose an away game<br />this season. Florida alone presents an extreme<br />threat. I wouldn’t say any of these teams are<br />necessarily better than Georgia but I think there<br />is a very high chance that the fatigue sets in at<br />some point and we just get outplayed. Or maybe we<br />win a big game and the “we’ve got this” attitude<br />sets in and we just lose a game. I think we have<br />the capability to win every game we play but I am<br />nervous about the difficulty level of our schedule<br />and that’s why I have given a lower probability","Chris Haswell (60%): Most sports betting sites<br />have the Dawgs winning every away game. Some<br />experts predict Florida as being our only loss.<br />We've beaten Florida every year I've been here,<br />and I am confident in Gunner Stockton's abilities<br />based on the end of last season. It also feels<br />sacriligious to lose faith in the team, so I<br />predict a narrow Florida victory to cement our<br />away game dominance.","Cierra Green (40%): Of these games, the two<br />most concerning are Tennessee and Florida. When<br />researching various websites (ESPN, CBS, NY Times,<br />Online Athens, UGA Wire), each had different<br />opinions about these two games. However, even if<br />UGA were to win either one, the predicted ending<br />score was close (24 to 20 for GA v TN and 27 to<br />24 for GA v FL on two websites). Additionally,<br />DJ Lagway of Florida is projected to have a good<br />season. I believe it is very likely that Georgia<br />will win 4 of these games, but statistically, it<br />is unlikely that Georgia will win all 5. Using<br />joint probability, even if Georgia had a 90%<br />chance of winning each game, the probability would<br />only be 59% for winning all 5. Lowering those<br />chances for both Florida and Tennessee brings that<br />probability further down. I also asked my friends<br />(who are lifelong UGA fans) their opinion, and<br />they said UGA would lose at least one of these<br />games. One cited that Georgia has a track record<br />of underestimating certain teams and believes<br />we will lose to Mississippi State. Although not<br />professional opinions, their belief that Georgia<br />will lose a game despite their bias helped me in<br />this decision.","Elizabeth Nelson (23%): Courtesy of my football<br />obsessed boyfriend, I discovered ESPN's FPI win<br />probabilities for UGA's 2025 away/neutral site<br />regular season football games. As I learned in<br />class today, I found the joint probability by<br />multiplying each games' win probability. I think<br />23 is a safe guess because often Florida and<br />Georgia Tech are toss-up games, right at 50-50,<br />so it seems more in my favor that we will lose at<br />least one game on the road. I give Georgia a 23%<br />chance of winning all away and neutral site games<br />this regular season.","Sade Ezekiel (54%): Georgia has a good track<br />record of winning against every team they will<br />be playing away this season. Even though our team<br />will be starting a new quarterback, the confidence<br />is high that we will still have a successful<br />season. Our defense and offense have great stats<br />against these teams. The only game that could<br />potentially be an upset is the Auburn game. This<br />is because the Auburn game is considered the<br />oldest rivalry in the south, and because both<br />teams play each other very closely. Many believe<br />that the Jordan Harris stadium is cursed, so<br />playing there is also an intimidating factor for<br />a lot of teams. With that being said, if we were<br />to lose one game, the Auburn game would be the<br />one we might lose. I am still confident that with<br />Georgia's coaching and great athletes, we will<br />take home the win. Prediction = 54% confident that<br />we will win every away game!","Francesca Mariano (29%): Many of the briefs stated<br />that they think Georgia will loose at least one<br />of the away games. They emphasized the strength<br />and good record of Georgia, but also how games<br />can easily be upsets and we aren't positive<br />how many of the new players will pan out, on<br />Georgia's team and our opponents' teams. In the<br />the three years I have been a student at UGA, we<br />have had an incredible record, record breaking<br />records, of consecutive wins. I in no way claim<br />to be a football expert, but knowing how well we<br />typically perform and how well we are expected<br />to perform, I gave each away game a baseline of<br />80% of Georgia winning. With many of the briefs<br />saying we will loose at lease one, I decreased one<br />of the probabilities to 70%. I multiplied these<br />probabilities and got about 29% probability that<br />Georgia wins all their away games.","Ellie Null (79%): While I do believe that UGA will<br />have a great season and away game track record.<br />I also think that there Is one game that poses<br />a threat. I have no doubt in my mind that we<br />will beat Tennessee, Auburn and the rest of the<br />away game schedule. I do think that Florida will<br />poses a threat. this game is always hard to gauge<br />due to the lack of home field advantage and the<br />new factor of our new quarterback. i think that<br />Florida has an amazing quarterback and that it<br />wouldn't surprise me if they ended up taking the<br />win. I think it also depends on how Gunner does in<br />these first few games. These elements end lessen<br />my confidence in winning all of the games. there<br />is a 21 percent chance that Florida might beat us<br />in my mind. But I do think we will win everyone<br />but possibly this one.","Hunter Murray (26.2%): I used the ESPN win<br />percentage, the ESPN money line, and my own<br />knowledge and research about each game to build<br />a probability tree. I then took the compound<br />probability directly from that tree. I feel like I<br />could be slightly more confident, but I also think<br />we face risks in the Florida, GT, and especially<br />Tennessee.","Jackson Bost (30%): Georgia, with a physical<br />offense and evergreen defense, will have wins<br />at Tennessee (.8) and Auburn (.8) thanks to<br />their inexperienced offenses, notch an all<br />but guaranteed win against a historically<br />poor Mississippi State (.95), likely defeat an<br />all-or-nothing Tech (.75) team, but may fall short<br />when facing a veteran Florida (.65) team with the<br />explosive DJ Lagway. While some analysts and Vegas<br />still favor Georgia, this game will be Georgia's<br />biggest hurdle. When multiplying each games'<br />probability, the probability that UGA football<br />will win all of their away games this regular<br />season is .3.","James Hunter Darke (40%): I predict that Georgia<br />will lose an away game this regular season with<br />about 60% confidence. While the dawgs will be<br />favored in every game, with the rigorous schedule<br />and venues, they will drop one game. I have a<br />lot of faith in them, but I think we will fall<br />to either Tennessee or Auburn in an absolute<br />shootout.","Jhaycee Barnes (40%): Georgia is talented enough<br />to be favored in every away game, but winning all<br />of them is tough. Auburn and Tennessee both have<br />strong home-field advantages, and Florida and Tech<br />can get unpredictable (as we saw last season).<br />Even if Georgia is the better team overall, the<br />odds of slipping up at least once feel higher than<br />them pulling off a perfect season away.","Kira Fleischer (40%): Taking into account the<br />briefings, it seems likely that UGA will win<br />MOST of the away games, however Florida poses a<br />significant challenge. Considering the UF game,<br />the possible difficulty of Auburn, and the unknown<br />skills of Gunner, I find it unlikely that UGA will<br />win every single away game.","Kristoffer Fields (20%): I believe that UGA will<br />lose an away game because there are too many away<br />games with too many formidable opponents. Also I<br />mathematically calculated all of my probabilities<br />by multiplying my confidence for each away game<br />and I was at around roughly 30% chance all of<br />the games are won by the University of Georgia.<br />Furthermore, the football team, while still an<br />elite contender, has gone down in popularity<br />and quality over the years, therefore I think it<br />is safe to say that it is more likely that the<br />football team loses at least one away game.","Liz Yancey (22%): I am 40% confident that UGA<br />will win every away game this regular season.<br />I looked up UGA's chance of winning/losing on<br />ESPN's Matchup Predictor. They all predicted that<br />UGA would win every away game. I then multiplied<br />every chance UGA would win and the result was .22,<br />which is why I think there's a 22% chance of them<br />winning every away game this regular season.","Manuv Datta (40%): It is my belief that UGA will<br />not be successful in winning all of their away<br />games this season. I base this prediction on the<br />results of last season's performances. There were<br />various games last year in which UGA struggled<br />mightly with UNRANKED opponents. With the strength<br />of the current schedule, and the amount of ranked<br />opponents away, I find it likely that UGA will<br />struggle early in a game and not be able to make<br />a comeback. This loss will not remove them from an<br />opportunity at the college football playoff.","Mateo Ceron (40%): I chose 40% because I had a<br />conversation with a couple of the people that did<br />briefings and realized that a majority of them<br />were pretty confident for most of UGA's schedule,<br />excluding one or two games. In class we also heard<br />from one of the people that did briefings AND<br />did the math for that specific person's thoughts,<br />which came out to about a 42% chance of winning<br />out for our whole away schedule, but only based<br />off one person's analysis (and that 42% chance was<br />optimistic). Therefore I decided I would subtract<br />a couple of percentage points to make up for any<br />biases in his percentage predictions and everyone<br />else's (because obviously we want our team to<br />succeed), and ended up at a 40% chance of winning<br />our whole schedule.","Nic Curtis (30%): To come up with my probability,<br />I assigned each game their own probability and<br />multiplied them together. .85 for Tennessee,<br />Auburn, and Georgia Tech, .55 for Florida, .95<br />for Charlotte and Mississippi State. I did this<br />because the question is a joint probability<br />question and each event is independent of each<br />other.","Owen Johnston (31.752%): I give GA a probability<br />0.7 of beating TN given that TN is a difficult<br />home environment, but they lost a lot of good<br />offensive players to the draft and have a brand<br />new, untested quarterback. I give GA a probability<br />of 0.9 to beat Auburn given that Auburn has<br />lost so many players to the portal and has poor<br />preseason prospects. I give GA a probability of<br />0.8 to beat FL due to the neutral site location<br />which eliminates home advantage and an improved<br />team, however, the FL quarterback missed a lot of<br />last season and has less experience. I give UGA<br />a probability of 0.9 to beat MS State. MS State<br />is last in the SEC and had a poor recruiting<br />record. Finally, I give GA a probability of<br />0.7 to beat Tech given the close game from last<br />season, however, it cannot be outweighed by<br />Tech's overall offensive line performance and<br />the fact that I think the game being played at<br />Mercedes-Benz stadium will benefit UGA. All of<br />these probabilities multiplied together give UGA<br />a 0.31752 probability of winning all of their away<br />games this season.","Paul Frilingos (22.5%): ESPN Analytics has<br />probabilities calculated on their website for<br />each game of the 2025 college football season.<br />This takes into account all factors related to<br />performance, like recruiting, transfers, and home<br />field advantage. Multiplying the probability that<br />Georgia wins each away game this season together<br />creates the joint probability of about 22.5%.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (27%): I read<br />my classmates’ briefings and asked ChatGPT to<br />break down the betting odds in order to calculate<br />the win probability for each game and then<br />calculate the overall chance of going undefeated<br />on the road. According to ChatGPT, based on the<br />information in the briefings, the chances of<br />winning are about 74% for Tennessee, 68% for<br />Auburn, 71% for Florida, 86% for Georgia Tech, and<br />close to 90% for Mississippi State. Multiplying<br />these gives around a 25–35% chance of winning them<br />all. As Hunter put it, Tennessee’s fast offense,<br />Auburn’s home-field advantage, and Florida’s<br />emerging quarterback make those games real risks.<br />So I think 4–1 is much more likely than winning<br />all the away games.","Reese Fabritius (25%): Using ESPN stats, UGA<br />has about a 6.5% chance of going undefeated<br />overall—this season. However, if you multiply the<br />probability that UGA will win each of its away<br />games (0.65, 0.7, 0.7, 0.8, 0.85) you get around<br />0.22. However, I think those numbers are slightly<br />inflated by preseason optimism, and UGA will be<br />more greatly favored as the season goes on.","Ruhi Doddamani (28%): I did the joint probability<br />calculation on all of the games, multiplied them<br />all up. I read through the briefs and tried to<br />familiarize myself with which games are most<br />likely to be the team's pitfall this season. I<br />think Florida presents the biggest challenge, just<br />by players' stats. I also looked at the betting<br />sites' numbers, and after accounting for their<br />inflated lines to get people to bet more, Fanduel<br />and Prizepicks are coming around the mid-20s range<br />as well. ESPN has a 22%. 28% UGA goes undefeated<br />is my most generous guess. Fingers crossed!","Ryan Marx (80%): The reason that i believe that<br />the Bulldogs will only have around an 80 percent<br />chance of winning every away and neutral ground<br />game comes down to what teams and are on the<br />schedule and the location at which they are being<br />played. Starting with those at home the difficult<br />games of the season are: Alabama who we lost<br />against 41-34 last year,Texas which was a close<br />call with Georgia only beating them 22 to 19 in<br />2024, and Finally there is Ole Miss which Georgia<br />also lost against in 2024 by an embarrassing 10<br />to 24. Furthermore our remaining games at home<br />are made up of lower ranked schools such as<br />Marshall(which lost to Georgia 13-3 back in 2004<br />and Austin Peay( which was absolutely crushed back<br />in 2018 by a whopping 45-0). Compared to the Away<br />and Neutral Schedule which makes up around 5 games<br />of the season the only two legitimate schools that<br />pose any threat to this challenge are Tennessee<br />who put up a slugging match that resulted in a<br />31-17 victory. and Auburn, a school that is a<br />bitter rival to Georgia and also narrowly lost<br />by 31 to 13 last year. Out of the 5 home Games I<br />believe that only Tennessee has any real chance<br />to beat Georgia, of course you always have the<br />home field advantage, something that Tennessee has<br />locked in while playing at Neyland, combine this<br />with the fact that Georgia has typically struggled<br />with Away Games and that Tennessee always puts<br />up a strong offense with Breakneck plays leads me<br />to believe that outside of the 80 percent chance<br />Georgia does win every away and neutral Game, then<br />there is a 20 percent chance that Georgia will<br />lose an away or neutral game","Sarah Kate Maher (54%): We've already beat the<br />teams on our away schedule, and though some of<br />them might be improving, they will not be at the<br />level that Georgia will be this year. The reason<br />my probability is so low is that we've been<br />suprised by how UGA plays before, and can never be<br />too sure, especially in trap games like MS State.<br />We also almost lost to GA Tech last year, and<br />Florida and Auburn are always tougher games.","Sasha Mahtani (35%): UGA has some fierce<br />competitors considering their away games, and I<br />am most worried about Auburn and Georgia Tech.<br />After today's briefings in class and learning<br />that Auburn's team has a decent outlook on their<br />season, I feel most threatened that they will beat<br />us. Considering our performance against Georgia<br />Tech last year and how we barely scraped by past<br />a win, there is some chance they will beat us<br />as well, especially considering their home base<br />advantage.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (67%): I believe UGA Football<br />will win all of their away games this season<br />primarily because of their away record. In the<br />past 5 seasons, UGA only lost 3 away games, 2 of<br />them last season. Those 2 teams are home games<br />this season, so the other teams are ones UGA is<br />known to beat. The closest matchup last year that<br />is an away game this year is Georgia Tech, and it<br />was under presiding quarterback Gunner Stockton's<br />substitution for Carson Beck that led us to<br />victory in the eight-overtime thriller. That being<br />said, it is extremely easy to lose a game for any<br />sort of reason, which is why I am optimistically<br />cautious- at 67%.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (80%): I think that Georgia<br />will win all away games this normal season.<br />I am 80% confident. I considered factors like<br />recruitment, transfers, distance to stadium,<br />professional opinions by sports predicting<br />professionals, effectiveness/character/newness of<br />coaches, home and away game advantage performance,<br />historical wins in matches (scores and wins),<br />quarterback performance, offence vs defense<br />performance, and the home game lineup (UGA<br />home game lineup is intense). I chose 80% as my<br />confidence level because I am only concerned about<br />one game in the normal season. I am concerned<br />about UGA losing the Tech game after their<br />performance last year.","Zafar Ali (45%): Originally I believed that there<br />was little to no chance that the UGA football<br />team would be able to win every single away game.<br />However, based on the briefings and overall class<br />discussion, I have been swayed a little to the<br />idea that there is a more likely chance they will.<br />Based on the pervious 2024 season, UGA lost two of<br />the away games. Those being Ole Miss and Alabama.<br />Looking at this year's schedule, the teams they<br />will be playing do not seem as difficult as last<br />year. Florida seems to be the biggest challenge as<br />their quarter back is returning from the previous<br />season and has been noted to be performing quite<br />well. Aside from this, Gunner Stockton is now<br />taking the role as starter QB for this season.<br />We can't say for certain how well he will do,<br />however, he was able to help the team through<br />those games. I am not 100% on them winning because<br />there are multiple games rather than just one. We<br />have to account for each. However, to conclude, I<br />believe there is a 45% because I still think they<br />will at least lose one game."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.40000000000000002],"y":[0.97387479799799626],"text":"Crowd (40%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.52000000000000002],"y":[1.0349750783061609],"text":"Joe Ornstein (52%): It's a bit too early for<br />me to trust any of the point spreads listed on<br />the sportsbooks -- they all seem a touch too<br />conservative.

Not only does this precedent make it highly<br />unlikely in my opinion, but we also have the state<br />of Florida as a barrier that takes the brunt of<br />damage/impact from hurricanes. If you look at past<br />hurricanes that were Cat 4 or higher when making<br />contact with the U.S. (specifically Florida),<br />none have retained their momentum and crossed<br />into GA as a Cat 4, instead dying down to a Cat 2<br />or 3 instead. On top of all this, our discussion<br />in class further reinstated the fact that such a<br />high category hurricane is highly unlikely. But<br />unnatural events can always occur, and weather<br />isn't easy to predict or track so taking that<br />into account I set my probability as something<br />relatively low, but not 0.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (35%): The Epstein Files are<br />unlikely to be released because the documents have<br />recently just been put through the House under a<br />different process and it takes the government many<br />months to process any sort of documentation. There<br />is still a possibility however as recently the<br />files were turned by House Committee and they've<br />been threatening to relase the files into the<br />public.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (5%): I believe there can only<br />be a 5 percent chance of a category 4 hurricane<br />hitting Georgia beacuse of the fact that as<br />the hurricane would hit the coast it would lose<br />significant amount of power on the land and<br />become at most a category 3. While the Atlantic<br />hurricane season runs through November, historical<br />records show that major hurricanes almost never<br />make landfall in Georgia, so the risk remains<br />very low even during peak months. While it is<br />not impossible for a Category 4 storm to reach<br />the state, the combination of limited coastline,<br />typical storm tracks, and rapid weakening after<br />landfall makes the probability very low.","Alizah Mudaliar (30%): Because of the limited<br />time frame of the forecast, complex legal issues<br />regarding certain document releases, and mixed<br />bipartisan support, I think there is about a<br />30% chance of some document of the Epstein files<br />being released. There is a lot of public pressure<br />and some Republican representatives supporting<br />the release, which may help sway support for the<br />files’ release. There is likely a higher chance<br />for the House to pass a resolution to release the<br />files than the Senate.","Alizah Mudaliar (5%): I think there is a 5% chance<br />of a hurricane (Cat. 4 or 5) hits Georgia. This<br />season is expected to be strong due to a longer<br />ENSO-neutral phase in the Pacific and strong<br />waves and winds from the West African Monsoon<br />moving west. The Georgia coast is relatively small<br />compared to the Gulf, Florida, and the Carolinas.<br />The curvature of the coast provides a buffer<br />against a strong hurricane turning sharply to<br />hit as a Category 4. It has been almost 127 years<br />since a Category 4 hurricane hit Georgia.","Amanda Neighbour (10%): From a logistical<br />standpoint, September-November 25th is a very<br />thin timeline, not to mention how slow Congress<br />is. Introducing a bill, going through committees,<br />having it scheduled and passed by both chambers,<br />and signed all before November 25th is a compact<br />timeline--one that can not be expected by this<br />hyperpartisan Congress. Republicans have the<br />majority in both houses, and will more than likely<br />advocate for the president. It is also possible<br />that information could be released through court<br />processes or executive branch declassification.<br />S. 2557 and H.Res. 577 are both in the Judiciary<br />Committees with no further action. A Democratic<br />amendment requiring the DOJ to release the<br />Epstein files was blocked by House Republicans<br />in mid-July. Speaker Mike Johnson is against the<br />release as claiming victim protections. Partial<br />progress can be expected, but passage seems lofty.","Amanda Neighbour (4%): The most convincing<br />evidence is that the last major hurricane to hit<br />Georgia was in 1898, despite global warming and<br />differing conditions. We are in an ENSO-neutral<br />state, which is a middle ground between El Niño<br />and La Niña, where hurricanes can be strengthened,<br />but not as much as a La Niña. The hurricanes<br />that hit Georgia in the past few years hit as<br />a tropical storm and a category 2 hurricane. A<br />hurricane with windspeed of 130-156 mph is very<br />unlikely to hit Georgia. Because of the shape<br />of Georgia's coast and the barrier islands,<br />Georgia receives very little direct hits and has<br />a moderate-high return period--the frequency in<br />number of years a location will be affected by a<br />major hurricane.","Ana Valencia (25%): Based on historical data on<br />the inquiry procedure, it indicates only about a<br />15 percent chance that a disclosure resolution is<br />adopted in a given Congress. I believe there is<br />higher chances for the House to pass a resolution<br />compared to the Senate, since H.Res. 589 has<br />already advanced through the Rules Committee and<br />could be scheduled for debate. I would like to<br />assign a 25 percent chance of the probability<br />that either chamber adopts a measure explicitly<br />directing DOJ to release Epstein-related files<br />before November 25, 2025. The most plausible path<br />is House adoption of H.Res. 589 under suspension<br />or by rule in September or October.","Ana Valencia (0.6%): The only known Cat-4 Georgia<br />hurricane landfall was in 1851 to the present,<br />and the Atlantic season runs June 1 to November<br />30 with peak mid-August to mid-October, so it<br />is highly unlikely there is one that will make<br />landfall because it is a chance of 1/174 hurricane<br />seasons. Furthermore, because of the geological<br />conditions of our state, landfalls are extremely<br />rare and the only Cat-4 landfall was on Cumberland<br />Island, GA. NOAA’s August 7 update still calls<br />for an above-normal 2025 season with 5 to 9<br />hurricanes, but it is for the whole basin and not<br />just for GA.","Anna Barton-Caucci (25%): Based on everything<br />happening right now, I think there is a 30% chance<br />of real legislative action before the November<br />25th deadline. The committee investigations will<br />probably continue and we might see some individual<br />documents released, but comprehensive legislation<br />requiring full disclosure seems unlikely.The<br />biggest factors working against this are Speaker<br />Johnson's resistance, the limited time frame,<br />and the complex legal issues involved in document<br />release. While public interest is high and there's<br />some bipartisan support, those political obstacles<br />and setbacks are just too significant to overcome<br />quickly.","Anna Barton-Caucci (3%): I believe that it is<br />highly unlikely that a hurricane will hit the<br />state of Georgia before November 25th because<br />Georgia has only ever had 1 hurricane of this<br />category before and we have a convex coastline<br />and are mostly protected by Florida. There have<br />been very few instances of hurricanes in Georgia,<br />especially hurricanes of this category.","Anna Kneser (20%): Even though the Epstein files<br />are being given to lawmakers, it will take longer<br />than November 25th for there to be legislation<br />passed releasing the documents. Historically,<br />it has taken longer than a few months for<br />legislation to pass, and with the hesitancy of<br />some governmental officials like the Speaker of<br />the House and Trump, it will be more difficult<br />than meets the eye. A more realistic expectation<br />for the files would be committee hearings or<br />subpoenas.","Anna Kneser (4%): There has not been a category<br />IV hurricane or higher that has hit Georgia in<br />over 100 years. Even though we are in an unusually<br />active season, I do not think that is enough<br />evidence to persuade me to think a percentage<br />higher than 5%. Logistically, it makes sense<br />to think historically for this forecast, and<br />historically, it is highly unlikely. These types<br />of hurricanes are more likely to hit the Carolinas<br />or Florida.","Arshia Charkhian (35%): The Epstein controversy<br />has become a bipartisan concern, and recently,<br />many of Trump’s supporters have questioned the<br />administration over his attempts to withhold the<br />files, especially in light of the promises he made<br />during his campaign. This will keep pressure high,<br />but given the systemic and logistical constraints<br />for releasing the Epstein files by November 25,<br />I would forecast a 35% chance that they will be<br />released.","Breanne Talley (25%): I don’t think that Congress<br />will pass legislation to release any of the files<br />publicly. They have already passed a vote not to<br />even let the matter on the floor. They are also<br />currently on a recess until September. When they<br />get back to meet the deadline of November 25th, it<br />would have to be one of the first things that they<br />plan to see. Since it will also be right before<br />the beginning of the fiscal year, the National<br />Budget will take priority before anything, so that<br />there is not a government shutdown.","Caleb Lux (25%): I find it unlikely that Congress<br />will vote to release any of the Epstein files,<br />but this issue has the potential to change<br />significantly without any warning or pretext.<br />Unless Trump's opposition to their release changes<br />(unlikely), the Republican-controlled chambers<br />will not vote to do so, irrespective of any public<br />sentiment. This issue will turn into a generic<br />punch line for Democrats where there will be a<br />waning opposition against the immovable force of<br />a majority that doesn't want to act on anything<br />related to Epstein. But who knows?","Caleb Lux (2%): There is an incredibly low chance<br />that a hurricane of this intensity will hit<br />Georgia by the end of the semester. While we will<br />likely bare the wrath of intense storms and the<br />remnants of some hurricanes, any category IV or<br />V storm will likely dissipate in the Gulf and on<br />Florida before reaching Georgia. Even last year<br />with Hurricane Helene, it made landfall on Florida<br />as a Category IV but reduced significantly into a<br />cat-2 by the time it got here.","Caroline Mattox (35%): I do not foresee Congress<br />passing any legislation to get the Epstein files<br />released before November 25th. Like many people<br />said in their briefings, the process to have these<br />documents released is extremely lengthy and it<br />is not something that just happens overnight. I<br />believe there is also not enough willingness to<br />push for these documents to be released for them<br />to actually be released before November 25th.","Caroline Mattox (45%): It is hard for me to<br />go above 45% for this topic because as stated<br />in class, we have not seen a hurricane of this<br />caliber hit the state of Georgia in quite awhile<br />and it would definitely be an abnormal occurrence.<br />Because of this, I just do not see it happening<br />this year. But there is also a part of me that<br />wants to think it could happen because the weather<br />has become so much more intense over the past<br />several years.","Chris Haswell (40%): I am leaning towards no,<br />simply because the President has done everything<br />in his power to suppress Congress from releasing<br />the Epstein Files. Previous motions to even<br />discuss the release have been vetoed, making<br />official legislation by November a long shot.<br />However I am not confident in this prediction,<br />simply because Epstein has become a media<br />firestorm and rallying cry for Democrats. Even<br />Republicans realize the seriousness of the<br />situation. On August 25, House Oversight Chair<br />James Comer subpoenaed the Epstein estate, citing<br />the federal government's \"mismanagement\" of the<br />case. Nevertheless, I think any revelations will<br />not come from legislation but from executive or<br />committee action. I believe Trump has too much<br />control over his party to let them handle a<br />scandal of this magnitude .","Chris Haswell (6%): I might be less confident than<br />most that a hurricane won't hit Georgia, mainly<br />because changing weather patterns make hurricane<br />predictions more difficult. That being said, it<br />seems extremely unlikely that a Cat IV will hit<br />given the NOAA data and the fact that a Cat IV<br />hurricane hasn't hit Georgia in over 100 years.","Blake Martin (35%): I gave this probability<br />a 35% because Congress shut down early to<br />avoid addressing the Epstein situation. The<br />administration says that there is no client list<br />and that they have reviewed the files and have<br />not found things verifying conspiracy theories<br />surrounding Epstein. If what the things said about<br />are true, the Epstein files will impact both major<br />figures in political parties. It is unlikely that<br />Congress, under the Trump administration, will<br />continue to take strides and accountability on<br />this issue when they have said prior that things<br />are all clear and they've given their explanation.<br />I gave it a little bit more percent however<br />because Republicans might feel pressure from<br />their home districts, or social media might form<br />a coalition vote with the democrats to pressure<br />Congress to pass legislation.","Blake Martin (5%): I said that the probability of<br />there being a category 4 hurricane making landfall<br />in Georgia before November 25 was 5%. We have<br />not had direct landfall in Georgia for decades<br />and a lot of that has to do with the shape of the<br />Georgia coast and the way the hurricanes curve.<br />Hurricanes often lose strength when they move<br />northward, especially when meeting with colder<br />waters so I believe there is an incredibly low<br />percentage for their to be a category 4 hurricane<br />hitting landfall in Georgia. I gave it 5% though<br />because at the end of the day you never know and<br />weather can change rapidly.","Cierra Green (30%): Due to Trump's involvement<br />with the Epstein Files and the allegations against<br />him, it is against the interest of Republicans to<br />release information that may affect the reputation<br />of their party. With a House and Senate Republican<br />majority, it would be very difficult to pass this<br />legislation. Additionally, with ongoing trials<br />and the necessity to review these files prior to<br />release, it is unlikely this would occur before<br />November 25th. Although I believe a release<br />will occur at some point, this is too soon of a<br />deadline.","Cierra Green (1%): Due to the positioning of<br />Georgia, it is extremely difficult for category<br />4+ hurricanes to make landfall. Typically, a<br />hurricane must pass through land to reach Georgia.<br />As a hurricane reaches land, the wind speeds<br />drop dramatically. Therefore, a hurricane is most<br />likely going to be less than a category 4 once it<br />hits Georgia. Additionally, there has only been 1<br />recorded Category 4+ hurricane in Georgia, which<br />occurred in 1898. Although there are expected to<br />be above normal conditions this year, I do not<br />believe a category 4+ hurricane in Georgia will be<br />a result. Rather, this may result in a category 3<br />at best.","Elizabeth Nelson (3%): I focused on the historical<br />rarity of major hurricane landfalls in Georgia and<br />the changing risk of environment due to climate<br />change and this year's unusually active Atlantic<br />hurricane outlook. The size and shape of Georgia's<br />coast has shielded it from the brunt of major<br />hurricanes. Given the statistics of previous<br />hurricanes that have hit Georgia and since only<br />one has been recorded as a Category 4, I would<br />say that it is highly unlikely. It is worth<br />considering that this hurricane season is supposed<br />to be extremely active, but there are external<br />factors worth considering like what states are<br />doing on the ground to prepare, the defunding of<br />the NOAA, and comparing analog years like 2005<br />and 2020 which were also active hurricane seasons<br />where Georgia was spared.","Ellie Null (5%): After researching this<br />forecasting question, I am 95% confident that<br />there will not be a hurricane 4 (or above).<br />since the last hurricane that had this high level<br />category was in 1898. furthermore, due to the<br />structure of Georgias Coast and the dynamics of<br />hurricane winds, the hurricanes that do occur this<br />season will hit the Carolinas or Florida. However,<br />I am stay at a 5% chance due to the fact that<br />there is supposed to an extra active season this<br />year and climate change could alter the normal<br />statistics.","Francesca Mariano (10%): Many Americans and<br />members of Congress feel strongly about the<br />release of the Epstein files. Despite this<br />resulting in many members of Congress from both<br />sides of the aisle publicly calling for the<br />release and introducing bipartisan legislation<br />for the release of the files, I do not see them<br />demonstrating great fervor to bring the seven<br />different resolutions to a vote, and those that<br />are, seemingly, lack political clout. Congress<br />is also currently in recess, preventing us from<br />analyzing the current state of their stance on<br />this issue legislatively. Also, seeing as Congress<br />is already gaining access to the files through<br />the House Oversight Committee's subpoena, leads<br />me to believe that they will deem legislation<br />unnecessary at this point in time. What I am<br />not sure to believe is whether, after initial<br />transmittance of the files, Congress will be<br />satisfied enough with this arrangement to not turn<br />to legislation. Public prediction forums also have<br />it being extremely unlikely, currently sitting<br />at negative one percent, that the House will pass<br />legislation publicly releasing the files. This<br />information all together leads me to believe that<br />Congress will not pass legislation to publicly<br />release the Epstein files before November 25<br />and that the percentage probability is circling<br />10%. Due to the unpredictable nature of this<br />administration and its effects on Congress, I do<br />not think the probability is simply at zero, but<br />I also believe the probability is still very low,<br />leading me to my previously stated prediction of<br />10%.","Francesca Mariano (3%): Many of the briefs<br />highlighted that a category IV or higher hurricane<br />has not made landfall in Georgia in over 100<br />years, making another one hitting this year highly<br />unlikely. We are lucky enough to have a number<br />of barrier islands and a convex coast, causing<br />many hurricanes to lose momentum before making<br />landfall. Also, Many hurricanes hit Florida first<br />before reaching Georgia, again causing hurricanes<br />to lose momentum. Again, many of the briefs had<br />their probabilities from around 1 to 5%. Given<br />this, I think 3% is a median probability and<br />represents the unlikelihood of a hurricane, but<br />still allows room for the slight chance there may<br />be one (knock on wood).","Ellie Null (20%): I do no think there is a high<br />chance of any part of the files being released by<br />legislation before November 25th. after reviewing<br />all the information and the briefs I have come to<br />the conclusion that there is a lengthy process of<br />evening starting to release one document to the<br />public that they would have already had to have<br />started opening files to dissect them and start<br />the release process. furthermore, congress is in<br />recess right now so it is just highly unlikely<br />that they will release any information. I also<br />think that there are bigger issues at play and<br />that the files will be pushed down the list of<br />importance.","Hunter Murray (48%): I believe, based on the<br />amount of bipartisan support releasing the<br />Epstein files has, that a resolution calling for<br />the limited release of files will be passed in<br />either the Senate or the House within the next<br />couple months. I am pretty confident in this<br />answer, somewhere around 60%, but there is also<br />the distinct possibility that Trump decides to<br />release files himself and that his release stunts<br />any action from Congress. Trump is notoriously<br />unpredictable, but I will put it at a 70% chance<br />that he does not release any Epstein files<br />that stunt an act of Congress. Based on these<br />confidence levels, I end up at a 48% compound<br />probability.","Hunter Murray (2%): Based on Georgia's hurricane<br />history, its protective geographical features,<br />and the relative uncertainty about the El Niño,<br />La Niña, and ENSO-neutral status of the oceans, I<br />think there is an extremely low chance of a major<br />hurricane in GA, with an even lower chance of a<br />hurricane that is a category IV or V.","Jack Lutz (5%): Georgia's coast is nestled between<br />Florida and South Carolina, having only a very<br />short stretch directly exposed to the Atlantic<br />Ocean. Hurricanes dissipate once they make<br />landfall, and almost every hurricane that has hit<br />Georgia since it has been monitored has passed up<br />through Florida, and has thus reduced in category<br />since it is starved of warm ocean water. Only<br />once, back at the end of the 1800s, did a Category<br />4 hurricane make landfall in the State of Georgia,<br />and I am very confident it will not happen this<br />year, but not quite certain.","Jackson Bost (35%): Congress has several hurdles<br />to jump before the release of the Epstein Files<br />is close to reality. If there is renewed effort<br />to release the Files, the votes won't be there.<br />In the House, 6/9 who abstained on the previous<br />Epstein Files vote would likely vote against<br />any new proposal due to either needing Trump's<br />support in the 2026 midterms or their growing role<br />alongside his administration, leaving only two in<br />any position to vote for it. Senate Republicans<br />also hold a comfortable majority, with few<br />expected to defect over fear of Trump.","Jackson Bost (5%): Although the National Oceanic<br />and Atmospheric Administration expects this<br />hurricane season to be above average and their<br />tracking systems are underfunded, the odds are<br />not in favor of a Category 4 or greater hurricane<br />striking Georgia. There is a century-long<br />precedent against Cat 4s, unfavorable geography,<br />and unworried conditions in our coastal<br />communities, warranting a minimal probability of<br />5.","James Hunter Darke (40%): No I don’t think the<br />Trump administration has any desire or to release<br />them. I could see them being released if public<br />pressure becomes too high, but public pressure<br />is already high and they keep pushing it off.<br />If there seemed to be any sort of progress on<br />releasing the files my answer would be different.","Jhaycee Barnes (15%): There’s bipartisan push<br />and public pressure to release the files, but<br />leadership is blocking it and DOJ is already<br />handing over redacted files. Additionally,<br />Congress almost never moves this fast on<br />transparency bills, discharge petitions don't<br />succeed most of the time, and scandals like this<br />are usually not handled with legislation.","Jhaycee Barnes (2%): Georgia’s coastline is small,<br />and in history there’s basically only been one<br />direct Cat 4 landfall here (in 1898). This year’s<br />season is active with several big storms out<br />there, but the chances of one lining up perfectly<br />to hit Georgia as a category 4 are super slim.","Kira Fleischer (15%): Historically, it is rare<br />that legislation leading to the release of the<br />Epstein files is able to be passed. However, there<br />is definitely still a chance that legislation is<br />passed by the House. All in all, I am just not<br />confident that Congress will pass any legislation<br />before the quick deadline of November 25th.","Kira Fleischer (2%): Analyzing Georgia's history,<br />Georgia has not seen a category IV hurricane in<br />decades, and recent years have not shown any clear<br />hints of any looming. Despite the fact that this<br />hurricane season is expected to be worse than<br />past ones, a category IV hurricane is rare, and<br />Georgia's geography makes it extremely likely that<br />any hurricane will weaken to below Category IV by<br />the time it reaches the state.","Kristoffer Fields (15%): I predict there to be a<br />15 percent chance that Congress will release an<br />Epstein file because I find the likelihood of it<br />occurring extremely unlikely due to the ammount of<br />barriers to releasing the file and the fact that<br />if an executive order is placed it still will not<br />count for the question since it explicitly says<br />congress.","Kristoffer Fields (10%): It will not have a<br />cateogry IV hurricane this fall. I did my briefing<br />assignment on this topic and the statistical<br />probability of it occurring is very low even when<br />accounting for confounding variables like El Niño<br />and La Niña currents and rising sea temperatures.<br />I argue there is a less than 5 percent chance<br />that a CAT IV comes to Georgia if the question<br />where phrases as “will a hurricane make landfall<br />in georgia” the answer may be different but the<br />parameter of it being a CAT IV makes it rare.","Liz Yancey (5%): The chances of Congress passing<br />legislation to release the Epstein files are<br />pretty slim. Even though it appears to be a<br />bipartisan issue, the Republicans still control<br />both the House and the Senate, meaning that<br />if legislation is proposed, it probably won't<br />even pass cloture. This is because there are<br />still Republican representatives who are afraid<br />of being disloyal to their party and the Trump<br />administration. I think it also depends on whether<br />anything more interesting happens in the news<br />between now and Nov. 25.","Liz Yancey (5%): I read through the briefings<br />and agreed with them. I think the geography of<br />the coastline protects Georgia from hurricanes<br />and other natural disasters than less shielded<br />surrounding states. Elizabeth highlighted that<br />even the strongest hurricane that impacted Georgia<br />did not make landfall in the state. Instead, it<br />directly hit Florida first and was also weakened<br />by the time it reached Georgia. However, this<br />being an extremely active hurricane season<br />indicates that there will be more Category 4+<br />hurricanes. Due to Georgia's coastline being so<br />short, the probability that a strong hurricane<br />hits the coast is still unlikely, considering<br />that historically, those hurricanes do not make<br />landfall in Georgia first and weaken by the time<br />they reach the coast.","Manuv Datta (40%): No, Congress will not release<br />information on the Epstein files before November<br />25th. As Speaker Mike Johnson has recently gone<br />to the lengths of even shutting down and putting<br />the House in Recess until September, I believe<br />any further investigative information on Epstein<br />would incriminate far too many powerful and<br />wealthy individuals, who are likely going to great<br />lengths to protect themselves. If any information<br />is released, it will likely be highly doctored<br />and redacted, however I see this as also very<br />unlikely.","Manuv Datta (5%): I make this prediction rooted<br />in data depicting the very rare occurrences of<br />category 4 or above hurricanes hitting Georgia.<br />The path of how air flows in the Atlantic<br />naturally shifts almost all tropical storms<br />either towards Florida or further northeast. While<br />there is increasing unpredictably due to climate<br />change, the reality is that hurricanes dissipate<br />upon landfall fairly quickly. And as a strong<br />category 4 or stronger hurricane is almost sure<br />to hit Florida first, there is an extremely high<br />probability that if a hurricane does hit this<br />year, it will likely weaken below a category 4<br />before it reaches Georgia.","Mateo Ceron (33%): Because this has been a very<br />pressing issue since even the campaigns for the<br />2024 election, I believe that the release of<br />ANY file relating to the Epstein investigation<br />will happen before November 25th. However, the<br />more interesting part of the question, and the<br />part that has caused me the most indecision, is<br />whether Congress will pass legislation or not. I<br />think it is very likely that the administration<br />will release at least some less incriminating<br />documents to appease some of the president's more<br />loyal followers, which bypasses the need for any<br />legislation. However, there is the off-chance that<br />a couple of House Republicans decide to change<br />their minds, which could lead to a proposal making<br />it's way to the floor. But, I believe that the<br />off-chance is a very small one, so for that reason<br />I am giving the probability for Congress passing<br />legislation to release the \"Epstein files\" a 33%<br />chance.","Mateo Ceron (4%): I gave this weeks question a<br />4% chance of coming true. Georgia has not had<br />a Category IV hurricane make landfall since<br />1898. Although this hurricane season is expected<br />to be more active than the past couple of<br />years, meteorologists (and a couple of head of<br />departments here at UGA) are confident that even<br />if a hurricane does make landfall here in Georgia,<br />it will not be a Cat. 4.","Nic Curtis (35%): While I think that it is<br />possible for some part of the files to be<br />released, I think it is more likely to not for a<br />few reasons. Trump and Republicans did campaign<br />on the promise to release the files, but have<br />since switched their response, especially Trump.<br />I believe that Trump has too much hold over<br />congressional Republicans to where they will<br />not do something he does not want done. This is<br />evident with speaker Mike Johnson calling for<br />an early recess to stop a vote. Even if a vote<br />does occur, it may take months for congressional<br />committees to look over the files.","Nic Curtis (3%): While many of the briefings<br />suggest that this year could be a more active<br />hurricane season, a Category IV hurricane has<br />not made impact with the state since the 1890s.<br />This, combined with the fact that the shape of<br />Georgia's coastline usually deters Hurricanes from<br />hitting the state head on means that a category<br />V hurricane would need to make landfall in the<br />Florida panhandle in order for it to impact<br />Georgia at a cat IV.","Owen Johnston (20%): Based upon the time<br />constraints it would take for a law to make its<br />way through Congress by November 25th and the lack<br />of support from Republican leadership, including<br />the House Speaker and President Trump, I predict<br />it is unlikely that Congress passes legislation to<br />publicly release the Epstein files before November<br />25th. However, if public pressure continues to<br />be placed on Congress and they can fast track a<br />narrow bill to release some of the files, there<br />is a possibility that Congress could do so before<br />November 25th, however, I believe this is less<br />likely than Congress failing to pass a bill.<br />Because of this, I give a probability of 20% that<br />Congress will pass legislation to publicly release<br />the Epstein files before November 25th.","Owen Johnston (1%): Given the rare historical<br />instances (only two times since the 1890s) and<br />Georgia's geographical advantages which keep<br />it from receiving strong hurricanes, I give a<br />1% probability that a Category IV (or higher)<br />hurricane hits Georgia before November 25.","Paul Frilingos (52%): I'm very unsure about<br />whether this will happen. I can't find anything<br />about congress forcing action by the Justice<br />Department in the past. However, the political<br />pressure to release the Epstein files is very<br />great. Surveys show that 82% of Americans want<br />them to be released. All democrats need is six<br />republicans to join them and I think the pressure<br />might be there. The discharge petition can allow<br />them to get around the House Rules Committee,<br />which the democratic minority has done several<br />times in the past few years against the very slim<br />republican majority. However, there's definitely a<br />question of whether that pressure will still exist<br />when congress returns in september, and whether<br />the files might be released separately from<br />congress.","Paul Frilingos (0%): I don't believe it's<br />possible. Georgia's location, with Florida in the<br />way and the convex coastline, make a hurricane as<br />strong as a category four effectively impossible.<br />It apparently happened once in 1898, which seems<br />to be a fluke. In recent times, when weather data<br />is presumably more reliable, it hasn't come close<br />to occurring. Ultimately, if a category four storm<br />does hit Georgia we may have more things to worry<br />about.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (25%): I think<br />there is a 25% chance that Congress will pass<br />legislation to publicly release the Epstein files<br />before November 25. There is clear bipartisan<br />interest and several active proposals (H.Res.577,<br />H.R.4405, S.2557), but leadership signals are<br />mixed. Other factors working against this are the<br />limited time frame and the complex legal issues<br />involved in document release. Privacy/redaction<br />issues also slow things down.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (3%): I am<br />about 3% confident that a Category IV or higher<br />hurricane could hit Georgia before November 25<br />because history shows it is extremely rare. The<br />last Category IV hurricane to hit Georgia was on<br />1898, almost 127 years ago. A Category 4 hurricane<br />has winds of 130 to 156 mph. The peak of hurricane<br />season combined with very warm Atlantic waters<br />makes powerful storms likely this year, but most<br />major hurricanes usually curve into Florida,<br />the Carolinas, or out to sea instead of striking<br />Georgia. So, when the hurricanes hit Georgia, they<br />are usually a lower category.","Reese Fabritius (17%): Like some of the briefing<br />already covered, this has become an increasingly<br />politicized issue. Because of President Trump's<br />alleged ties to Epstein, I do not think that a<br />Republican controlled House and Senate would vote<br />to release potentially incriminating documents<br />about their party leader. However, public outcries<br />for information may contribute to the release of<br />some, but not all, documents, given that some are<br />under legal protection from release.","Reese Fabritius (4%): Although warmer ocean<br />temperatures and predictions for an active<br />weather season have been made, I do not think<br />that there is any significant chance of a Category<br />4 hurricane hitting Georgia. The last Cat 4<br />to hit Georgia was almost 130 years ago, and I<br />believe our curved coast and strategic geographic<br />positioning behind Florida will continue to<br />protect us.","Ruhi Doddamani (25%): Congress, as an institution,<br />and with the ideological spread that sits its isle<br />now, won't get anything done. We're lucky if any<br />bill gets passed without significant gridlock and<br />legislative tangles. A hot topic like the Epstein<br />Files especially, what with Trump's tie to them,<br />won't get the Republicans to vote with any kind<br />of commitment of support. I didn't forecast a<br />complete 0%, however, because the public is pretty<br />ramped up about this and it's pretty bipartisan,<br />so with adequate pressure, Congress could squeeze<br />something through. Getting it by before November,<br />though?","Ruhi Doddamani (5%): 5%. One, because the last one<br />that has ever managed to maintain that strength<br />all the way to Georgia's coast was back in 1898.<br />Two, if there was a case to be made around global<br />warming and climate conditions changing to make<br />it more likely, the phase of El Niño currents that<br />we're in lowers the chances anyway. A hurricane<br />wouldn't be able to keep up from hitting landfall<br />at Cat V or IV and still being in that range by<br />the time it gets to GA, so the only consideration<br />would be if it strikes on GA's already very<br />limited coastline, and that concave shape<br />already discourages touchdown that isn't past the<br />Florida/S Carolina borders.","Ryan Marx (10%): I believe that there is only a 10<br />percent chance of Congress releasing the Epstein<br />files before November 25th. The first reason for<br />me believing this is because of the stagnation of<br />current legislation to secure the files release.<br />Both the house of representatives(H.res 577) and<br />senate bill 2557 have both requested the immediate<br />release of all documents related to Jeffery<br />Epstein and Ghislane maxwell. However both have<br />stalled in their respective chambers, and with<br />october being the earliest that a new session can<br />be called to push them further the less likely it<br />is that the files will be released in the small<br />window. The other issue effecting this probability<br />is the current political climate within congress,<br />with the upcoming midterm elections in 2026 as<br />well as the political donors and some of the<br />politicians themselves having some connections<br />to Epstein, neither side wishes to give their<br />opposing parties any ammunition to use against<br />them. It is these facts that lead me to believe<br />that there is only around a 10% chance of congress<br />releasing the Epstein files before november 25th.","Ryan Marx (3%): I believe that there is only<br />around a 3 percent chance of a hurricane making<br />landfall in Georgia as a category four. One of<br />the Biggest Reasons for this is that the last<br />time a category 4 or higher hurricane hit Georgia<br />was back in 1896, all subsequent Hurricanes that<br />have made landfall were category 2s and 3s. The<br />closest that any hurricane has came since then<br />is Hurricane Helen in 2024 which hit Florida as<br />a category 4 but died down to a category 2 by the<br />time it Hit Georgia. Furthermore, the reason that<br />so many category 4 hurricanes die down before<br />making landfall in Georgia is because of the<br />states Geography, the trajectory of most of the<br />hurricanes moving up from the Caribbean curve to<br />the north, hitting Florida and losing momentum<br />before making landfall in Georgia, furthermore<br />its coastline bending inwards means that even if<br />the weakened hurricanes make it past Florida, they<br />are most likely to only pass through Georgia's<br />coastal waters. It is with this information that I<br />believe that there is only a 3 percent chance of a<br />category 4 hurricane making landfall in Georgia.","Sade Ezekiel (35%): There is a 35% chance that<br />Congress will pass legislation to publicly<br />release the “Epstein files” before November 25th.<br />Jeffrey Epstein was said to have hung himself<br />while he was in Federal holding. There are many<br />sources that say that Epstein did commit suicide;<br />however, I believe that Jeffrey Epstein did not<br />commit suicide and that he was murdered while<br />in holding. I believe that in the Epstein files,<br />there are high amounts of incriminating evidence<br />against our current president, Donald J Trump. I<br />am very confident that congress will not release<br />these files due to the fact that most of the<br />representatives in congress are Republicans and<br />act in Donald J. Trump's best interest.","Sade Ezekiel (3%): I believe that there is a<br />3% chance that a category IV hurricane will hit<br />Georgia. Many meteorologists say that we will<br />have an above average rain weather season. There<br />hasn't been a category IV hurricane that has hit<br />Georgia in almost 127 years. All of our hurricanes<br />in the past have come from beneath us in Florida,<br />and when the hurricane collected in Georgia the<br />category decreased due to the land and hills. We<br />also have a curved coastline, so the probability<br />of a category IV hurricane hitting Georgia is very<br />low.","Sarah Kate Maher (25%): Congress is out of session<br />until September. And the House Oversight Committee<br />still needs to go through thousands of pages<br />of the files and then reach a vote on releasing<br />the files. Even then, the DOJ hasn't given the<br />Oversight Committee all of the documents yet.<br />If the committee somehow got through all of the<br />files, and it was up to Congress to vote, it would<br />probably not pass, as some members of Congress<br />have hinted at opposition to releasing the files.","Sarah Kate Maher (15%): The last time a Category<br />4 hurricane hit Georgia was in 1898. In order for<br />a Category 4 hurricane to hit Georgia, it would<br />have to defy the historical pattern of hurricanes<br />first hitting Florida or another close area and<br />then moving up to Georgia. And with that pattern,<br />hurricanes lose a lot of their power after making<br />landfall in a neighboring state, lessening them to<br />a tropical storm or a lower category hurricane. By<br />the time one of these storms would hit Georgia (if<br />they even did due to the curve of the coastline),<br />they would not be at the strength of a Category 4<br />storm.","Sasha Mahtani (16%): Based on the parameters of<br />the question specifying whether Congress pass the<br />legislation, I gave a relatively low probability<br />that the process of releasing the Epstein files<br />will happen so soon. As we discussed in class, the<br />House or Representatives and Senate remain largely<br />republican. If we look at this as a party issue,<br />one can argue that the files have a low chance<br />of being released by Congress, as republicans<br />voted against the motion of releasing the files.<br />November 25th is only three months away, which<br />is a notably short period of time in terms of<br />Congress passing legislation.","Sasha Mahtani (40%): Hurricane Ferdinand is<br />currently being tracked for moving eastward,<br />so away from Georgia which leads me to believe<br />there is a lower chance that a hurricane will hit<br />us before November 25th. According to CBS news,<br />Ferdinand is expected to move across open waters<br />of the subtropical Atlantic ocean. While Georgia<br />may have a higher probability of having tropical<br />storms or even lower category hurricanes, I think<br />its safe to say that there is a less than 50<br />percent probability of a category IV (or higher)<br />hurricane will hit Georgia.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (12%): A vote already took place<br />in July 2025 in Congress on whether the Trump<br />administration should be ordered to release the<br />\"Epstein files\". 211 votes against the release,<br />all Republican, against the 210 for it, made it<br />crystal clear this is a party issue. As long as<br />Republicans are in the majority for the House of<br />Representatives and the Senate, and likely no one<br />stands to lose more from a release of the Epstein<br />files than Donald Trump, we may not see a release<br />of the Epstein files as long as Trump is president<br />and the Republican party controls Congress.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (1%): There is virtually no<br />chance that this is the year a Category IV or<br />higher hurricane will make landfall in Georgia.<br />The last time this happened was over 120 years<br />ago, and no significant changes have occurred to<br />make this year any different. Hurricanes rarely<br />make landfall in Georgia at all, and the ones<br />that do weaken to Category 2 or 3. This is due<br />to the curvature of Georgia’s coast, its smaller<br />coastline, and the transition to land that<br />naturally weakens hurricanes as the warm water is<br />key to the storm’s strength.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (3%): I selected 3% to<br />reflect the extreme rarity of a Category 4<br />or higher hurricane making direct landfall in<br />Georgia, a fact supported by a limited historical<br />record. While the 2025 season is predicted<br />to be \"above normal\" due to factors like very<br />warm Atlantic waters and an active West African<br />Monsoon, this does not translate to a higher<br />probability of a specific Georgia landfall. The<br />season's ENSO-neutral state means neither El<br />Niño's suppressing nor La Niña's enhancing effects<br />are a factor. The state's barrier islands also<br />provide a natural buffer, and the overall track of<br />storms is highly unpredictable. Therefore, while<br />the Atlantic basin may be active, I anticipate<br />Georgia's coast will remain a low-probability<br />target.","Zafar Ali (15%): Based on the current Trump<br />administration, there is a very low chance that<br />there will much action when it comes to releasing<br />anything regarding the Epstein files. Currently,<br />Congress is in recess and even if anything were<br />to come out now, there is already enough suspicion<br />that proves as evidence for those who believe<br />Donald Trump is guilty of wrongdoing in relation<br />to his long relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.<br />There are also Trump's longtime supporters who<br />will stand by him regardless of the information<br />brought out. Because of this, there probably is<br />not much of a reason for many to want to have<br />these files released to the public. Some in the<br />Republican party have called for action to be made<br />for transparency, but it is likely that nothing<br />much if anything at all will happen from now to<br />November 25th since that seems to be too short<br />of a time frame. I also put 15% for the reason<br />that it is not relying on everything to come out<br />but at least something so that pushes the chances<br />slightly further to more possible than not.","Zafar Ali (1%): For this forecast, it is very<br />unlikely to see a major hurricane in Georgia. The<br />last category 4 hurricane that made landfall in<br />Georgia occurred in 1898 which shows that there<br />is a small probability of any major threats. Many<br />hurricanes also tend to curve in a way that forces<br />them to move through Florida or other areas first<br />so by the time they reach Georgia, there is little<br />to no impact."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.25,0.040000000000000001],"y":[1.992908212938346,0.98586038732901216],"text":["Crowd (25%)","Crowd (4%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.080000000000000002,0.050000000000000003],"y":[1.9518294526729734,1.0067019257228822],"text":["Joe Ornstein (8%): As first approximation, if the<br />question is \"will Congress pass X legislation?\"<br />the answer is almost always no.

Out of 134 discharge petitions filed<br />this century, only *two* have led to a bill being<br />passed without the Speaker's support. That's a<br />base rate of 1.5% for this sort of thing. Given<br />the ongoing salience of the issue, I'm going to<br />generously multiply that base rate by a factor of<br />five.","Joe Ornstein (5%): Over the past 20 hurricane<br />seasons, there have been six years when a<br />Cat IV storm hit the mainland US. In two<br />of those cases--Helene (2024) & Michael<br />(2018)---the hurricane crossed into Georgia<br />as a significantly-dissipated Cat II. We are<br />geographically-blessed with a short, convex<br />coastline buffered by a much longer state to the<br />south. That plus the fact that Atlantic hurricanes<br />tend to turn clockwise means that an unlikely<br />sequence of events has to happen before we're hit<br />by a Cat IV or higher.

So, even though I think<br />it has a strong chance of winning, I will stay<br />slightly skeptical and place my probability on the<br />lower-end of the winning side.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (75%): Based on the criteria<br />for a television series to win awards for<br />outstanding drama series along with the popularity<br />of the series within in media, severence presents<br />a significantly good chance of winning the<br />Outstanding series. Additionally the series has<br />a impressive amount of nominations for various<br />aspects of the series, typically series that have<br />had the same amount of nomincations for various<br />categories tend to win the main awards such<br />as outstanding series such as Game of Thrones.<br />Although the series has good competition such as<br />The Pitt, Severence has served to be an academy<br />favorite which poses a great chance for the series<br />to win the Outstanding series award.","Alizah Mudaliar (68%): I believe there is a<br />68% chance of Severance winning the Emmy for<br />Outstanding Drama Series for three reasons:<br />historical trends, industry momentum, and<br />competition. The show has 27 total Emmy<br />nominations and 10 major nominations. Typically,<br />shows that earn the most Emmy nominations are<br />awarded Outstanding Drama Series including Game<br />of Thrones, Succession, The Crown, and Shōgun.<br />Television Academy also views Severance as one<br />of the most significant dramas streaming today.<br />There is competition for the award from shows<br />like The Pitt, The Last of Us, and Andor; however,<br />Severance has support across the board for its<br />cinematography, character acting, and technical<br />areas. There is unpredictability in the voting<br />process for the Emmy awards, creating uncertainty<br />of who will win, which lowers the odds of<br />Severance winning the award.","Amanda Neighbour (70%): Sitting at 27 nominations,<br />Severance stands a pretty solid chance of winning<br />the Outstanding Drama Emmy. Historically, the<br />highest amount of nominations usually correlates<br />with winning the Emmy. The other plausible<br />competition predicted by experts is The Pitt,<br />however, this show has half as many nominations<br />and is only one season. Severance has been<br />nominated before, but as the show has evolved<br />through more seasons, it has a higher chance of<br />winning. Severance has a lot of buzz surrounding<br />the shows, and this is something I observed as I<br />has not heard any raving reviews or talks about<br />its competitions. However, it is an Apple TV<br />series, which may make it as popular as series<br />from Netflix or other platforms. The show itself,<br />being a sci-fi/thriller series is culturally<br />relevant and unique through its demonstration of<br />becoming intertwined with technology. This may<br />stick out to the voters more than a show such<br />as The Pitt would, since there are many hospital<br />drama series in existence.","Ana Valencia (85%): Severance has a higher<br />chance at winning the Best Drama Award due to low<br />competition by a fellow contender, The Pitt, as<br />they only have 7 major nominations and 13 total<br />nominations. By contrast, Severance leads the<br />field with 27 nominations, placing it in the same<br />tier as past winners like Succession and Game of<br />Thrones. This disparity indicates that while The<br />Pitt has industry recognition, its comparatively<br />weak nomination profile makes it a statistically<br />unlikely winner when competing against Severance’s<br />broad critical and technical acclaim.","Anna Barton-Caucci (70%): I think because<br />severance has 27 nominations it has a high chance<br />of winning. The main runner up, The Pitt, only<br />has 13 nominations and in general when series<br />are nominated more, they have a higher chance<br />of winning in their categories. I didn't put<br />the probability any higher because Ben Stiller,<br />the director has not had a strong history of<br />award-winning, but I do believe this series in<br />general is doing well and better than his others.","Anna Kneser (70%): Severance has 27 nominations,<br />which shows how widespread its recognition<br />is. Historically, any drama series that have<br />been nominated that much has never lost. More<br />specifically, the show with the highest number<br />of nominations has won Best Drama Series 9 years<br />out of 10. In contrast, Severence's competition,<br />The Pitt, has only received 13 nominations. The<br />website GoldDerby says that The Pitt only has a<br />30% chance of winning as well. However, The Pitt<br />was very emotional, so some voters may have an<br />emotional resonance with this series. That is<br />where this 30% comes from. Ultimately, though, I<br />think Severance has a high chance of winning due<br />to its growing buzz, originality, and amount of<br />nominations it has received.","Arshia Charkhian (90%): Given Severence’s high<br />cultural relevance and 27 nominations, I give<br />it a 90% chance that it will win an Emmy for<br />Outstanding Drama Series. The high number of<br />nominations indicates wide-scale support amongst<br />voters, and the lack of a super high-profile<br />competitor makes it very likely to win.","Blake Martin (68%): I say there is a 68% chance<br />of Severance winning because it has wide success<br />across its two seasons and there was a lot of<br />praise for the new season from critics. The<br />biggest competitor is known to be The Pit but<br />shows that are one season usually have a harder<br />time winning any awards. It also has only had<br />half as many nominations as the Severance. The<br />White Lotus was also possibly a competitor but<br />the momentum of the show and its viewership have<br />declines. However, I am not completely confident<br />because I wouldn't be surprised if things come<br />out and shock us because the awards are subject to<br />academy members and what they vote for.","Breanne Talley (70%): Based on historical data,<br />shows with the most nominations typically win the<br />award for Outstanding Drama Series; Severance has<br />27 Emmy Nominations. There is one notable outlier<br />in this data when The Handmaid's Tale won. Other<br />prediction markets are putting it around 65%. So<br />I feel like with trend analysis and the way others<br />are thinking that it is probable that it will win<br />the Emmy award.","Caleb Lux (71%): Based entirely outside of my<br />prior knowledge, there seems to be a pretty<br />good chance that Severance will win this Emmy.<br />Averaging the probabilities that the discussion<br />leaders gave in their briefings, I got 71%,<br />and this seems pretty reasonable. I want to be<br />fairly cautious due to this question being well<br />outside my expertise, so I will rely on other's<br />assessments.","Caroline Mattox (80%): Severance has some strong<br />competition like The Pitt for example but I think<br />there is a very high chance that Severance will<br />win the Emmy for this category. This show has<br />received a lot of recognition since releasing the<br />latest season. Severance is a very origianl show<br />that definitely fits under this category well and<br />i could definitely see it taking home the Emmy for<br />this category.","Chris Haswell (65%): I am fairly confident that<br />Severance will win the emmy, but I do not think<br />its a shoe in. I am encouraged by the statistic<br />that historically the show with the most<br />nominations wins Outstanding Drama, but I do think<br />Andor is a more culturally relevant show. The fact<br />that Andor ended this year while Severance will<br />continue also increases its chances of winning the<br />emmy this year. While Severance has better odds of<br />winning than the other contenders, I would not be<br />shocked if it does not win.","Cierra Green (75%): When viewing the history<br />of winners for Outstanding Drama Series, these<br />titles typically had the most nominations. With<br />27 nominations, Severance is more likely than<br />not to win this award. Additionally, the second<br />most likely title to win is The Pitt with 13<br />nominations. Having more than double the amount,<br />Severance is more likely to win based on the<br />Emmy's track record. However, this does not<br />guarantee that Severance will win. In 2017, the<br />title with the most nominations did not win.<br />Therefore, it is not impossible for Severance to<br />lose. Since the Emmy's are based on the views of<br />some judges, there is more room for subjectivity<br />and inconsistency. This may be the year they<br />deviate from the norm again; or they may continue<br />giving the award to the title with the most<br />nominations.","Elizabeth Nelson (80%): Considering how many<br />nominations Severance has, acting, writing, and<br />directing (10 Major Nominations) which is tied<br />with White Lotus, since 2019, nine out of ten<br />times, shows with the most nominations tend to win<br />most outstanding. The Handmaid's Tale was the only<br />outlier within the last ten years. I think because<br />Severance has more nominations and because they<br />are not just from \"supporting actors\" like white<br />lotus' majority of nominations. In the context<br />of the competition and the history of the Emmy's,<br />I think Severance has a pretty good chance at<br />winning the Emmy Award.","Francesca Mariano (70%): One of the strongest<br />pieces of evidence to me is the fact that shows<br />with the most Emmy Nominations win the Emmy<br />for outstanding dramas (Handmaid's Tales is<br />the only exception). With Severance having 27<br />overall nominations, this places them as the most<br />nominated. One brief writer brought up the fact<br />that none of the nominations are for acting, and<br />other nominees have a wider range of nominations,<br />raising possible doubts about Severance winning.<br />Many brought up The Pitt as a primary contender,<br />and despite knowing that I shouldn't be basing<br />my forecasts solely on my perception, I have<br />personally not heard any buzz about this show, and<br />I would consider myself very online and tuned in<br />to new media. Probabilities in the briefs range<br />from 68%-88%. Given that Severance is so highly<br />rated, receives a lot of public buzz, and is the<br />most Emmy-nominated, I am confident saying that<br />it is the likely winner. With there being fierce<br />competition and no way to truly gauge what the<br />Television Academy is thinking, there is always a<br />chance for a different show to be selected winner,<br />which leads me to believe the probability of<br />Severance winning is 70%.","Ellie Null (69%): I predict that there is a 69%<br />chance that Severance will win the Emmy Award<br />for Outstanding Drama Series. I have come to<br />the conclusion because severance has 10 major<br />nominations and 4 minor or arts nominations. Those<br />with a lot of nominations or the most nominations<br />have notoriously won Best Drama. However, the<br />runner up in this competition is The Pitts. I<br />have lowered my prediction because of this film,<br />it has a strong subject matter, social relevance<br />and a strong ensemble. It is considered a major<br />contender for this Award. News outlets are<br />placing this series in the “should” or “could” win<br />category. These two shows have individually stood<br />above the rest. They have generated much more<br />critical acclaim and audience engagement too. But<br />again The Pitts has half the nominations compared<br />to Severance. Other contenders like Andor and The<br />White Lotus bring strong cinematic techniques and<br />have emotional plotlines, however their momentum<br />is weaker compared to Severance and The Pitt. In<br />the end, I am fairly confident that there is a<br />strong chane of it winning, but I would not be too<br />surprised if The Pitts ends up being the winner.","Hunter Murray (79%): While some of my classmates<br />were more confident, I took a more cautious route.<br />I think that the there is a level of volitivity<br />that is being ignored (while history of voting and<br />numbers of nominations are being over-emphasized).<br />I also got some help from my film major friends<br />who are out in California, and the overall<br />consensus was that Severance was \"very likely\"<br />(8/10 with the marbles test) to win.","Jack Lutz (81%): Severance has racked up an<br />astounding 27 nominations at the Emmys this year,<br />more than any other, and this is historically a<br />good predictor for winning best drama. Severance<br />has also been a cultural hit, with several<br />relatable themes, something also seen as a<br />positive when selecting the best drama. Finally,<br />its competition is not that strong, with the Pitt<br />seeming to be its main competitor, however, I<br />believe Severance's juggernaut of a nomination<br />spree will help it take home best drama.","Jackson Bost (68%): Severance has a strong<br />chance of winning given some of the historical<br />indicators we have discussed. It currently holds<br />the highest number of nominations across a broad<br />array of categories, making it hard to compete<br />with according to the Emmy's voting guidelines.<br />Its two main sources of competition, The Pitt and<br />The White Lotus, make fair cases but ultimately<br />fall short. In the history of this award, a one<br />season show has only won 15 times, six of those<br />being from 2000 on, giving The Pitt poorer odds.<br />The White Lotus also makes a strong case, but the<br />last time it lost was to Succession, a show that<br />mirrors Severance in its number of nominations and<br />acclaim.","James Hunter Darke (70%): I believe that severance<br />will win the emmy for outstanding drama series.<br />Now this might be a little biased as I have seen<br />the show and it's awesome, but a lot of factors<br />point towards the win. It has the most nominations<br />of any show, and most of the time that show<br />wins. Secondly, while the competition is good,<br />Severance blows these shows out of the water.<br />For a long time the \"innie\" \"outtie\" component of<br />severance was a large social media topic with many<br />discussing their own innies and outties. I fully<br />believe that this show will win the emmy.","Jhaycee Barnes (60%): Severance has become one<br />of the most talked-about shows heading into the<br />Emmys. Critics talk about its creativity and<br />originality compared to other nominees, and the<br />momentum it’s carried since its first season<br />hasn’t slowed down. All of this makes it a strong<br />favorite in the drama category.","Kira Fleischer (84%): Emmy history reveals<br />a direct correlation between the number of<br />nominations received and chances of winning<br />an award. \"Severance\" received a whopping 27<br />nominations, earning its place as the nominations<br />leader by a significant amount. Its greatest<br />competition, \"The Pitt,\" is not predicted as<br />a winner by many journalists, and voters have<br />incentive to reward \"Severance\" considering the<br />defeat its first season faced during the last<br />award ceremony.","Kristoffer Fields (82%): Severance is a critically<br />acclaimed show and has several nominations.<br />Furthermore most of our briefings point towards<br />high probability of it winning something,<br />it has a creative and unique plot line which<br />attracts people from all genres. It also has 27<br />nominations.","Liz Yancey (65%): I thought everyone's points from<br />class today were interesting. I already thought<br />Severance would win because I heard so much buzz<br />about it. Honestly, the only show I've seen that's<br />nominated is White Lotus, and I wasn't even that<br />interested in finishing the newest season. I only<br />watched because I enjoyed the prior seasons, and<br />was interested to see how southern families were<br />represented in modern media. I think Severance<br />is interesting, and I thought the point about<br />how many Emmys they're nominated for and what<br />categories those nominations are in could be a<br />great indicator of whether they win this major<br />category. There's still unpredictability, but<br />overall, I think they have a good chance of<br />winning.","Mateo Ceron (70%): In considering the Emmy<br />process, its criteria, and the competition,<br />Severance appears to have a stronger-than-usual<br />chance of taking home the award for “Outstanding<br />Drama Series.” Its 27 nominations demonstrate<br />broad recognition across nearly every branch of<br />the Television Academy, signaling both artistic<br />and technical respect. Combined with its cultural<br />relevance, timely themes, and critical acclaim,<br />the show has the momentum it lacked in its<br />first season. While contenders like The Pitt<br />and The White Lotus offer real competition, the<br />combination of industry support, originality,<br />and growing buzz makes me believe that Severance<br />has a 70% chance of winning the Emmy award for<br />“Outstanding Drama Series”.","Nic Curtis (65%): I think severance has a very<br />decent chance at winning the Emmy award for<br />Outstanding Drama series for a few reasons. For<br />one, over the past decade, the tv show with the<br />most Emmy nominations won. the Outstanding Drama<br />series 9 out 10 of the years. Furthermore, those<br />who are in writers in the field, such as Gold<br />Derby Surveying, give the chance of Severance<br />earning the award between a 60-70% chance. Stiff<br />competition from the Pitt and Andor may split the<br />vote, but these series lack other nominations in<br />acting which is part of the criteria in nomination<br />for this specific award.","Paul Frilingos (74%): This was the conclusion<br />I reached in my briefing, and I’m sticking with<br />it. I’m a little more confident than the experts<br />at GoldDerby who are at 70% because I think<br />the history just shows that severance’s many<br />nominations make it strong favorite. I’m not going<br />to go higher because there is always the chance of<br />an upset, as occurred in 2017 with the handmaid’s<br />tale, but I’m fairly confident.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (73%): Severance<br />leads all shows with 27 total nominations, tying<br />for the second most total nominations for a drama<br />series of all time. The show’s themes of identity<br />and corporate power also feel timely and resonate<br />with voters. The Pitt and The White Lotus poses<br />a threat to Severance’s chances. But, combined<br />with its cultural relevance, timely themes, and<br />critical acclaim, the Severance has the momentum<br />it lacked in its first season. Therefore, I would<br />say Severance has about a 73% chance of winning<br />Outstanding Drama Series.","Reese Fabritius (80%): After reading some of<br />the briefings, I think severance has a very good<br />chance of winning the Emmy. It has generated a<br />lot of buzz and I just don’t think that there is<br />another series that would take its spot. Severance<br />has done better in the media and I believe will<br />continue on its run as the most highly regarded<br />drama.","Ruhi Doddamani (67%): The uncertainty comes from<br />the Academy's proclivity to snub really good<br />shows. Most variables point in Severance's favor,<br />but I just met a few people who had never heard of<br />the show, when I'd previously though it was like<br />the Game of Thrones of the year, so I'll temper<br />the prediction.","Ryan Marx (65%): I believe that there is<br />approximately a 65% chance that Severance will<br />win the Emmy Award for outstanding drama series<br />for a number of reasons. The first reason is<br />that Severance alone is leading the award show<br />with 27 nominations across both major and minor<br />categories, the most out of any show this year<br />including Outstanding drama series, outstanding<br />Lead actor/Actress, and outstanding Supporting<br />actor/actress. While the second most nominated<br />show the Pitt, has only received 13 nominations.<br />The sheer volume of other awards alongside<br />outstanding drama suggests a high probability<br />in winning the award. Furthermore, the second<br />season of the show which was released just this<br />year received overwhelming praise for its final<br />episode, \"cold harbor\" which currently sits at<br />a 9.4 on IMDB, one of the highest rated episodes<br />of the series, compared to its closest competitor<br />in the category \"The Pitt\" who's season finale<br />\"9:00\" sits at only a 9.1. Lastly, looking at<br />current bets placed on the Emmy's, Severance has<br />a 2 in 3 chance of taking the award according to<br />DraftKings, which roughly translates to around<br />65%. All of these factors combined is why I<br />believe that Severance has around a 65% chance of<br />winning the Emmey for outstanding drama series.","Sade Ezekiel (68%): I believe that that severance<br />will win the Emmy award for outstanding drama<br />series. This is because Severance has gained of<br />publicity in the 3 years that it has been aired.<br />In the history of Severance it has won 2 Emmys in<br />season 1 under outstanding main title design and<br />outstanding music composition for a series. It<br />is really predictive that a show will win based<br />on how many Emmy nominations they have. Severance<br />has 27 total Emmy nominations and 10 major Emmy<br />nominations.","Sarah Kate Maher (60%): Severance has the most<br />nominations out of any of the other Emmy-nominated<br />works. It has a wider viewership and greater<br />overall engagement than The White Lotus, the<br />Last of Us, and Andor. Just based on the public<br />sentiments online after the release of the most<br />recent season, I'm confident that Severance will<br />win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.","Sasha Mahtani (74%): The reason I believe<br />Severance has a more than probable chance of<br />winning the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama<br />Series as they hold the higher number of<br />nominations compared to its main competitor, \"The<br />Pit\". Severance holds 27 nominations while The<br />Pit holds 13 total nominations. In the past, tv<br />shows with more nominations have a higher success<br />rate in winning the overall award. The themes of<br />the t.v. show are socially relevant and critically<br />acclaimed which leads me to believe there is a 74%<br />probability they will win.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (75%): It's no secret that<br />American entertainment awards, particularly<br />the \"Big 4\", have sometimes given priority to<br />what's most popular, not what's best. That works<br />in Severance's favor, as it is by far the most<br />popular show nominated for Outstanding Drama<br />Series. Popularity aside, Severance Season 2 has<br />received 27 nominations across various categories,<br />the most of any show and not far from the world<br />record, and these factors combined prove it more<br />than likely Severance will take home the award for<br />Outstanding Drama Series.","Zafar Ali (65%): The first thing I think of when<br />it comes to this prediction is the popularity<br />and marketing of the show. When Severence season<br />two was about to release, I remember seeing it<br />everywhere online. I had not watched season 1<br />but after seeing all of the advertisement, I was<br />interested in catching up to see the new season.<br />I feel like that is an important factor because<br />it brings more attention to the show and with<br />that, garners a larger audience who will be more<br />invested. Severence is also leading with the most<br />nominations, 27 to be exact. I also understand the<br />Pitt is a big contender for the Outstanding Drama<br />Series category. Because of this, I do not rate<br />the probability too high. Looking at Polymarket,<br />I found that most people see Severance winning at<br />68% versus the Pitt at 32%. I found it important<br />to see what memebers in the Academy have to say<br />as they will be the ones voting. Critics on Vanity<br />Fair have shown sentiment that Severence will be<br />the frontrunner for this category. Critical Press<br />on the LA Times see it as a close call, leaning<br />toward the Pitt. There seems to be a bit of mixed<br />opinions, generally seeing this as a close call<br />between Severence and the Pitt. From other data<br />I found, there is roughly a 52-55% chance that a<br />most-nominated drama would win the award for drama<br />series. Based on the challenge of the Pitt as well<br />as the mixed seniment, I will put my prediction at<br />a 65% chance that Severence will win the Emmy for<br />Outstanding Drama Series."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,0)","legendgroup":"(Student,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.080000000000000002,0.17000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.080000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.080000000000000002,0.25,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.25,0.10000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.13,0.17999999999999999,0.17000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.13,0.10000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.14999999999999999,0.10000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.14999999999999999,0.16,0.10000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.22,0.25,0.13,0.14999999999999999],"y":[1.0196968539850786,1.0190895723644644,0.97569741150364275,0.95599445120897142,1.005766749335453,0.9569870779523626,1.0128660988993943,0.95909965750761328,1.0313944590045139,0.96596714300103481,1.0312849414302037,1.0275607601273804,1.0438962098676712,0.99230910604819655,0.98591181682422757,1.0107883947202936,0.95230168460402642,1.0497879986185581,1.0226772096240893,0.95282000824809077,1.0390915787545965,1.0184146462008357,1.0358177973423153,1.0145048927282914,0.9550520374905318,0.99084473724942657,0.99109556823968892,0.99784194019157435,1.0487674686592072,0.99249768899753688,0.98860135078430178,1.0260228807805105,0.95565697415731843,0.96796352642122652],"text":["Akshara Singh (8%): A ceasefire occurring between<br />the two states seems highly unlikely. Not only<br />has the war been going on for a long time now, but<br />neither side has shown signs of 'backing down'.<br />Putin continues to wage a war on Ukraine, despite<br />the tariffs on oil and other products being placed<br />on the country. Furthermore, I think neither state<br />sees a gain/benefit in a ceasefire and pushing<br />for peace, and consider the continuous fighting<br />to be more beneficial or impactful for their<br />individual countries. After switching from placing<br />embargos to now embracing Putin's plan, Trump's<br />added support only fuels the fire that keeps<br />the war going. Other than the past and recent<br />current events that've occurred surrounding the<br />Russia-Ukraine conflict, predicting a potential<br />solution to happen by November for something that<br />has been going on for years just seems highly<br />improbable.","Alizah Mudaliar (17%): It is unlikely that Russia<br />and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire. There have<br />been previous talks for a ceasefire that have not<br />been successful. Given that Ukraine demands Russia<br />fully withdraw their troops and Russia wants<br />more territory, neither country will come to an<br />agreement in the next 3 months for a long-lasting<br />ceasefire. If there is a ceasefire, it will likely<br />be broken soon after due to conflicting interests.","Amanda Neighbour (15%): Ceasefires take both sides<br />to work, and unfortunately neither sides have<br />shown any signs of compromise. Battlefields are<br />not slowing down, which indicate no ceasefire in<br />the near future. With only a few months left of<br />the year, it appears to be unlikely a ceasefire<br />will occur. The most pressure was applied after<br />Trump's election, claiming he would end the war<br />in 100 days, however, this movement did not occur.<br />Russia's reasons for invading Ukraine are still<br />the same--wanting to return land back to the<br />homeland--and Ukraine is not willing. Th leaders<br />have not met since 2019, and the President of<br />Turkey claimed they are not near a sit down point.<br />Just four days ago, Russia attacked Ukraine’s<br />Zaporizhia and Kyiv hits Russian oil refineries.","Ana Valencia (8%): It is highly improbable that<br />Russia and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire<br />before November 25, 2025. Russia insists on<br />maximalist demands, such as Ukraine ceding the<br />Donbas and abandoning NATO ambitions, while<br />Ukraine refuses any concessions that undermine<br />sovereignty or security. Forecasting models like<br />RAND place the probability of a 2025 ceasefire at<br />only 11%, especially considering on a ceasefire<br />that may only satisfy one side over the other,<br />which means the probability will also decrease<br />based on those scenarios.","Anna Barton-Caucci (20%): I think it is unlikely<br />that there will be a ceasefire between Russia and<br />Ukraine before the end of November because Ukraine<br />and Russia have completely different wants and<br />they have consistently been at odds for a while.<br />They are both resistant to even having a civil<br />conversation at the moment which makes it unlikely<br />that they could formally agree upon a ceasefire<br />agreement. There are also not a lot of domestic<br />incentives or pushes to end the war right now on<br />both sides.","Anna Kneser (15%): Ultimately, Russia's demands<br />remain \"unchanged\" and there is no foreseeable<br />change in their stance. There are still active<br />operations and pressure on multiple fronts, so<br />I highly doubt that the violence will slow down<br />before November 25th because there has been too<br />much bad blood between the two countries for too<br />long of a time. Additionally, Trump's position has<br />changed after a meeting with Putin, now advocating<br />for an end to the war instead of just a ceasefire.<br />Ending the war will ultimately take longer if<br />this is the main focus now. If anything, I can<br />potentially see a temporary ceasefire during the<br />holidays in December, but that is outside of the<br />scope that we are predicting.","Arshia Charkhian (8%): Russia and Ukraine are<br />unlikely to agree on a ceasefire agreement if<br />it seems like a short-term solution, and both<br />countries' interests are still completely at odds.<br />The odds are higher with Trump in office, as he<br />ran his campaign on creating peace swiftly and<br />would be more inclined to give Ukraine a losing<br />hand to achieve that. But given the November 25<br />date, it is unlikely for agreements to happen this<br />quickly.","Blake Martin (25%): I said there was a 25% chance<br />that there will be an agreed upon ceasefire<br />because both sides remain deeply divided on core<br />demands, with little trust and no framework that's<br />credible for a resolution. Past ceasefires have<br />fallen apart and neither side feels much pressure<br />to stop fighting right now. Talks have happened,<br />but nothing serious or concrete has happened<br />from them yet. So while it is not impossible,<br />especially because of recent talks world leaders<br />have had, a deal in the next few months is highly<br />unlikely.","Breanne Talley (15%): The core reason I don’t<br />think we’ll get that by late November is that<br />the politics, battlefield behavior, and mediation<br />signals all point away from a deal on this short<br />timeline. Publicly, the Kremlin still couples any<br />halt in fighting to outcomes Kyiv can’t accept,<br />withdrawal from regions Russia claims, and limits<br />on Ukraine’s future security alignment. Reuters’<br />mid-August coverage flatly said Moscow’s demands<br />were “unchanged,” and subsequent reporting<br />described a package that includes renouncing NATO<br />and keeping Western troops out, conditions that<br />Kyiv has repeatedly rejected. That’s not a “split<br />the difference in a few weeks” gap; it’s two<br />incompatible stories about how the war should end.","Caleb Lux (15%): There is no real incentive for<br />either Russia or Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire<br />in the next three months. Ukraine is not pressed<br />for resources, even as US support wanes, due to<br />the commitment of other G7 nations. Russia has<br />not achieved its goals, falling short on its<br />territorial expansion. Without any indication<br />of further peacemaking, it is only reasonable<br />to assume the status quo: the raging war for the<br />past 3.5 years will continue on. It is possible<br />a temporary ceasefire could occur, but I find it<br />unlikely.","Caroline Mattox (25%): There is a lot of pressure<br />from outside parties to end the war but I'm not<br />sure that either of these countries are truly<br />working towards a ceasefire. Negotiations between<br />these countries are not even close to complete<br />or at a point where a ceasefire could even be<br />possible. These two countries have just shown no<br />desire to truly work together to make a ceasefire<br />happen so I do not see a ceasefire happening<br />before November 25th.","Chris Haswell (10%): Neither Ukraine nor Russia<br />appears to want a ceasefire, as both sides see<br />the other's demands as unacceptable. Ukraine<br />is not yet broken, and they appear to be able<br />to withstand another three months of war.<br />Russia seems content to continue making meager<br />territorial gains, and they have no reason to<br />demand anything less than Donbas, which Ukraine<br />is simply unwilling to give up. I don't think that<br />President Trump has the power to force both sides<br />to the table, and his recent summits with both<br />Putin and Europe indicate a continuation of the<br />status quo.","Cierra Green (15%): It is unlikely that Russia<br />and Ukraine will reach an agreement by November<br />25th. Although Ukraine is willing to make an<br />agreement, there is little incentive for Russia<br />to ceasefire. Ukraine and Russia must also agree<br />on the terms of the ceasefire itself. This takes<br />communication, time, and negotiation to come to a<br />conclusion: a goal which is difficult to achieve<br />in such little time. Additionally, looking at<br />Polymarket (as of 9/2), the prediction is 19% that<br />Ukraine and Russia will ceasefire by the end of<br />2025. Meaning a ceasefire is unlikely. Since this<br />question puts the deadline about a month earlier,<br />the likelihood for November 25th will be lower.<br />Using another political forecasting website, RAND<br />(as of 9/2), 90% of voters believe there will<br />not be a ceasefire agreement before 2026. Using<br />this reasoning and a middle ground between both<br />forecasting websites, I believe there is a 15%<br />chance there will be a ceasefire agreement.","Elizabeth Nelson (15%): I believe because of the<br />short time-line and because it seems that the war<br />is not cooling down any time soon, I believe it is<br />pretty unlikely that Russia and Ukraine will agree<br />to a ceasefire before November 25th. I think it<br />is especially insightful to note that the mediator<br />is not ready to make a comment yet. I don't think<br />that the chances are quite zero just because there<br />are obviously certain circumstances that could<br />make a ceasefire the only option, but I don't<br />think the odds are in a ceasefires' favor.","Ellie Null (15%): I am very skeptical that there<br />will be a ceasefire before November 25th 2025. For<br />one, after reading these briefs and doing my own<br />outside research I find that there is less than<br />a 20% chance of a ceasefire. Considering the fact<br />they are not slowing down or showing any signs of<br />compromise. They both want different things and<br />have been consistent on their views and on the<br />battlefield. Furthermore, there might be a little<br />input from Donald Trump meaning that he could<br />put pressure on both sides but I don't know how<br />helpful that truly will be. I think overall that<br />there is not a high chance at all to a ceasefire<br />because there are so many moving parts and demands<br />from each side. These two leaders have not met in<br />person in a while so i dont think they are ready<br />to broker a deal.","Hunter Murray (13%): The only reason I have this<br />over 10% is because I believe the \"Trump\" factor<br />could increase the likelihood of a ceasefire<br />(possibly over 15%). But his current workload<br />(distractions from foreign policy) and questions<br />about his health lower my prediction to a slim<br />13%.","Jack Lutz (18%): The fighting within Ukraine still<br />continues, with Russian missiles still striking<br />Ukrainian civilians, and Ukranian drones still<br />blowing the tops off of Russian tanks. Neither<br />side is currently willing to even sit down to<br />talk, let alone talk about any form of ceasefire.<br />However, President Trump is still trying to find<br />a solution to get both sides to back off and<br />accept peace, so it remains possible. However, the<br />disadvantage a ceasefire would currently give both<br />sides, along with neither side being happy with<br />potential peace resolutions makes this an unlikely<br />occurrence.","Jackson Bost (17%): The only point in the war<br />where a ceasefire was attempted was Easter, a<br />move that was widely viewed as a stunt meant to<br />shift blame onto Ukraine. That move, though, came<br />near the beginning of Trump's second term, making<br />it an opportune moment for Putin to test Trump's<br />response. At this point in the war, however,<br />there is no reason for Putin to test or entertain<br />a ceasefire. The war is supported by 75% of<br />the population, US sanctions and aid constantly<br />flipflop, and while not ideal, the humanitarian<br />situation hasn't drawn attention like Gaza, making<br />a ceasefire unlikely.","Jhaycee Barnes (20%): Russia has ruled out a<br />stand-alone ceasefire, and Ukraine has rejected<br />proposals like buffer zones, showing both sides<br />remain firm in their positions. The continued<br />strikes show neither side sees value in stopping<br />the war, and both know the other would use any<br />pause to regroup their military.","Kira Fleischer (13%): Neither country has shown<br />any promising mediation signals, especially<br />considering the lack of communication and<br />willingness to communicate from both presidents.<br />There is also no meaningful pressure in Ukraine<br />or Russia from their citizens for a ceasefire,<br />considering the fact that it would allow the<br />other side to regroup and strengthen. The war<br />has been going on for so long, and I do not see<br />any convincing hints of it ending in the next 3<br />months.","Kristoffer Fields (10%): I find it highly unlikely<br />that they will come to a ceasefire given the<br />current sociopolitical climate of that region.<br />This has also been ongoing conflict and despite<br />peace talks nothing has come to play. Furthermore,<br />they are several other humanitarian crisis going<br />on around the world and the United Nations has not<br />done much about. The only possible reason a cease<br />fire make come would be due to external interest<br />in the region from a foreign authority, in<br />essence, Ukraine does not stand a chance to Russia<br />unfortuanetly.","Liz Yancey (15%): Based on what was said in class<br />today and in the briefings, the consensus was<br />that there would not be a ceasefire between these<br />two states. I agree with this assertion primarily<br />because neither state has any interest in ending<br />the war. There is too much to lose/gain for either<br />side if fighting stopped, even for a limited<br />time. During the ceasefire period, both sides<br />would most likely build up their arms and resume<br />fighting, making the conflict even worse than<br />before. Ukraine also has immense support from the<br />international community, which further fuels its<br />fighting and incentivizes it to continue.","Mateo Ceron (15%): As of right now, I believe that<br />a ceasefire is unlikely. Neither party is wanting<br />a ceasefire (which is kind of the main part of<br />a successful ceasefire) and neither Ukraine nor<br />Russia is wanting to cede without adding their<br />own special requests to an agreement. Putin wants<br />to limit Ukraine's military and obviously Ukraine<br />is not going to agree to terms that leave them<br />worse off than they were when the war started.<br />We also have the Trump administration to think<br />about however, because they do have the ability<br />to attempt to strong arm the states into an<br />agreement. However, we've seen his meeting with<br />Putin at the Alaska summit, which sort of pushed<br />the ball towards no ceasefire or treaty (due to<br />the terms Putin presented).","Nic Curtis (15%): I find the likelihood of Russia<br />and Ukraine agreeing to a ceasefire before the<br />end of the semester very unlikely for multiple<br />reasons. For one, Putin and Zelenskyy's terms for<br />a ceasefire are completely different. Putin wants<br />more land than they have control of right now in<br />Ukraine while Zelenskyy is unwilling to succeed<br />any territory. Outside actors have also expressed<br />that the two leaders are still unwilling to sit<br />down with each other a talk. Zelenskyy has no<br />incentive to trust Putin as well. President Trump<br />has also favored a peace deal over a ceasefire,<br />expressing his belief that ceasefires do not<br />work. Other forecasters and markets predict the<br />likelihood of a ceasefire before the end of the<br />year as being slim. There is some precedent of<br />fighting stopping, like the 30 hour fighting hold,<br />but this is not enough to convince me.","Owen Johnston (10%): Based upon the lack of<br />geopolitical indictors that historically indicate<br />a ceasefire will be reached, combined with<br />polymarket's all-time low probability of 20%, and<br />the RAND forecast being at 11% for a ceasefire<br />being reached before the end of the year, I give<br />a 10% chance accounting for the earlier date of<br />November 25th.","Paul Frilingos (20%): This isn't the most precise<br />prediction. This war has been going on for some<br />time now, and the only major change recently<br />has been Donald Trump becoming president of the<br />united states again. Trump's most recent position<br />on the war has been against a ceasefire in favor<br />of a peace deal, however a peace deal seem very<br />unlikely given what both sides want. However, the<br />war of attrition could always let up, which is why<br />I can't bring myself to go lower than 20%.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (15%): With talks<br />stalled, Russia’s hardline demands, Trump leaning<br />toward Moscow, and Ukraine insisting on security<br />guarantees, a ceasefire before November 25 looks<br />unlikely. War fatigue is growing, but heavy<br />fighting and deep mistrust make progress slim. In<br />light of these dynamics, my forecast is that there<br />is only about a 15% probability of a ceasefire<br />being reached before November 25.","Reese Fabritius (16%): As I mentioned in my<br />briefing, I just think that these two countries<br />want such different outcomes that there is just<br />not enough time before this deadline for their<br />objectives to change. However, with American<br />pressure, it may be slightly more possible that<br />they will be pushed from external factors.","Ruhi Doddamani (10%): Considering the opposing<br />motives of both Russia and Ukraine, what<br />historically signals a ceasefire, what Europe is<br />doing, as well as recent presidential actions,<br />steps have only taken us backwards in reaching<br />greater security for Ukraine. In international<br />affairs, ceasefires are frequently observed to<br />follow conditions seeming like a mutual military<br />stalemate, followed by significant humanitarian<br />crises and intense diplomatic pressure.<br />Additionally, it is common for negotiating parties<br />to escalate military actions immediately before or<br />during talks, strategically vying for a stronger<br />position, a dynamic often termed \"fighting to the<br />finish.\" While civilian casualties still run high<br />in Ukraine, interviews before and after any of<br />President Zelensky’s summits with citizens in Kyiv<br />show them supportive and patriotic, rallied behind<br />much of what their administration is doing. Russia<br />remains relatively unperturbed by American tariffs<br />on oil and other products.","Ryan Marx (10%): I believe there to be only a<br />10% chance of Russia and Ukraine agreeing to<br />a ceasefire by November 25th. My first bit of<br />reasoning is that with over 300,000 soldiers<br />killed in Ukraine, Putin is very unlikely<br />to commit to any sort ceasefire in Ukraine<br />without any sort of territorial or political<br />concessions, despite the fact that Ukrainian<br />president Volodymyr Zelensky has made a point of<br />stating that Ukraine will concede no territory<br />or political power as conditions for a ceasefire.<br />Furthermore, Russia has continued to Launch<br />offensives into new Regions and has continued<br />its ongoing aerial assaults, not only does the<br />logistics behind such an operation make it so<br />that the first days of said offensives will run<br />dangerously close to the november deadline, but<br />with these operations comes a bolstered opinion<br />of Moscow's perception of military advantage and<br />only serves to further reduce any motivation for<br />compromise. Therefore it is safe to assume there<br />is only a 10 percent chance of a ceasefire by<br />november 25th.","Sade Ezekiel (22%): I believe that Russia and<br />Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire before November<br />25. This is because Trump has started the<br />negotiations between both parties and has met<br />with both individually. A ceasefire will also<br />be beneficial to Russia because of the sanctions<br />that the US and allies have imposed on them.<br />I think that the ceasefire might not last due<br />to both parties disagreeing on land lines and<br />negotiations.","Sarah Kate Maher (25%): The leaders of Russia and<br />Ukraine won't even meet to discuss any diplomatic<br />matters right now, so I doubt that they would<br />get together to negotiate a ceasefire in the near<br />future. Even if they did in the next few weeks,<br />negotiations after that initial meeting may still<br />take longer. There is not a clear path to decide<br />on a ceasefire or to later enfore it","Sasha Mahtani (13%): The reason for the<br />probability being so low is because of the<br />parameters we discussed in class. Considering<br />that Velensky and Putin haven't met face to face<br />since 2019 and this conflict has been going on<br />for over 3 years, it leads me to believe there<br />is a very small chance that a ceasefire will be<br />agreed upon by November 25th. There could be a<br />chance, however, when we consider Donald Trump's<br />support for a ceasefire, and how he has threatened<br />Putin with massive sanctions and tariffs. Since<br />this has been going on for so long it is unlikely<br />a ceasefire will happen within the next three<br />months.","Zafar Ali (15%): This question seems to be a<br />reoccurring topic as this war has been going on<br />for the last three years. In the past there have<br />been pauses so it is not completely impossible<br />to see something happening in the near future.<br />However, I feel that there are many more factors<br />leaning toward a lower probability of a ceasefire<br />agreement. For instance, this war has been<br />going on for several years and it does not seem<br />advantageous for either side to come to a halt<br />now. From what I have gathered, both Russia and<br />Ukraine find it better to prolong the war as a<br />means of forcing the opposition into a weaker<br />position. Along with this, a ceasefire usually is<br />not strategic since it allows for both sides to<br />restock on resources, ammunition, weaponry, and<br />generally speaking prepare to go back to fighting.<br />A ceasefire does not seem very likely for the<br />reason that Russia and Ukraine have opposing<br />demands, most notably, they can't seem to agree<br />on territorial disputes. Russia essentially wants<br />Ukraine to concede certain territories to Russia<br />which Ukraine will not agree on as the main<br />reason this war has gone on so long is because<br />Ukraine is very staunch on fighting to protect<br />their sovereignty. When we also take into account<br />the parameters of the timeframe between now<br />and November 25th, this lowers the chances even<br />further because why would we see any form of a<br />ceasefire take place so soon after these past 3<br />years of the war? My prediction is that there is a<br />15% chance because I first considered the possible<br />reasons of seeing an agreement and weighed them<br />against the likelihood of not getting any deal. As<br />low as I believe the odds are, there aren't strict<br />parameters on whether or not a pause remains<br />throughout the original peace agreement."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.69999999999999996],"y":[1.959267493081279],"text":"Crowd (70%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,0)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.14999999999999999],"y":[0.95792340878397231],"text":"Crowd (15%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.84999999999999998],"y":[1.9805235322797672],"text":"Joe Ornstein (85%): Historically, a strong<br />predictor of success in this category is the<br />number of other Emmy nominations a show has<br />received.

Taxpayers suffer and<br />the economy is negatively impacted, despite the<br />political leverage a party may gain from such<br />an event. Oftentimes, just the prospect of a<br />shutdown is enough of a sway to get political<br />players moving and coming towards a consensus. But<br />after the discussion in class it is also slightly<br />likely that a shutdown could happen because it<br />is possible there won't be as much backlash.<br />So overall, it's a very close call on whether a<br />shutdown could happen or not, and my probability<br />reflects that.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (65%): Since Congress needs<br />to approve the next budget by September 30th and<br />it doesn't look like they're close to reaching<br />an agreement, I estimate that there is a 65%<br />likelihood of a government shutdown in 2025. The<br />deadline is quickly approaching, but rather than<br />cooperating, both parties appear more interested<br />in squabbling about spending priorities and using<br />the circumstance for their own political ends. I<br />believe that a shutdown is more likely than not<br />given the level of division in Congress, even<br />though other analysts suggest the probabilities<br />are closer to 50/50. Federal agencies would be<br />forced to begin laying off employees, critical<br />services would stop or slow down, and the economy<br />might suffer from the uncertainty if legislators<br />are unable to agree a budget or at least a<br />temporary extension. A 65% chance, in my opinion,<br />indicates that a last-minute compromise is still<br />possible, but given the lack of collaboration<br />and the history of threatening to shut down the<br />government, I believe that a shutdown is the more<br />likely course of action.","Alizah Mudaliar (45%): 19 continuing resolutions<br />have been enacted in the past 6 fiscal years to<br />avoid government shutdowns. The last government<br />shutdown was from December 22, 2018 to January<br />25, 2019 due to disagreements over funding for a<br />border wall. It is more likely that there will be<br />another CR passed to avoid a government shutdown.<br />However, there have been 21 government shutdowns,<br />with three being during Trump’s presidency. But,<br />it is unlikely that all groups in Congress will<br />agree on the appropriations bill and the lack of<br />bipartisan support to avoid a shutdown makes the<br />likelihood of a shutdown more credible.","Amanda Neighbour (35%): Every year, the<br />lesgislature cannot agreed on a budget, but<br />time and time again, a last minute consinuing<br />resolution comes about. Hyperpartisanship<br />continues to cause issues in agreeing on a budget,<br />yet 12 appropriations must make it though House<br />and Senate committees to avoid being shut down.<br />There has been at least one continuing resoltuion<br />46 out of the last 49 fiscal years. With a<br />republican majority in every branch, I believe<br />this lessens the chance for a shutdown. Although<br />democrats seem like they are not budging, it is<br />important to note that almost every year this<br />same event occurs, and last minute continuing<br />resolutions end up extending the timeline.","Ana Valencia (56%): I estimate that a shut down<br />will happen at 56% because of the time frame,<br />partisan politics, ahd historical track record<br />for shutdowns in the current administration. With<br />the Republicans controlling both the Senate and<br />House, it would seem feasible to avoid a shutdown<br />but if it does happen then the signing of a CR<br />will happen after funding expires. Even then,<br />partisan politics mean an obstacle for Republicans<br />in the Senate, where they need the support of 7<br />democrats to pass a funding bill in that chamber,<br />which seems unlikely. The longest shutdown was<br />also during a Trump Administration with 35 days to<br />reach conclusion.","Anna Barton-Caucci (53%): I believe there is a<br />50% chance that the government will shut down this<br />semester. Because there is only a 4 week deadline<br />for the Congress to agree on a plan, and there<br />does not seem to be an obvious, productive plan<br />for both parties right now I think it is very<br />possible the government could shut down. There<br />are several reasons lawmakers could work hard to<br />prevent a shutdown or find a temporary solution,<br />but I think it is still very possible. I am not<br />confident either way, but I think a shutdown is<br />very possible, despite it not being ideal.","Anna Kneser (55%): With the end of the fiscal<br />year on September 30th, there is a possibility<br />that the government will shut down due to the<br />lack of money. Even though a shut down is not<br />ideal, the past 3 shutdowns have been under the<br />Trump Administration. Because Trump is president<br />currently, this sways my prediction to higher<br />than 50% because he has shown he is not afraid<br />to enable a shut down. There is not much time to<br />reach a compromise, and democrats and republics<br />are having a difficult time making a deal. I find<br />it hard to believe that any party will budge.<br />However, I'm cautious to make my prediction<br />higher than 55% because this shutdown would have<br />a very negative effect on the Republican Party and<br />Trump's reputation, especially when there is so<br />much political turmoil tied to his name right now.<br />Nobody wins in a shutdown, and it is practically<br />irrational for both parties.","Arshia Charkhian (55%): I am uncertain about<br />a government shutdown due to its unpredictable<br />nature, but I lean towards it happening due to how<br />divided both parties are. The Trump administration<br />is not adverse to shutdowns, with it happening<br />twice before, so it is unlikely that he will<br />intervene to make a deal.","Blake Martin (42%): i gave this probability a 45%<br />because since we are under a unified government<br />it will be hard for there to be a government<br />\"shut down\" without major pushback. On top of<br />this nobody wants a government shutdown. Voters<br />are not in favor of it and lawmakers as well.<br />The democratic party is just going to comply<br />because that seems as if it is already happening.<br />I am not extremely confident however because<br />democratic leaders now are more likely to push for<br />confrontation on the possible budget proposals and<br />might contest the budget more leading to a \"shut<br />down.\" However, recent news outlets are saying<br />now that Trump is proposing a possible continuing<br />resolution which would prevent the government from<br />have a \"shut down.\"","Breanne Talley (45%): I would say there is a<br />roughly 45% chance the U.S. federal government<br />will shut down before November 25, 2025. Congress<br />hasn’t passed any of the FY 2026 appropriations<br />bills, and the October 1 deadline makes an early<br />shutdown possible. However, prediction markets<br />(Polymarket ~43–49%) and historical patterns<br />suggest lawmakers usually pass a short-term<br />continuing resolution at the last minute to avoid<br />blame. The fight over ACA subsidies adds risk, but<br />political incentives point toward a stopgap deal<br />that keeps the government open.","Caleb Lux (60%): It is more likely than not that<br />the government will shutdown at the end of this<br />month. Democrats are not in a position to strike<br />a deal, and Republicans need to tow a careful line<br />to keep a compromise that the Freedom Caucus would<br />agree to. There were two shutdowns in Trump 1, and<br />he isn't positioning himself as the dealmaker this<br />time around. The politics of the moment may be too<br />difficult to avoid a shutdown.","Caroline Mattox (58%): I believe there is a 58%<br />chance that we see a government shutdown at some<br />point before the end of the semester. I believe<br />there is such a high chance of this happening<br />because the two parties have such a hard time<br />coming to an agreement on anything. I think there<br />is small chance that they reach an agreement<br />but I’m not sure that it will happen before the<br />deadline.","Chris Haswell (65%): I think it is more likely<br />than not that Democrats will vote to shut down the<br />government. Democrat voters and thought leaders<br />are more ideologically opposed to the Trump<br />administration than ever, and many influential<br />democratic pundits like Ezra Klein went as far<br />as to call for a change in democratic leadership<br />if they move to keep the government open.<br />Personally, I don't see how the Democrats could<br />strategically vote for a CR when a shutdown would<br />hurt Republicans worse. They are being pressured<br />to put up more of a fight, and I think it is<br />likely that they will take this opportunity to<br />win over disillusioned moderates and democrats<br />who are tired of their complicity with unpopular<br />Republican policies.","Cierra Green (55%): As of right now, Democrats nor<br />Republicans seem to want to make a compromise or<br />cave into the other party's demands. Specifically<br />for the Democrats, Chuck Schumer faced backlash<br />for backing the CR in March 2025. His party and<br />supporters are upset his his March decision and<br />are pushing him to unite the Senate Democrats.<br />As mentioned in class, Democrat supporters would<br />also be upset with their representatives if they<br />folded to the Republican's wishes. This would<br />lead to a shutdown. As seen in the past, the<br />Trump administration is not afraid of a government<br />shutdown to get what they want either. However,<br />it is possible that Congress members will make<br />a last minute agreement that both Democrats<br />and Republicans are willing to pass. While<br />researching this question, there were no official<br />statements about Congressmen voting in accordance<br />with the opposing party. This is because it is<br />very unlikely someone would make that a public<br />statement. If any Congress members were to switch<br />sides on voting, we would not know at this time.<br />Therefore, I am not very confident that a shutdown<br />will happen, but I believe it is more likely to<br />happen than to not happen.","Elizabeth Nelson (35%): The fiscal year begins<br />October 1st, and a lot of briefings and even<br />Polymarket suggests that it is very close to a<br />50/50 shot. President Trump has indicated that he<br />will make the budget catered toward republicans,<br />so democrats are at the point where they are fed<br />up since they are supposed to be creating this<br />\"bipartisan\" budget, but it could be vetoed at any<br />point. I think that the CR will be passed through,<br />and a government shut-down will be avoided. I<br />think it is a lot more rare to have a shutdown<br />when one party has control over three branches,<br />and the last shutdown was as a result of democrats<br />not wanting \"The Wall\" to be government funded. I<br />think that there is a chance the government could<br />shut down, but I think more likely a different<br />agreement willo be reached.","Francesca Mariano (54%): Government shutdowns are<br />extremely unpopular amongst voters and politicians<br />alike. They hurt the economy anf they leave<br />millions out of work for however long the shutdown<br />is. Oftentimes, Congress passes a continuing<br />resolutions (CRs) to stave off government shutdown<br />and extend time to amend and debate the budget.<br />The last three government shutdowns were under<br />the Trump Administration, including the longest<br />in history of 35 days. With increased polarization<br />and previous deals made by minority leader<br />Schumer, many of the briefs thought it unlikely<br />for many, if any, compromises or deals to be<br />made before the next possible shutdown period<br />without another CR. Trump has also been reportedly<br />making it harder for Congress to come to an<br />agreement, causing his party to also be unwilling<br />to comprise. Given the seemingly legislative<br />stalemate on the budget and the unpopularity<br />of government shutdown, I place my probability<br />similar to those my of classmates at 54%.","Ellie Null (55%): I predicted that there is a 55<br />percent chance of a government shutdown. Every<br />year it's an argument about how much to spend and<br />what areas should be prioritized over others. Over<br />a dozen governments shut down over this budget<br />issue every year. Don't last long but do happen.<br />The budget needs three points of agreement to<br />get this budget passed and due to this political<br />climate i dont sense that there will be an easy<br />agreement about this budget in the future. However<br />no one really benefits from a shutdown, so there<br />is a 50/50 chance of an agreement for the benefit<br />of everyone. 3 democrats who voted for cloture<br />would need to switch their vote out of the nine.<br />I also think public and media outcry will effect<br />this decision as well. It is going to be hard to<br />tell, so I stand at 55 percent.","Jack Lutz (45%): While many of those serving in<br />the house and the senate on both sides of the<br />aisle would like to avoid a shutdown, leadership<br />on both sides and the Trump administration keeps<br />making the passing of a continuing resolution less<br />and less likely. Due to recent pressure, Chuck<br />Schumer is less likely to fold and compromise<br />with the Republicans, and will likely be seen<br />as the example of which way to vote/act for many<br />of his own party. Other key democrat leaders<br />are hardlining that they are willing to accept a<br />shutdown rather than the terms proposed to them.<br />Finally, Trump has continued to demand additions<br />to the budget that do not appeal across the aisle<br />and has caused discourse within his own party.","Jackson Bost (52%): Democrats in Congress are<br />growing increasingly restless with the Trump<br />administration's attacks on their power of the<br />purse, with that likely to worsen in the wake of<br />Chief Justice Roberts's decision to permit the<br />freeze of foreign aid funding while a legally<br />untested pocket recission works its way through<br />Congress. While certain senators like Shaheen<br />and King (voted for the CR in March), Schumer and<br />Durbin (senate minority leaders), and Cortez Masto<br />(swing state voter against filibusters) could be<br />expected to vote for cloture, Senators Gillibrand,<br />Hassan, and Peters could very well vote against it<br />with mounting pressure from the party. Given that<br />Senator Ossoff, someone up for reelection in the<br />next cycle in the most contested seat in the US,<br />staved off constituents' calls on the last vote,<br />senators who aren't up again until 2030, 2028,<br />and are retiring lack the same sort of pressure to<br />give in to a CR.","James Hunter Darke (55%): I believe there will be<br />a government shutdown by the end of the semester.<br />Congress is increasingly polzarized, and with<br />the political nature of government spending in<br />the last couple months, I think there will be<br />shutdown. There we already 2 during Trumps first<br />term, and the divide between parties has only<br />grown since then.","Jhaycee Barnes (46%): In the past few decades,<br />shutdowns have been rare. In most years, one<br />side of Congress fights until the very end and<br />eventually \"folds\" with a last minute CR. However,<br />the current political context raises the odds of a<br />shutdown. Congress is super divided, and President<br />Trump has an interesting style of negotiating<br />and has shown before (during the longest shutdown<br />in history) that he is not afraid to allow a<br />shutdown to occur. At the same time, with midterms<br />approaching, both parties have strong reasons to<br />avoid the public backlash that would come from an<br />extended shutdown.","Kira Fleischer (51%): It seems that a the<br />likelihood of a government shutdown could really<br />go either way. Partisanship within the legislative<br />and executive branches has been making budgeting<br />extremely difficult, which could spiral into<br />a shutdown. Also, strong democrat voices are<br />less willing to negotiate, and may influence a<br />shutdown.","Kristoffer Fields (35%): I would place the<br />probability of a shutdown occurring to be about 35<br />percent because while I do think it is plausible<br />and could happen for various reasons like money<br />mismanagement I still think that it is more<br />likely to not shutdown, because despite political<br />partisanship within the government I do not think<br />it is enough to swing into a nationwide shut down.","Liz Yancey (45%): I think that if this CR is<br />anything like the one in March, Republicans<br />will fight to pass it. If they already have the<br />majority in all three branches, any opposition<br />the Democrats can muster up will be seemingly<br />inconsequential. Public opposition was widespread<br />and intense in March, yet that did not deter<br />Republicans from opposing the CR. It will come<br />down to whether the CR is 'clean.' If it's not, it<br />will lose Democratic support and possibly even the<br />support of Republican moderates as well. There is<br />still a decent chance it will shut down, but based<br />on last time, I doubt it will.","Manuv Datta (25%): No, the federal government<br />will not be shut down at any point during the<br />remainder of the semester. I make this estimate<br />based mainly on the fact that while under<br />President Trump, the federal government has shut<br />down on 5 separate occasions. This amount is<br />more than double than that of the next President,<br />which is 2, under President Bill Clinton.<br />Although the federal government is currently very<br />contentious and partisan, a 6th shutdown would be<br />unprecedented, and is further away on the spectrum<br />of probability. Therefore, I am taking the bet<br />that Congress manages to pass a budget bill<br />successfully.","Nic Curtis (65%): There are many obstacles<br />that are in the way of preventing a government<br />shutdown. Democrat leadership faced immense<br />backlash from their constituents this past<br />March when they caved into Republican demands,<br />but prevented a shutdown. Democrats have little<br />incentive to keep the government running as it<br />would express their continued displeasure with the<br />current administrations use of the government's<br />resources. Republicans, on the other hand, have<br />a majority in both chambers of congress to, in<br />theory, pass what ever budget plan they want.<br />Despite their majority, some in their own party,<br />such as the Freedom Caucus in the House and Rand<br />Paul in the Senate, may oppose a plan if it does<br />not align with their goals of cutting spending.<br />On top of all of this, Trump would need to approve<br />the budget plan which, if not up to his liking,<br />he can deny. There is precedent for this as two<br />government shutdowns, including the longest one<br />in US history, occurred during his first term.<br />The only reason I think a shutdown may not happen<br />is due to the possible passage of a CR, which has<br />happened multiple times now and at the very last<br />minute, but it is hard to say as we do not know<br />the details of the CR. Even if a CR is approved<br />before the end of the month, the issue may crop up<br />again before the end of the semester depending on<br />the details.","Owen Johnston (40%): Given that little progress<br />has been made in Congress on a CR or budget,<br />I give it 40%. I believe it is more likely,<br />however, that the government narrowly avoids a<br />shutdown because Republicans hold majorities in<br />the House and Senate, and hold the Presidency. The<br />Republicans will desire to avoid a shutdown to not<br />appear as being unable to govern.","Paul Frilingos (59%): We got very close to a<br />government shutdown earlier this year, with the<br />senate cloture vote being by a margin of 3. Since<br />it's unlikely for the House to agree on a new<br />budget, a continuing resolution is the far more<br />likely method of preventing a shutdown. However,<br />the Democrats who chose to vote for cloture on<br />the CR earlier this year faced a lot of pushback<br />from supporters, so they could be more willing to<br />prevent a CR from passing this time. On the other<br />hand, the concern is high for Democrats that a<br />shutdown would be blamed on them and hurt their<br />reelection chances. Senate majority leader Chuck<br />Schumer now seems to be against any partisan CR,<br />but we'll see if that stays true come September<br />30. Ultimately, I think a shutdown is more likely<br />than not, but I'm not too confident.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (40%): I put<br />the chance of a shutdown at 40%. Things are<br />looking tense, but Congress usually finds a way<br />to avoid letting the government actually run out<br />of money. A shutdown would be costly, disruptive,<br />and politically damaging. I also think that<br />most lawmakers, especially those worried about<br />re-election, have many reasons to strike some<br />kind of deal. A shutdown is still possible, in my<br />opinion, but it is not the most likely scenario.","Reese Fabritius (65%): With the hostility and<br />polarization happening right now, I think it<br />is more likely than not that there will be a<br />government shutdown. I think with midterms coming<br />up, both sides will want to show strength as I<br />believe has already been proven by the recent<br />budget proposals.","Ruhi Doddamani (78%): I think my personal politics<br />are definitely seeping into my prediction, but<br />I'm relying on how the atmosphere has shifted<br />since six months ago in the aftermath of Schumer's<br />ill-received compromise. I've heard on ABC and<br />NBC that have had Democratic thought leaders<br />and actual respresentatives who voted last times<br />around that are displaying a change of heart,<br />because it's obvious the GOP is sheparding their<br />current agenda primarily through federal funding.<br />A shutdown would be the best way to confront<br />everything and check some reckless actions.","Ryan Marx (50%): I believe there is approximately<br />a 50% probability that the US Federal government<br />will be shut down by the End of the Fall<br />Semester. My first bit of reasoning is that<br />while historically many government shutdowns have<br />been avoided last minute, but with the trend of<br />Brinkmanship and an increase of partisan conflict<br />over the past few years this makes this specific<br />outcome seem less and less likely. Furthermore<br />Republican lawmakers in both the house and senate<br />hold the majority by a slim margin, with Democrats<br />declining to support a funding resolution due<br />to exclusion from negotiations meaning that<br />republicans are quite unlikely to come to the<br />table less they run the risk of losing the<br />majority.","Sade Ezekiel (35%): With the current threat of<br />a potential government shutdown, I believe that<br />there is a very low chance that the government<br />will shut down before the end of the semester.<br />Considering that we have not even completed<br />one year with Trump and the Republicans back in<br />office, it is in their best interest to reach an<br />agreement without major disruption and another<br />shutdown occurring under his lead. Moreover, if<br />the government did shutdown this would have a<br />very negative effect on Trump and the Republican<br />party’s reputation, after a very turbulent and<br />aggressive entry when resuming control. Although,<br />there are just a few short weeks before the end of<br />the fiscal year, where Congress must agree to the<br />presented spending or pass a short-term solution<br />approach. I would say 35% because there is also<br />pressure on the democratic party to not cave into<br />the Republicans negotiations.","Sarah Kate Maher (55%): In order for the<br />government not to shut down by the start of the<br />fiscal year on October 1st, Trump has to sign<br />all 12 appropriations or Congress has to pass a<br />continuing resolution. A continuing resolution was<br />enacted in March of 2025, which makes it likely<br />that another one might be enacted now. Therefore,<br />I'm kind of 50/50 on it will happen, but leaning<br />a little more towards yes because of the political<br />climate in Congress right now where neither side<br />wants to back down and \"lose\".","Sasha Mahtani (40%): It fairly likely that the<br />government will shut down before the end of the<br />semester. Considering the high party tensions,<br />and Trump's correlation between his presidency<br />and government shutdowns it is completely possible<br />that a shutdown is enacted. The reason why there<br />is doubt, is because no single party wants to take<br />any blame for a shutdown, as they prepare for the<br />2026 midterm election cycle. I gave a 40 percent<br />probability considering how neither parties want<br />this to be enacted.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (30%): Government shutdowns are<br />quite rare in American history, although I can't<br />put them behind Donald Trump given that the last<br />two were under his administration- and in the<br />same year. While that and the budget disagreement<br />persisting as we approach this deadline might<br />make a shutdown inevitable, headlines 10 hours ago<br />revealed the White House has requested Congress<br />to extend the deadline to January 31st- making a<br />shutdown unlikely. Given everything else going on,<br />Trump’s only concern might be not looking worse."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.59999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.63,0.37,0.59999999999999998,0.25,0.34999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.22,0.14999999999999999,0.23000000000000001,0.34999999999999998,0.25,0.40000000000000002,0.25,0.29999999999999999,0.52000000000000002,0.34999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.25,0.12,0.59999999999999998,0.23000000000000001,0.25,0.63,0.37,0.55000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.57999999999999996,0.40000000000000002,0.55000000000000004,0.25,0.28000000000000003,0.38,0.20000000000000001,0.56999999999999995,0.45000000000000001,0.25,0.29999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.28000000000000003,0.69999999999999996,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.25,0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.29999999999999999,0.25,0.56999999999999995,0.34000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.20000000000000001,0.10000000000000001,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.17999999999999999],"y":[1.0132254085503518,3.025231191236526,1.0204334982670844,3.0114717376418412,1.0201025862013922,2.971180982259102,0.97098505313042549,2.9966302175074815,3.0461514174472542,3.0066881978884341,3.0388371875509619,2.9838898482499645,1.0054375617997722,3.002858959371224,1.0096957975300029,2.9519374554045497,2.9918279829667882,0.99843916173558678,3.0350155392428859,0.99277046031784266,2.9617552102310585,3.0499689117772504,0.99740521640051161,2.9812894546426834,2.9583136560162528,1.0445000642212108,2.9712703534401954,0.97358868420124056,2.9605213211150838,0.97148754289373751,3.0437133427010847,1.0070866384077817,3.0291609553387389,2.9775281247682868,1.0164852767018602,2.9769052422838285,1.0188494465779514,3.0331043247366325,1.0182444392237813,3.0020389119395987,0.9705215986119583,3.040013848314993,0.99468284409958874,2.9660284363897516,1.0259079298703,3.0227605106076227,0.95227062490303072,3.0160563644254581,3.0125274406280367,2.9807776278117672,0.96859394053462888,2.9599408390931785,0.95623749808873981,3.0306532792048531,3.0352238977793604,0.99058525639120487,3.0466145783662797,0.98365926393307745,3.0413058544276281,1.0013355980627239,2.9828918912447988],"text":["Akshara Singh (60%): I think there's a decent<br />probability that the ruling will be reversed to<br />some extent at some point in time. I don't think<br />the Supreme Court will rule directly in opposition<br />of Trump and the tariffs he has set in place,<br />especially since the ideological disposition<br />of the court makes it so the majority does<br />lean right and in alliance with the president.<br />However, they could to some capacity address the<br />president's authority to impose such tariffs, as<br />many, including the Court of Appeals have argued<br />that he is exceeding his presidential capacities<br />by enacting such taxes. They could address the<br />wording of the International Emergency Economic<br />Powers Act in order to defend their argument and<br />refute the claim Trump made regarding his IEEPA<br />authority. But since the case has been expedited<br />and does hold some significance due to its impact<br />on not just the economy but also regarding just<br />how much power the president has when it comes to<br />imposing such restrictions, the case will surely<br />be reviewed and resolved at some point, just not<br />as soon as November 25th. Furthermore, despite<br />how important the case is, it is not nearly as<br />high stakes as a national crisis or constitutional<br />emergency, which is why it won't be addressed as<br />soon as possible.","Akshara Singh (20%): I think specifically because<br />of the amount of time left until November 25,<br />it is unlikely for the ruling on tariffs to be<br />appealed in time. As we discussed in class and<br />was mentioned in the briefings, despite the<br />case being expedited it doesn't hold as much<br />weightage/importance as other cases do. While it<br />is a high stakes case, it does not constitute as a<br />national security or constitutional emergency and<br />therefore could still take anywhere from 2-3 weeks<br />for a decision to be made. However, the Supreme<br />Court does have a history of overturning Court<br />of Appeals cases, and the majority of the current<br />court does fall within the same party and ideals<br />as the president, making me think they could vote<br />in favor of overturning a ruling that currently<br />goes against the tariffs Trump has imposed.<br />Despite everything that could happen, there is<br />still not enough time for the reversal to occur,<br />which is why my probability is so low.","Alizah Mudaliar (63%): There are three reasons<br />SCOTUS may reverse the Court of Appeal’s ruling.<br />First, SCOTUS decided to fast track the case could<br />lead to quicker ruling. Second, the IEEPA has<br />expanded the Trading with the Enemy Act, giving<br />Trump’s tariffs some merit. Third, conservatives<br />have the majority in the court, so they will<br />likely defer to the president. I believe it is<br />more probable to occur in several months.","Alizah Mudaliar (37%): There are three reasons<br />SCOTUS may reverse the Court of Appeal’s ruling.<br />First, SCOTUS decided to fast track the case could<br />lead to quicker ruling. Second, the IEEPA has<br />expanded the Trading with the Enemy Act, giving<br />Trump’s tariffs some merit. Third, conservatives<br />have the majority in the court, so they will<br />likely defer to the president. Despite this, it is<br />not very probable that the Court will overturn the<br />ruling in 2 ½ months. The amount of time remaining<br />for briefs and oral arguments leaves room for more<br />developments in the case and may lead to pushback<br />in the date they reverse the ruling.","Amanda Neighbour (60%): The court is comprised<br />of six conservative justices and three liberal<br />justices. Conservatives often favor broad readings<br />of statutory and presidential power pertaining<br />to foreign affairs and national security, similar<br />to those in Trump v. Hawaii (2018). The IEEPA has<br />very direct language about transactions during<br />emergencies. More originalist justices such as<br />Thomas and Alito will likely rule in Trump’s<br />favor. Textualists like Gorsuch and Barrett may<br />interpret tariffs as taxes on imports, which would<br />be under Congress’s authority in the Commerce<br />Clause, not clearly delegated in the IEEPA.<br />Justice Roberts is another potential swing vote,<br />as he is an institutionalist. Justices Sotomayor,<br />Kagan, and Jackson will likely affirm the Court of<br />Appeals as they are pro-limits on executive power<br />and skeptical of broad executive powers without<br />clear authorization. It truly could go either way,<br />but SCOTUS is more likely to reverse COA decisions<br />than not and the ideological leaning is stonger<br />for the conservatives. Emergency powers are<br />another thing that is upheld, historically.","Amanda Neighbour (25%): The Supreme Court is<br />typically very slow, ranging from weeks to<br />months to issue opinions. This case involves<br />significant constitutional questions and questions<br />of authority. Getting an oral argument to the<br />point of a full merits decision in less than<br />three weeks would be incredibly fast for the<br />Supreme Court. There is no indication that the<br />Court has committed to a timeline for a decision,<br />especially when they are hearing the case on the<br />first week of November. Historically, cases that<br />have been expedited range from quick decisions<br />(1-2 days) for national emergencies, to 2 months<br />for something deemed not urgent. This case shares<br />a lot of a parallels to Trump v. Hawaii (2018)<br />between the question of executive authority and<br />a consolidated case, yet the case was decided<br />two months after oral arguments. The variety<br />of ideological leanings and the more textualist<br />approach of some of the conservative judges can<br />make deliberation longer.","Ana Valencia (35%): The Trump administration<br />argues that broad tariff powers are essential<br />to respond to economic emergencies, while<br />the Federal Circuit held that IEEPA does not<br />authorize sweeping tariff regimes without explicit<br />congressional approval. Conservative justices<br />like Alito and Thomas may be inclined to favor<br />reversal in the Supreme Court as well. However,<br />the Supreme Court could also affirm Congress'<br />power to oversee the IEEPA and Treasury. I give<br />35% that the Supreme Court will affirm the Court<br />of Appeals ruling anf give Congress the power for<br />trade meausres/tarriffs.","Ana Valencia (20%): While the Supreme Court<br />might ultimately reverse the Court of Appeals’<br />ruling on tariffs, the probability of doing so<br />before November 25 is fairly low. SCOTUS’s high<br />rate of overturning appellate rulings and the<br />broad language of the IEEPA as reasons to expect<br />reversal but within this short time frame it is<br />unlikely. Given the Court’s procedural pace as<br />well as its reluctance to expand executive power<br />into tariff-making without explicit congressional<br />approval, there is also a precedent of expedited<br />cases that we can take into account. I give<br />a 20% chance because, although the Court has<br />occasionally issued rulings within days or weeks<br />in urgent constitutional crises, tariffs do not<br />rise to the same level of immediacy as the topics<br />of the other expedited cases. The justices still<br />need to review briefs, hear oral arguments,<br />deliberate, and draft opinions which can take<br />several weeks. Unless the Court treats this case<br />as a matter of national security on par with its<br />most expedited decisions, the odds of a final<br />ruling before late November remain slim.","Anna Barton-Caucci (30%): I think there is around<br />a 30% chance but It’s hard to say what the Supreme<br />Court will do because the justices often disagree<br />on cases about executive power. Some justices<br />might agree with the Appeals Court because the<br />law doesn’t clearly allow these tariffs. Other<br />justices could reverse it since presidents usually<br />have more freedom in emergencies or foreign<br />policy. Even though the Court is treating the case<br />as urgent, there still is no telling what will<br />actually end up happening.","Anna Kneser (22%): I believe that the Supreme<br />Court will reverse this case, but the question is<br />will they do that before November 25th? Trump v.<br />Hawaii is a very similar case, and it was decided<br />in just over five months. Therefore, I doubt that<br />the case will be reversed in 3 months time due to<br />the amount of briefs due and oral arguments that<br />need to occur. Even though the expedited procedure<br />was enacted under the Trump administration, many<br />other cases that have had this same procedure took<br />more than three months. However, because there<br />is more aggression and public upheaval toward<br />this reversal, there is always the possibility<br />that the timeline of this case will speed up, so<br />my prediction increased to 22%. However, I still<br />don't think it is likely.","Arshia Charkhian (15%): I am predicting a 15%<br />chance, since the Supreme Court still holds favor<br />toward the Trump administration, while Congress<br />clearly holds tariff authority and the Major<br />Questions Doctrine limits executive overreach.<br />However, there is a possibility the Supreme<br />Court may reinterpret IEEPA broadly and back<br />presidential tariff authority.","Blake Martin (23%): This case had a lot of<br />parallels to Trumps travel ban of banning people<br />from predominantly muslim countries and that<br />took 2 months and that was labeled as more of an<br />emergency than this one. With the length of this<br />decision I don't think it will happen. The stakes<br />of making the court comes with good decision and<br />taking their time to write out their decision<br />could take a long a very time. So therefore<br />I don't think they will have it overturned by<br />November 25th. However with enough pushback from<br />the public, the process can get sped up.","Breanne Talley (35%): The Supreme Court has agreed<br />to hear the tariff case, showing it wants to<br />clarify how much power the president has under<br />the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.<br />Still, a full reversal of the Court of Appeals’<br />7–4 ruling is unlikely. The lower court stressed<br />constitutional concerns about giving the president<br />too much unchecked authority, and the Supreme<br />Court has recently limited broad executive powers<br />through the “major questions” doctrine. While<br />the fast-track schedule shows urgency, it is more<br />likely the Court will affirm or slightly adjust<br />the ruling. Overall, the chance of reversal is<br />modest—about 35%.","Breanne Talley (25%): There is a possibility of<br />this happening since the case is expedited. Even<br />with these decisions, it can take days or even<br />weeks to come out. They are still not even going<br />to hear the case till the beginning of November,<br />so it would have to be a quick turnaround. With<br />this being a more intricate case, I don't think it<br />will be a quick decision.","Caleb Lux (40%): This prediction is more likely<br />than the time-limited counterpart, but I still<br />find it more likely than not that the court<br />will uphold the lower level ruling. The legal<br />argument seems to greatly benefit the current<br />standing on IEEPA, although it is far from certain<br />that this court will not blindly support this<br />administration's position.","Caleb Lux (25%): I find it unlikely that the court<br />at all will rule before this question resolves.<br />It will hear oral arguments on the case in early<br />November, but it could take up to 8 weeks before<br />a decision is released. Moreover, the legal<br />case surrounding Trump's tariffs is favorable to<br />upholding the Appellate Court's opinion. However,<br />the current high court has consistently found ways<br />to benefit the current administration regardless<br />of precedent or sound legal reasoning.","Caroline Mattox (30%): I think there is chance<br />that they reverse the ruling before November 25th<br />but because of the large amount of briefings and<br />arguments that they have to go through I just<br />don’t see a high chance of the decision being made<br />before that deadline which is why I chose the 30%.","Chris Haswell (52%): If the Supreme Court releases<br />a ruling before November 25, I am unsure if it<br />will be in President Trump's favor. To me, the<br />language is clear: a president cannot unilaterally<br />enact tariffs without Congressional approval.<br />However, I also didn't think presidents would be<br />immune from any action they committed in office,<br />so I'm not sure how the Court will rule. Usually<br />the court reverses appelate decisions, however<br />this one seems to have bipartisan support. I think<br />this decision is as close to 50-50 as it gets, and<br />I am only leaning towards an overturning of the<br />ruling because of the pro-Trump precedent that the<br />Court has established.","Chris Haswell (35%): I don't think we will see<br />a decision before November 25 because this case<br />does not appear to be an emergency, and the<br />Supreme Court usually takes longer than two weeks<br />to release a decision. If we do see a decision,<br />I think there is a good chance that the Supreme<br />Court rules in favor of Trump and overturns<br />the ruling given their history of backing his<br />executive actions. However, this case seems<br />especially legally dubious, given the wide backing<br />of conservative scholars against the President.<br />This makes me think that the Court will take a<br />while to deliberate, ultimately postponing the<br />decision until after November 25.","Cierra Green (40%): The court has historically<br />shown to be reluctant in expanding the president's<br />powers in these types of situations. Specifically,<br />the Supreme Court would be less inclined to grant<br />powers for tariffs. These powers better align<br />with Congress. However, 6 of the justices lean<br />conservative, 3 of which were appointed by Trump.<br />Therefore, they may be more inclined to support<br />him. My score is less confident because there<br />is not a time limit on it. If given more time<br />(other than a November 25 deadline), the court is<br />technically more likely to reverse the appeal.","Cierra Green (25%): Due to the timeline of typical<br />Supreme Court rulings, it is unlikely that the<br />decision would be made by the deadline of November<br />25th. Although the court has granted the right to<br />expedite, they still must go through briefings,<br />oral arguments, and discussions to the final<br />decision. This process can take months. Also, the<br />Supreme Court has historically been reluctant to<br />grant powers such as this to the president since<br />that is more so the power of Congress.","Elizabeth Nelson (12%): I think because of<br />the complexity of the cases and arguments and<br />briefings that it will likely take months for<br />this to be settled/resolved, and even though<br />it has been scheduled to begin the first week<br />of November, I think with so many other factors<br />playing into the presentation and execution of<br />this case it will not happen before November 25th.","Francesca Mariano (60%): The current SCOTUS is<br />known for not respecting precedent and overturning<br />decisions from the Court of Appeals. It is also<br />majority conservative, with six of the nine<br />Justices being conservative, three of these having<br />been appointed by Trump. SCOTUS recently reached<br />a decision that immigration status could lawfully<br />be inquired about based on race, displaying<br />the extent to which they will simply not follow<br />precedent, and arguably the Constitution itself.<br />The IEEPA, the legislation under which Trump<br />enacted the tariffs, potentially has vague<br />language that could allow for Trump's actions, but<br />the Court of Appeals ruled that enacting tariffs<br />of this nature is expressly a Congressional issue.<br />Yet, predicting how some of the less originalist<br />Justices will sway is a challenge. Given the<br />unpredictability of the SCOTUS and its recent<br />history of not upholding previous rulings and<br />aligning with Trump, I predict a probability of<br />60% that SCOTUS will reverse the Court of Appeal's<br />ruling on tariffs.","Francesca Mariano (23%): Given that the oral<br />arguments for this case are not set to begin<br />until the first week of November, I do not think<br />the court will reach a decision by November 25th.<br />Consolidated cases such as this one already take<br />longer, and even when consolidated cases are<br />expedited, they take longer than non-consolidated<br />cases. A similar case SCOTUS saw under the first<br />Trump administration took about two months, so I<br />find it safe to assume that they will not reach a<br />decision in less than a month. I also think that<br />because this case is so controversial, SCOTUS may<br />intentionally take its time. I also acknowledge<br />the unpredictability of the current administration<br />and SCOTUS. Combining these factors and the<br />probability provided by my peers, I think there<br />is a 23% chance SCOTUS will reverse the Court of<br />Appeal's ruling on tariffs before November 25.","Ellie Null (25%): I predict that there will be<br />a 25% chance of the US Supreme Court reversing<br />the Court of Appeal's ruling on tariffs before<br />November 25. I think there are a lot of high<br />stakes cases that have been expedited and cases<br />like this that have been and still took longer.<br />Furthermore, getting an oral argument to the point<br />of full decision in less than three weeks would<br />be a fast timeline for the supreme court. They<br />have also not indicated that they are on track or<br />gunning for this fast-paced decision making even<br />though it's been expedited. They normally take<br />about 6-8 weeks unless it is a state of emergency<br />decision. In conclusion I predict that there is<br />around a 25% chance of reversal by the Supreme<br />Court. There is so much polarization around this<br />decision so I presume that there will be a lot<br />of debate and time dedicated to this decision.<br />However there is always room for developments.<br />so it's not to say it won't happen, it just might<br />take longer due to the fact that there is a lot of<br />pushback.","Jack Lutz (63%): The Supreme Court is set to hear<br />oral arguments starting on the first of November.<br />A turnaround involving arguments, deliberation,<br />and putting out an official statement will likely<br />take more than the 3 weeks that stand between the<br />opening and this question's deadline. I do not<br />see this question as being seen as a 'necessary'<br />expedited case, which are often wrapped up in<br />2-3 weeks, so it will likely extend into December<br />before a ruling is given.","Jack Lutz (37%): The Supreme Court is set to hear<br />oral arguments starting on the first of November.<br />A turnaround involving arguments, deliberation,<br />and putting out an official statement will likely<br />take more than the 3 weeks that stand between the<br />opening and this question's deadline. I do not<br />see this question as being seen as a 'necessary'<br />expedited case, which are often wrapped up in<br />2-3 weeks, so it will likely extend into December<br />before a ruling is given.","Jackson Bost (55%): The current Roberts Court<br />relies heavily upon originalist interpretations of<br />the Constitution, meaning that they seek to rule<br />based on what they think the Founders intended.<br />This has been reflected in cases like West<br />Virginia v. EPA, where Justice Gorsuch issued a<br />concurring opinion that heavily based its decision<br />upon the separation of powers. This, though, does<br />not mean that SCOTUS is in the habit of upholding<br />cases. In Trump v. US, Chief Justice Roberts<br />upheld Youngstown's idea in the majority opinion<br />that Congress and presidents can have concurring<br />authority if it comes from an authorization<br />by Congress. The IEEPA gives the President<br />emergency powers over transactions, which could<br />give SCOTUS a path to rule against the Appeals<br />decision--especially considering that the Court<br />has undone injunctions and upheld spending freezes<br />in the un-originalist name of efficiency.","Jackson Bost (35%): While a ruling overturning<br />the Court of Appeals' decision would have a<br />number of implications for international trade<br />and the President's policy agenda, SCOTUS is not<br />particularly concerned with our timeline, and<br />there seems to be little reason to issue a ruling<br />on this case as soon as possible. Of the major<br />expedited cases, three related to wars, two with<br />government accountability, and one election, and<br />all of them were sudden events requiring sudden<br />decisions. Only one had a background that started<br />more than two months prior and was decided quickly<br />enough to fit our timeframe: Dames & Moore v.<br />Regan. That case, though, was decided under one of<br />the most activist courts in history on the ground<br />of Congress's \"acquiescence,\" a fairly subjective<br />ruling. This case, which has been in the news for<br />some time without jumping directly to SCOTUS, now<br />comes in front of an originalist court that will<br />need more time to consider the full depth of the<br />Constitution.","James Hunter Darke (58%): I would say that they<br />will reverse the decision due to the makeup of<br />the court. However, I am still very uncertain<br />when this may happen. It all depends on how much<br />weight they give the major questions doctrine,<br />and whether they believe Congress gave implicit<br />authority etc.","James Hunter Darke (40%): I would have to say no<br />for the November 25th deadline. I do not think<br />that this is enough time for the court to fully<br />evaluate and make a decsision to reverse it in<br />such a short time period. We all know how long<br />court precodures take, and with a conservative<br />court, they will likely try to push this off. With<br />a longer time frame my answer will be different,<br />but in such a short time frame, I do not think it<br />happens.","Jhaycee Barnes (55%): The Court fast-tracked the<br />case, which shows they’re at least open to the<br />government’s side. Plus, SCOTUS has a history<br />of siding with presidents in cases dealing with<br />economic issues and foreign affairs like Dames<br />& Moore v. Regan, Regan v. Wald, and Trump v.<br />Hawaii. Still, the Appeals Court leaned on the<br />Court’s own major questions doctrine, and since<br />Congress didn't spell out that IEEPA covers<br />tariffs, some justices may hesitate to hand the<br />president unlimited tariff power.","Jhaycee Barnes (25%): Arguments for the case<br />are set for early November, and that gives 2<br />weeks for everything to happen by November 25th.<br />After looking at Amanda's research on previously<br />expedited cases, it doesn't seem likely that the<br />court will issue an opinion in that short amount<br />of time. But they have moved at high speeds in<br />rare situations, and with billions at stake, all<br />that market uncertainty could push them to act<br />quicker this time.","Kira Fleischer (28%): The conservative legal<br />establishment argues against this use of IEPA, so<br />looking at the specific facts of this case, I do<br />not think it is likely. I think even it if were<br />to be overturned, that happening before November<br />25th is unlikely. Courts take a while to make<br />decisions, and with no time limit on this one,<br />I think the court will takes it s time to decide<br />(and eventually decide to uphold the decision).","Kristoffer Fields (38%): While this is much harder<br />question to answer because it does not set a dated<br />timeline on the lift. While the SUPREME court has<br />taken the request on an expedited schedule I still<br />find it unlikely to occur due to various legal<br />issues at play such as the supreme courts idea of<br />what a tariff and the seperation and delegation of<br />powers in the US government","Kristoffer Fields (20%): While I think this is<br />a very big economic issue at the moment I have<br />a deep lack of faith in how fast the American<br />legal process works plus our current head of state<br />is very against the topic. So I would place it<br />unlikely but not certainly unlikely, 20 percent.","Liz Yancey (57%): Considering this is more of a<br />conservative court, I think they will rule with<br />the President. I think it depends on how they will<br />go forward, defining \"emergencies\" as well. I'm<br />iffy on whether they will consider the reactionary<br />tariffs constitutional because, on their face,<br />they seem based on other concerns not rooted in<br />national security measures. The fentanyl argument<br />seems fine and could be justifiable.","Liz Yancey (45%): SCOTUS won't issue a decision by<br />Nov. 25, but if they do, I bet they will overturn<br />the appellate court decision. Even if they<br />expedite it, they still have to deliberate, and<br />that can take days or weeks. The court being more<br />conservative signals to me that they are likely to<br />eventually overturn the decision.","Manuv Datta (25%): There is a 75 percent chance<br />of no ruling by November 25 because the Court<br />granted review on September 9, set briefing<br />through October 30, and scheduled argument in<br />early November, leaving little time for a signed<br />opinion. The en banc Federal Circuit ruling, the<br />major questions doctrine, and competing readings<br />tied to Curtiss Wright and Dames and Moore create<br />cross pressures that slow consensus. The justices<br />can manage uncertainty with interim orders, which<br />do not resolve the merits.","Manuv Datta (30%): There is a 70 percent chance<br />of a ruling by November 25 that rejects Trump’s<br />position because the expedited schedule signals<br />urgency, and the path of least resistance is<br />to affirm that IEEPA does not clearly authorize<br />tariffs. Tariffs look like taxes that belong to<br />Congress, and the Court has recently demanded<br />clear authorization for sweeping economic actions.<br />The Federal Circuit’s reasoning provides a ready<br />blueprint. A short judgment could issue quickly<br />after argument, with opinions to follow, limiting<br />uncertainty while preserving separation of powers.","Mateo Ceron (85%): I think that the Supreme Court<br />will reverse the decision made by the Court of<br />Appeals. While it all relies on how they intend<br />to use IEEPA and what sections of it apply to<br />the tariffs, I think the Supreme Court has sided<br />with the Trump administration in a couple of<br />controversial decisions. Therefore, I am more<br />confident that the Supreme Court will rule in<br />favor of a reversal of the decision made by the<br />Court of Appeals.","Mateo Ceron (28%): I don't think that the Supreme<br />Court will reverse the decision before November<br />25th. Although there has been an appeal for<br />an expedited process, the oral arguments don't<br />happen until November 1st. That leaves a very slim<br />timeline for the Court to reach its decision. The<br />only time that anything has had that quick of a<br />turnaround has been the Tik Tok case, but I'm not<br />sure it would happen again","Nic Curtis (70%): With no time limit set on this<br />question, I feel much more confident answering<br />\"yes\" to this question. I think that the Supreme<br />Court will end up reversing the lower courts<br />decision on tariffs. One of the briefings<br />mentioned that nearly 75% of appealed cases are<br />over turned by the court. While this may be less<br />with cases regarding tariffs or taxes, it seems<br />to me that the Court has recently struck down<br />other federal judges orders regarding the Trump<br />administrations actions. This is common as the<br />Court usually \"grants\" the president authority<br />when they attempt to push the limit of their<br />powers.","Nic Curtis (45%): I think that the Supreme Court<br />will end up reversing the lower courts decision<br />on tariffs.

This is common as the Court usually<br />\"grants\" the president authority when they attempt<br />to push the limit. The only reason my probability<br />is lower is that I think that it is less likely<br />that the court release their decision prior to<br />November 25. I do not think that the case is a<br />big enough emergency to warrant a quick decision<br />following oral arguments.","Owen Johnston (40%): I give a probability of 40%.<br />The main reasons the Court would reverse would be<br />its tendency to side with Trump. However, I think<br />the more textualist Justices such as Gorsuch and<br />Coney Barrett would actually agree with the COA<br />decision, because the IEEPA due to the lack of<br />explicit language authorizing this Presidential<br />power. I then think the three \"liberal\" Justices<br />would vote to keep the COA ruling. This alone<br />gives 5 votes in agreement with the Circuit<br />Court. However, it is still likely that this<br />\"conservative\" court, the same one that ruled<br />presidential immunity exists, would reverse and<br />give Trump this power to execute one of his key<br />policy goals.","Owen Johnston (25%): I give the probability of<br />25% mainly just due to the timeline constraints.<br />Regardless of what decision the court will make,<br />I find it more likely than not that the Court<br />will release their decision regarding tariffs by<br />November 25th. For example, Trump v. Hawaii took<br />two months to decide.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (75%): I would<br />put the chance at about 75% that the Supreme Court<br />will eventually reverse the Court of Appeals’<br />ruling on tariffs. The Court’s conservative<br />majority has often leaned toward giving presidents<br />broad authority in national security and foreign<br />affairs, and it tends to overturn a lot of<br />appellate decisions. So I think reversal is more<br />likely than not.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (30%): I would<br />put the chance at about 30% that the Supreme<br />Court will reverse the Court of Appeals’ ruling<br />on tariffs before November 25. The case is on<br />a fast track with arguments scheduled for early<br />November. I think the Court usually takes longer<br />to work through this kind of case that deals<br />with separation-of-powers. On one hand, precedent<br />points to caution about expanding presidential<br />authority under the IEEPA, but on the other<br />hand, the conservative majority and the Court’s<br />pattern of overturning lower court rulings open<br />the possibility for a reversal. I think a ruling<br />reversing the case is possible but within that<br />time frame is kind of unlikely.","Ruhi Doddamani (30%): SCOTUS is not going to be<br />able to get that reversal through in time, even<br />withTrump granted them that expedited procedure.<br />Also, he's dragging their attention elsewhere with<br />all these deportations being declared unlawful by<br />the state courts. Decisions are published mid-next<br />year, which is past our timeline.","Ryan Marx (25%): I believe that there is only a<br />25% chance of the supreme court reverse the court<br />of appeals ruling on tariffs because historically<br />speaking the supreme court has been reluctant<br />to allow the executive branch to make greater<br />decisions on tariffs and other economic decisions<br />that might strip power from the legislative<br />branch. Also, with the oral arguments scheduled<br />for early November and the time it takes for<br />deliberation and a decision to be written, I<br />believe that there is only a 25% chance of the<br />decision being reversed before nov.25.","Sade Ezekiel (57%): I believe there is a great<br />chance that the Supreme Court will reverse<br />the court of appeals ruling on taxes in the<br />near future. Most of the court is made up of<br />conservatives which gives President Trump an<br />advantage. I think that the court will grant<br />access to the president allowing him to impose the<br />taxes under IEEPA legally.","Sade Ezekiel (34%): I believe that there will be a<br />low chance that the US Supreme Court will reverse<br />the court of Appeals on tariffs before November<br />25th because it is stated in the constitution that<br />taxes rely solely on the legislative branch. This<br />means that the President does not have the right<br />to impose taxes on IEEPA because it is not under<br />his jurisdiction. While there is a chance that the<br />Supreme Court will reverse the ruling due to most<br />of the court being conservative; I believe that<br />this will not happen before November 25th.","Sarah Kate Maher (30%): I put 30 mostly so as to<br />not seem so confident, but I really don't think<br />it will happen. As someone said in their brief,<br />the Supreme Court always defers to the current<br />president and I think a lot of the Court's recent<br />decisions really follow that. I think that the<br />Court will see the tarriffs as within presidential<br />power, though some justices may oppose the<br />tarriffs ideologically or on a constitutional<br />level.","Sarah Kate Maher (20%): The briefings alone in<br />this case may take us right up to the deadline for<br />this question to resolve as yes. Though this is<br />an expedited case, it is not high stakes enough<br />to be decided by the end of the semester. So I<br />think purely for timeline reasons, it's not going<br />to happen. I also think that with everything else<br />going on, public pressure will decline immensely<br />and tarriffs will not be at the forefront of<br />peoples' minds, allowing the Supreme Court to push<br />the decision back even further.","Sasha Mahtani (20%): I do not think that the US<br />Supreme Court will reverse the Court of Appeals<br />ruling on tariffs before November 25th as that<br />leaves a very short window to make the ruling. As<br />we discussed in class, the Supreme Court takes the<br />shortest amount of time in rulings when the cases<br />are more high stakes. Based on the timeline of<br />these previous cases, it is highly likely that it<br />will get pushed back and will not be reversed by<br />November 25th.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (20%): While the Supreme Court<br />reversing the Court of Appeal's decision before<br />November 25 is a near impossibility, a reversal<br />by the end of this semester is a more difficult<br />question. Although there is time now to find out,<br />I still find it unlikely the Supreme Court will<br />rule against the Court of Appeal's very strong<br />case that Trump's tariffs violate constitutional<br />authority. I don't believe the Supreme Court<br />currently has sufficient reason to disagree with<br />the ruling.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (10%): Before the question of<br />the Supreme Court reversing the Court of Appeal's<br />ruling at all should even be considered, the fact<br />that it must happen before November 25 renders<br />this highly unlikely. The Supreme Court is slow<br />to action already and a certiorari does not fall<br />too high on national priority. Reversing this<br />ruling would take months of deliberation and<br />argumentation before we could see a reversal,<br />making November 25 too soon of a deadline.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (90%): I predict that the<br />Supreme Court will overturn the court of appeals<br />ruling.

Trump appointed 3<br />of the 9 justices, and 6 of the 9 currently on<br />the Court are considered conservative. Given<br />this ideological makeup and partisan pressures, I<br />think the case will be overturned to preserve the<br />tariffs and allow later ones to be levied.

Based on statistical data I<br />found, the US Supreme Court has a 60-70% reversal<br />rate when it comes to Court of Appeal decisions.<br />There is also a 6-3 conservative majority, which<br />could help to rule in favor of Trump’s tariffs and<br />use of IEEPA. With that being said, I believe it<br />is more likely to see this happen than the last<br />prediction, but I still don’t think it will 100%<br />occur. Also, when it comes to the conservative<br />majority, that doesn’t always do much because<br />most issues deal with upholding the law and<br />constitution over individual political beliefs or<br />affiliations. I am sitting at a 40% chance that<br />there will be a reversal of the Court of Appeal’s<br />ruling.","Zafar Ali (18%): Based on my own research in<br />combination with the briefings, it seems as<br />though the likelihood for this prediction are<br />fairly low. There are many factors to account<br />for, however, the main thing that makes me think<br />this is unlikely is the timeframe having to be<br />before November 25th. In the past, rulings dealing<br />with IEEPA have tended to be deemed more urgent<br />for the reason that they were viewed within the<br />realm of national security. Trump’s use of IEEPA<br />was broad and not necessarily in this group of<br />urgency. Because of that, I believe that the US<br />Supreme Court will take their time with this case.<br />They have said that they will start hearings in<br />November, however, that does not necessarily mean<br />they will have a decision within a few weeks. It<br />is likely to take a few months which exceeds the<br />time range given.

As a city<br />known to vote blue and support everything counter<br />to Trump's agenda, Adams is not someone the<br />people want to vote for again. Furthermore, both<br />Mamdani and Cuomo are doing better and have higher<br />approval ratings than the current mayor. And while<br />being an incumbent is something that typically<br />helps your chances in an election, Adams' many<br />charges regarding corruption, paired with the<br />growing sentiment that his current term hasn't<br />brought about any changes, make it highly possible<br />that he will lose the race. That being said, the<br />main reason he hasn't officially dropped out yet<br />could be because he doesn't want to see Mamdani<br />win or Cuomo get his remaining votes/support.<br />He could be holding out until the last second to<br />cause as much damage to the other two candidates<br />since its known fact that he has no chance of<br />winning. That is why even though I believe he will<br />drop out, it also makes sense for him to prolong<br />his official withdrawal, and why I placed my<br />probability so low.","Alizah Mudaliar (38%): I believe there is a 38%<br />chance that Adams drops out of the New York City<br />mayoral race. Given the current poll results,<br />Adams has a low chance of winning the election,<br />but he plans to remain in the race despite these<br />results. By the end of the month, he will likely<br />say whether he will remain in the race based<br />on his independently conducted poll. His public<br />statement of his commitment to the race and the<br />people of New York City as well as running as<br />an independent candidate provides him with some<br />leverage among other groups of people in the city.<br />If external pressures dramatically increase, like<br />Trump having a definite federal job proposal, the<br />likelihood of withdrawal increases significantly.<br />Whether Adams stays in the mayoral race hinges<br />on shifting political calculations such as poll<br />results and federal pressures.","Amanda Neighbour (40%): Despite having no<br />incentive to stay in the race, I believe it is<br />possible that Eric Adams' stubbornness will carry<br />him to election day. His team has denied the<br />allegations of \"dropping out,\" however, they are<br />doing \"internal polling.\" I believe since he is on<br />the ballot already, he will continue to campaign.<br />His reasoning for dropping out would be to prevent<br />Mamdani from winning by giving his votes to Cuomo,<br />but, just last week he was on record calling Cuomo<br />\"a snake and liar.\" It comes to the question if he<br />hates socialism or Cuomo more, but this highlights<br />how he believes he is the only one apt to the job<br />and is staying in the race. Dropping out after he<br />says he is going to stay will make him look bad,<br />but it is also possible that he drops out because<br />he is losing the the republican candidate, to make<br />the race less tight, or because of Trump's job he<br />offered.","Ana Valencia (60%): Given the current average<br />predictions of prediction market websites, I<br />decided to place this at a median of 60%. I also<br />accounted for average polling numbers for his<br />mayoral race where most New Yorkers place Mandami<br />27 places above Adams on the race if Cuomo were<br />to drop out. It seems the higher chances for a<br />conservative leaning candidate for the race to<br />win would be Cuomo since he is 15% trailing in the<br />race compared to the 34% difference for Adams in<br />a race where Mandami leads by 43%. Also, the Adams<br />campaign just announced that it will conduct an<br />independent poll to measure the campaign viability<br />but given the current results on various polling<br />sources, it seems thay he will he would only find<br />9-12% of support through polling. He has also lost<br />support from major political figures like Trump,<br />leading to dwindling fundraising efforts in an<br />election where his main opponent is not Mandami<br />but Cuomo","Anna Barton-Caucci (60%): I think the probability<br />is around 60% because his approval rating is<br />around 20% which is very low and it seems very<br />unlikely that he could win this election. However,<br />I think there is a chance that even though he<br />knows his odds are slim, he may still stay in the<br />race for his own reputation/campaign's legacy.","Anna Kneser (45%): Eric Adams will not win the<br />election, so why not drop out? At the same time,<br />why drop out? He will be on the ballot anyway no<br />matter if he drops out or not. However, he did<br />make a private comment that he is going to conduct<br />a private poll, and based on those results,<br />he will decide whether to drop out or not.<br />Personally, I see no reason for him to be running<br />if he is not going to win because he is going to<br />waste money campaigning. Therefore, my prediction<br />is very inconsistent and I can see him dropping<br />out or staying in. The ultimate decision factor<br />for me is Adams' dislike for Cuomo. I think he<br />will stay in simply to sway votes away from Cuomo.<br />Therefore, that puts my prediction a little under<br />50% at 45%.","Arshia Charkhian (65%): With Zohran in a prime<br />position after being elected as the Democratic<br />nominee, I do not see much incentive for Eric<br />Adams to continue his campaign. Given his past<br />controversies and lack of Trump’s backing to be<br />able to fight Zohran, I give a 65% chance he will<br />drop out.","Blake Martin (59%): I gave this prediction a 59%<br />percent chance of happening because Eric Adams<br />has no incentive to stay in the race. The polls<br />of him winning are extremely low across multiple<br />sources and I believe that he is going to drop<br />out closer to election day so that he can keep<br />votes away from his competitors. However, he did<br />confirm he is going to continue to campaign and<br />he has stated he is committed to New York since he<br />is the current mayor there. Therefore because of<br />his stubborness I am not extremely confident in my<br />probability.","Breanne Talley (40%): I list my probability at<br />40 percent because him dropping out now would<br />not take his name off the ballet. He has openly<br />discussed his dislike for the other candidates as<br />well so I don't feel like he would openly endorse<br />them telling his supporters to vote for them. Even<br />though his polling is low, I think he will stick<br />it out till the end to show New York he still<br />cares.","Caleb Lux (90%): There's been a lot of<br />conversations and rumors that Adams will drop out<br />by even the end of the week, and I find them to<br />come from credible reasons. Adams will not win,<br />but he stands the best chance at beating Mamdani<br />and/or finding a spot in the Trump admin if he<br />drops out.","Chris Haswell (65%): I am not extremely confident<br />that Adams will drop out of the race, but it seems<br />more likely than not. Traditionally, it doesn't<br />make much sense for a losing candidate to continue<br />spending money on a race that he knows he won't<br />win. Eric Adams is more than a little egotistical<br />though, so it is entirely possible that he decides<br />to stay in. However, I think he'd want to do<br />anything in his power to hurt Zohran Mamdami,<br />and that would mean dropping out. I wouldn't be<br />shocked either way, which is why my probability is<br />relatively low.","Cierra Green (68%): Eric Adams will lose the<br />election, so he has no good reason to stay in the<br />race other than his pride. However, he would face<br />backlash for dropping out rather than sticking<br />to it in the end which may damage his image. He<br />has the incentive to drop out in order to endorse<br />Cuomo and defeat Mamdani. Although his image<br />is important, I believe his goal of defeating<br />Mamdani is stronger. Additionally, both Kalshi and<br />Polymarket show a 68% chance of him dropping out.","Elizabeth Nelson (60%): Based on polling, Adams<br />is consistently in single digits and is far behind<br />Mamdani, Cuomo, and even Sliwa. This alone is<br />not a good starting point for Adams, so adding<br />on his scandals and baggage that he carries due<br />to corruption charges, there is a deep distrust<br />and low approval ratings despite the charges<br />being dropped. I think it is pretty evident that<br />Adams will in one way or another suspend active<br />campaigning and possibly endorsing Cuomo in order<br />to maintain some dignity. But, this could go both<br />ways, as he likely wants to avoid the humiliation<br />of conceding early, so I think it will ultimately<br />depend on how badly he wants to retain his image<br />and leverage in NYC and even nationally. The only<br />thing that is making me a little worried is how he<br />has framed himself as a \"fighter,\" and certainly<br />has a track record of defiance.","Francesca Mariano (40%): Eric Adams announced<br />earlier today that he will continue campaigning<br />and has events set up. Adams will be on the<br />ballot no matter what, but he can still announce<br />that he is dropping out. Adams said his campaign<br />will be doing a private poll that will determine<br />if he stays in the race, but supposedly, his<br />spokespeople and team have denied this. Adams<br />has experienced career-ending scandals, including<br />international bribery and large-scale corruption,<br />scandals that turned into federal charges that<br />were reportedly dropped with the help of Trump's<br />hand. Trump has also offered Adams a job, which<br />he is reportedly not wanting to take. I feel it<br />is also important to note that the front-runner<br />behind Mamdani is Cuomo, who has also experienced<br />a career-ending scandal and is still going strong<br />in the race. Briefs have probabilities ranging<br />from 38 to 70, with a majority on the higher<br />end. I would have to place myself on the lower<br />end. To me, Adams is a man with nothing to lose,<br />international scandals, national intrigue, dropped<br />federal charges, and a very interesting digital<br />footprint. I see no glaring reason for his desire<br />to drop out; he has continued to run and make<br />statements that he will run despite all of this.<br />For this reason, I place the probability that<br />Adams will drop out of the NYC mayoral race at 40.","Ellie Null (40%): I predict that there is a 40<br />% chance that he will drop out of the race. It<br />does not seem in his character to drop out of<br />the race. He doesn't really have the public vote<br />and he lost the primary vote. He lined up worse<br />than republican and New Yorkers don't tend to<br />vote republican. I think he should drop out but<br />it might be closer to election day. He has a<br />lower chance of winning but it won’t play into<br />his decision to drop out. From these facts it's<br />either about helping Andrew Cuomo and hurting<br />Zohran Mamdani. It’s all about who he hates more.<br />As an incumbent I think he will also be more<br />likely to stay to show his morals and stand on his<br />principles. I would not be surprised if he stayed<br />or did not. It is all about what matters most to<br />him more - New York and stopping Mamdani or his<br />principles.","Hunter Murray (45%): I believe that Eric Adams is<br />under significant pressure from a strange alliance<br />of the Trump Admin, Andrew Cuomo, and some of the<br />major land developers in NYC to drop out of the<br />race for mayor. However, I think he also under a<br />tremendous amount of pressure from other people<br />in city hall, his major donors, and people in<br />the DNC to remain in the race. I am going back to<br />the basics, the marble equivalency test. Based on<br />that, and everything that I’ve read and know about<br />NYC politics and this mayoral race, I feel just<br />slightly confident that he WILL drop out of the<br />race (in between 4-5 marbles).","Jack Lutz (55%): Adams has already passed the<br />point of no-return, being that his name will<br />appear on the ballot for the upcoming election.<br />However, whether he will still campaign is up<br />in the air. While he strongly dislikes opponent<br />Cuomo, he seems even more determined to keep<br />Mamdani from the race. However, he is quite a<br />stubborn man and unafraid of consequences, so his<br />course of action remains muddy.","Jackson Bost (56%): I could see Adams accepting<br />a federal position once we get a little closer<br />to October and once the writing on the wall is<br />as clear as it possibly can be to him. A renewed<br />effort by Trump to reduce spoilers ahead of the<br />election in his fight against Mamdani, potentially<br />manifesting itself as an October Surprise.<br />Sticking to it all the way through the could be<br />seen as political suicide, but for someone with<br />a stubborn reputation and a slew of corruption<br />charges against him, political suicide isn't the<br />scariest thing.","James Hunter Darke (60%): Yes I believe he<br />will drop out of the Mayoral race. His polling<br />at record low numbers, and rumors are already<br />swirling that he might. He has absolutely no<br />chance to win. His only chance at saving his<br />political career is to dropout and take a job with<br />Trump or Cuomo. The only way that happens is if he<br />drops out.","Jhaycee Barnes (60%): Overall, Adams' campaign<br />looks really bad. He's polling terribly and inside<br />sources are saying withdrawing is on the table.<br />A lot of people are telling him to step aside<br />because he is splitting the anti-Mamdani vote.<br />On the other hand, incumbents rarely drop out<br />even when they are unpopular (Lori Lightfoot and<br />Bill de Blasio come to mind) and Adams is known<br />for being stubborn which makes it less likely<br />that he will fold under pressure. While it is<br />historically unlikely that incumbents quit, Adams<br />does have a lot of strong pressures on him and<br />even speculations that are pointing to a drop out.","Kira Fleischer (56%): Eric Adams does not have<br />incentive to keep running. Despite being the<br />incumbent mayor, he does not even make top 3<br />candidates. His voter base does not even support<br />him at this point. I think he ultimately will drop<br />out, however, later in the race. He also is more<br />likely to get a position in the Trump or Cuomo in<br />administration to drop out. He also stated that he<br />loves NY more than he hates Cuomo.","Kristoffer Fields (45%): I think there are clear<br />implication for why he should drop out of the<br />race, elite pressures, other political actors<br />urging him to and his disdain for the other<br />candidates plus his extremely low approval rating.<br />However just because it is something he should do<br />does not mean he will do it in fear of tainting<br />his image or reputation to the people of New York","Liz Yancey (68%): I think Adams will drop out<br />eventually, given his severe unpopularity.<br />However, I could still see him saying it just to<br />try and draw votes away from Mamdani, but even<br />then, if he drops out, those votes would go to<br />Cuomo and could sway the polls even more, despite<br />there being a clear frontrunner already. I think<br />it would be smarter for him to drop out, but I<br />don't know if he feels the same way","Manuv Datta (75%): I predict that YES, there<br />is a 75% likelihood of Eric Adams dropping out<br />of the NYC mayoral race. I make this prediction<br />based on the internal view of Eric Adam's tenure<br />and reputation as NYC mayor, reports on his<br />conversations with donors behind closed doors,<br />and the external view the DNC establishment and<br />its persuasive power it might have on Eric Adams<br />dropping out, to best support Cuomo and his<br />election efforts.","Mateo Ceron (58%): The only thing stopping me<br />from going any higher in this prediction is the<br />stubborn nature of the incumbent. Mayor Adams<br />will not withdraw from this race based off the<br />fact that he is going to lose alone. He certainly<br />believes that he is the candidate (of anyone<br />else) that will beat Mamdani. However, Cuomo also<br />believes that he is the candidate that will beat<br />Mamdani. Cuomo is more favored in the polls, so<br />the only way I see Adams dropping out of the race<br />before election night is if the two candidates<br />somehow come to an agreement and Adams agrees to<br />drop to try to consolidate all the \"anti-Mamdani\"<br />votes under the more popular Cuomo. However, this<br />isn't too likely in my opinion because Adams is on<br />record calling him a liar and a snake.","Nic Curtis (68%): My feelings on this topic<br />have changed a lot. Last week, I was almost near<br />certain that he would drop out and I expected<br />research for my briefing to support this notion.<br />However, the research showed mixed feelings and<br />so did my classmates briefings. Eric Adams has<br />no incentive to stay in the race. If his main<br />goal is to defeat Mumdani, then it would make<br />sense to drop out of the race now and coalesce<br />his supporters to vote for Cuomo, no matter there<br />differences. In addition to that, he has given<br />some hints on dropping out to business leaders of<br />New York City. If he were to drop out, he may also<br />earn a spot in the Cuomo or Trump Administration.<br />But Eric Adams is not a rational actor. He may<br />stay in because of his dislike for Cuomo or just<br />straight stubbornness and pride despite polling<br />extremely low. Because of this, I am hesitant to<br />go above 70%","Owen Johnston (65%): I think Adams knows that<br />he is all but certain to lose this race. He is<br />polling behind even the Republican nominee. Adams<br />also is no fan of the Democratic nominee, Mamdani.<br />Adams, knowing he will lose and disliking Mamdani,<br />I believe is more likely than not to drop out in<br />order to help Cuomo, who is polling second and<br />would likely receive the majority of the vote from<br />Adams supporters if Adams were to withdraw.","Paul Frilingos (63%): All signs have been pointing<br />to him dropping out, but Eric Adams may be too<br />stubborn for that to happen. He repeatedly denies<br />any possibility of him leaving the race. There<br />is this news story about how there are certain<br />megadonors backing him which may keep him in the<br />race, and he also has a strong dislike for Cuomo,<br />who would benefit from dropping out. Still, with<br />his chances slim, he may take a deal from Trump<br />or another party that wishes to stop Mamdani from<br />winning.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (60%): I think<br />there is a 60% chance that Eric Adams drops out<br />of the New York City mayoral race. His polling<br />and approval ratings are very low and he is<br />losing funding and key endorsement. He also faces<br />mounting pressure from political elites. According<br />to reports, Trump wants him out to consolidate<br />support behind Andrew Cuomo. Even though Adams<br />continues to insist he is staying in, these<br />pressures make it more likely than not that he<br />will eventually step aside before Election Day.","Reese Fabritius (55%): After hearing and reading<br />everything, I think it is only slightly more<br />likely that he will drop out. Even though it is<br />not in his best interest because he will lose, I<br />do believe it could be strategic for him to drop<br />out and endorse Cuomo. I think taht because his<br />team has been so adamant, it would look bad it<br />they reversed that. I think if he were planning<br />on dropping out soon, they would instead avoid the<br />question. However, politicians are not known for<br />their honesty, and it is most logical for him to<br />drop out.","Ruhi Doddamani (45%): The two greatest factors I'm<br />trying to weight here are the rumors of Adam's'<br />team and his outward benefits of dropping out of<br />the race, as in what it would do to his standing<br />on the ballot. Because dropping out would keep<br />his name on the ballot still, he'd just have to<br />tell his supporters to stop funding him and to not<br />vote for him, which I think is highly unlikely.<br />Publicly, I think he's going to keep to the notion<br />that he's the only one who can defeat Mamdani.","Ryan Marx (20%): I believe that there is around<br />a 20% chance that Eric Adams will Drop out of<br />the New York Mayoral race. My reasoning is that<br />first and foremost, the former Mayor is polling<br />at around 9% currently in the race compared to<br />main opponent Mandami at 46%. Even his republican<br />opponent Silwa is polling at around 15 percent,<br />this is especially concerning as traditionally<br />New York city has leaned heavily Democrat.<br />Furthermore, there are rumors circling about<br />that President Donald Trump has been trying to<br />lure Adams out of the Race with the position of<br />Ambassador to Saudia Arabia, all of these factors<br />combined leads me to believe that while there are<br />factors decreasing Adam's possibility of winning<br />election. He has come out on multiple occasions<br />committing to staying on the race personally<br />debunking the alleged govt position offered by<br />Trump as well as continuing to Campaign against<br />Cuomo and Mandami with vigor. There for in the<br />event of Dropping out of the race, i believe there<br />to be only a 20 percent chance.","Sade Ezekiel (39%): While it is likely, I believe<br />that there will be a low chance that Eric Adams<br />will drop out of the New York City mayoral race.<br />Because of Adams's scandal over the past year,<br />many people in the city have been skeptical of<br />him getting elected for mayor once more. Adams<br />is running as an independent due to not being<br />selected as the democratic nominee. His opponent,<br />Mamdani, is set to have the greatest poll votes.<br />I believe that Eric Adams is expecting to lose the<br />mayoral election, but is staying in the running to<br />appease his own ego.","Sarah Kate Maher (40%): Eric Adams definitely<br />won't win, and his approval rating is abysmal.<br />However, he's stated that he will stay in the<br />race, and I think his hate of both candidates will<br />also be enough to keep him in the race. He also<br />has a demonstrated commitment to the people of New<br />York City, and I think he believes that dropping<br />out would be abandoning that commitment. He also<br />has campaign events planned for the future, and<br />since he's already invested so much in running,<br />I don't think he will drop out. However, there is<br />still a chance that he will drop out because o","Sasha Mahtani (35%): I gave a relatively low<br />probability that Eric Adams will drop out of<br />the New York City mayoral race as he heavily<br />paints himself as a man for the people, and going<br />against his word where he has stated he will not<br />be dropping out might be too much of a hit to his<br />reputation. Even if the \"smart\" decision would<br />be to drop out as he has little to no chance of<br />winning, his incentive to keep running is to keep<br />Mamdani from winning. There is a chance he will<br />drop out much closer to the election date but his<br />name remains on the ballot, and if he intends on<br />keeping his word then it is more than likely he<br />stays in the race.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (80%): As Zohran Mamdani has<br />received not only city-wide but global interest<br />during this mayoral race, sitting mayor Eric Adams<br />has fallen to obscurity, not even in the top 3.<br />President Trump has been speculated to offer Adams<br />a position in the U.S. government to prevent a<br />Mamdani win as much as possible, and Adams has<br />expressed uncertainty regarding remaining in<br />this race according to insider sources. Despite<br />campaign denial, likely an effort to save face as<br />long as possible anyway, Eric Adams has no reason<br />to stay in this race.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (65%): yes, I was a<br />discussion leader for this question. I looked at<br />his electoral viability and perceived viability<br />of several aspects of his campaign and ultimately<br />decided that he would drop out of the race mostly<br />due to the spoiler effect. He has entertained<br />taking other roles within the trump administration<br />and leaked that he would be open to another job.<br />He is polling poorly right now, so I think that<br />he would drop out because his presence in the<br />race takes away from Cuomo votes. Although he does<br />not support Cuomo, I think he fears a Mamdani win<br />more.","Zafar Ali (80%): Eric Adams is at a big<br />disadvantage when it comes to the NY Mayoral<br />race. Polls have shown Adams being least favorable<br />at as low as 8% as compared to Mamdani who sits<br />around 46%. Adams has stressed how committed<br />he is to the city which may indicate he won’t<br />drop out. However, his main goal is for Mamdani<br />not to win and he even said that as much as<br />he dislikes Cuomo, he would rather him win if<br />Mamdani doesn’t. It also seems more likely that<br />he drops out because there is closer to 48% and<br />46% when it is a two way between Mamdani and<br />Cuomo. Adams was offered a potential deal by the<br />Trump administration as well if he drops out. His<br />polling status since he announced his campaign<br />for reelection sat around 20% and has declined<br />to where it is now around 12%. Based on this<br />information, it is seems very unlikely to see<br />Adams go to the end.","Caroline Mattox (40%): I think there is a 40%<br />chance that Adams drops out of the race. I have<br />given a lower percentage because I think that if<br />he does it will be very last minute. I think he is<br />receiving some pressure from people on the outside<br />to drop out. However, I think as of right now he<br />has intentions to stick this race out."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,1)","legendgroup":"(Student,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.90000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.80000000000000004,0.84999999999999998,0.87,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.84999999999999998,0.84999999999999998,0.87,0.84999999999999998,0.85999999999999999,0.89000000000000001,0.85999999999999999,0.90000000000000002,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.69999999999999996,0.69999999999999996,0.78000000000000003,0.90000000000000002,0.87,0.84999999999999998,0.92000000000000004,0.93000000000000005,0.65000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.69999999999999996,0.84999999999999998,0.79000000000000004,0.91000000000000003,0.84999999999999998],"y":[1.9722631319426001,1.9595874234801158,2.0326714650727808,2.0091114509617909,2.0190082019194961,1.9642427839338779,2.0339346940396354,1.9865928397281096,2.0310477682622148,1.9662493026815355,1.9761323587270454,1.9546068254392595,1.9608435134869069,2.0044100378639995,1.9643545591505245,2.0105984088499098,1.9849315917585044,2.0292573200073094,1.9863022852689027,2.0447098423726855,2.0060894680209458,2.0112821873044595,2.0334666925016789,1.9685757029568776,2.0031349421245976,1.9651193763595074,1.9748041275888681,1.9607448428636416,2.0367702212184668,2.0108242595102639,1.9625671430723741,2.0168898138683291,1.9798149555921554,1.9681627740152181,2.0419213545275854,1.9959079953376204,2.0110214577289298],"text":["Akshara Singh (90%): Not only has the overall<br />number of applicants and EA applicants increased<br />each year, but with the university building<br />more dorms and dining halls, there's an obvious<br />inclination that UGA is prepping for more<br />applicants and therefore more admitted students<br />as well. We're also building a new school of<br />medicine and school or nursing, which could be an<br />added incentive to apply, especially in comparison<br />to more expensive or even private schools within<br />the state such as Tech and Emory. Furthermore,<br />especially for in-state students, the university<br />is a financially viable option and accepts more<br />in-state students than out-of-state (80 to 20<br />ratio) due to being a flagship university. There's<br />also the perception that EA applicants are more<br />likely to admitted than regular decision, and<br />applying early gives you the option to apply<br />again during regular decision in the case you're<br />deferred. All these reasons make me believe that<br />it's highly likely we'll have a record-breaking<br />number of EA applicants.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (85%): I think UGA will have a<br />record-breaking amount of early action applicants<br />because more people are choosing to go to college,<br />and UGA has been getting so much more attention<br />in recent years. A lot of students see how strong<br />the academics are here, but they also notice the<br />amazing campus life, sports, and opportunities<br />that set UGA apart. As a first-year student, I’ve<br />already seen how much pride people have in being<br />here, and I think that energy makes high school<br />students want to be a part of it too. Between<br />the growing reputation of the university and the<br />overall increase in students applying to college,<br />it makes sense that UGA is going to get more<br />applications than ever before.","Alizah Mudaliar (80%): I believe there is an<br />80% chance of a record-breaking number of EA<br />applications. More people are applying from out<br />of state and to public schools in general. There<br />is also a strong perception that applying early<br />gives one a higher chance of being accepted to the<br />school. Additionally, the admissions office has<br />hired more people to review applications and are<br />providing more tours to prospective students on<br />average. More dorms and dining halls being built<br />on campus shows the efforts to accommodate more<br />students. Hope and Zell Miller scholarships also<br />incentivize students to go to a public school<br />in-state, which keeps application numbers high.","Amanda Neighbour (85%): I believe it is almost<br />certain UGA will receive a record number of early<br />applications. Each year, admissions will take<br />a percentage higher, being almost 25% at times.<br />Applications increased dramatically after the two<br />National Championships and continue to creep up<br />exponentially since. Especially as we won the SEC<br />Championship last year, that can definitely cause<br />an uptick in applications. Early action is also<br />often encouraged, and some believe it gives them a<br />better chance, as UGA is becoming a harder school<br />to get into.","Ana Valencia (87%): Taking the median prediction<br />of the probabilities that UGA will exceed its<br />current record for EA applications, I estimate<br />that UGA will have a 87% of breaking this<br />record. Historically, UGA’s EA applications have<br />increased nearly every cycle since 2014, climbing<br />from 11,000 to over 30,000 in 2024-25. Even in<br />weaker years with low application growth, growth<br />persisted at 2–3% with more recent cycles having<br />double-digit gains. In-state applications also<br />keep rising by 13% in the last cycle with 13,000<br />Georgia students applying EA and having higher<br />admit rates than other students which is the most<br />advertised advantage of EA. The class of 2025 had<br />127,690 to 137,000 high school seniors in GA from<br />both public and private schools, so it is possible<br />that the number of seniors currently is similar<br />or a little bit lower. Based on democratic trends,<br />the growth rate of our state is supposed to grow<br />by 1 to 1.3% which could increase enrollment<br />rates and provide benefits for higher education<br />retention. The publicity from the SEC football<br />games may also affect the exposure that UGA has<br />across the country and the world which may also<br />lead to an increase in EA applications.","Anna Barton-Caucci (90%): I think there is<br />a 90% chance that we will see an increase in<br />EA applications to UGA this year because the<br />number of UGA applications has been drastically<br />increasing every year for over a decade with only<br />one exception. In general more people in the US<br />are also applying to colleges EA more. We also<br />tend to have more EA apps when we are having a<br />strong football season and I believe this will be<br />a strong football season for UGA. There is also a<br />30% increase in students wanting to go to public<br />colleges.","Anna Kneser (90%): UGA breaks the record of Early<br />Applicants every year, so it is very likely that<br />this trend will continue. The only time this trend<br />did not continue was in 2019, but that could be<br />because of factors outside of UGA itself, such<br />as a small graduating class. The UGA Admissions<br />also plans to visit high schools more often, which<br />will increase the number of applicants, and likely<br />early applicants. However, I am not 100% confident<br />because of the 2019 class, but I am still very<br />confident.","Blake Martin (90%): I predict that there will<br />be a 90 percent chance that there will be a<br />record-breaking number of EA applications to UGA<br />this fall. Every year, the amount of applicants<br />that apply early application increases. On<br />top of this, applicants applying to public<br />institutions, specifically in the Common App,<br />also have increased over time. UGA has gradually<br />become a very popular institution to apply to.<br />Due to us being in the SEC, success in football,<br />and countless amounts of opportunities, a lot of<br />students apply to UGA, especially out of state<br />students. Even with the possibility of students<br />not applying early action to UGA, because of<br />things like tuition, the increase of early<br />applications is too much to not say that there<br />will be a new record of applicants this year.","Breanne Talley (80%): There has been an increase<br />since roughly 2016, with a slight decrease in 2020<br />due to Covid-19. College students today will apply<br />to several colleges to give themselves options.<br />With UGA being a very popular country over<br />multiple different platforms, I think applications<br />will continue to increase.","Caleb Lux (85%): From an outside view, there<br />has been a consistent trend of increasing EA<br />applications for the past decade, and this is<br />paired with increasing in-state high school<br />graduating class sizes. Moreover, the increased<br />competition in admissions can drive more<br />students to apply EA. The median forecast from<br />the briefings is 85%, and I find this to be a<br />reasonable risk.","Caroline Mattox (85%): I think there is an 85%<br />chance that we will see a record-breaking number<br />of EA application to UGA this fall. As stated<br />in several briefings, we have seen the number of<br />EA applications steadily rising. My sister is a<br />senior this year and I have seen first hand how<br />many of her friends are applying EA. UGA's is only<br />becoming more and more popular so I think we will<br />see more EA applications this year.","Chris Haswell (87%): All evidence seems to suggest<br />that UGA's number of early applicants increases<br />every year. They've hired more admission workers,<br />are building a new dormatory and dining hall, and<br />have seen successive growth since 2016. The only<br />reason I'm not more confident is because there<br />is a chance that this is the year the number of<br />applicants plateaus. This could be because of<br />job market fears and Gen Z's understanding of the<br />viability of a college education in the age of AI.<br />But still, chances are it will be a few more years<br />until a high ranked public school feels these<br />effects, as it will primarily hit elite public<br />schools first.","Cierra Green (85%): Based on the previous trend<br />of EA applications to UGA, there has been a<br />consistent increase each year. This makes it<br />very likely the trend will continue for the next<br />round. Additionally, there have been multiple<br />projects across campus to build a new dining<br />hall, new freshman dorm, and a new parking deck.<br />The admissions office also indicated that they<br />have hired 2 more people and have been \"busy.\"<br />Although, this does not necessarily indicate<br />that this year will have a \"record breaking\"<br />amount of EA applications or if UGA just plans to<br />admit more/the same amount of students. The main<br />drawback is that the class of 2026 is expected<br />to be the first of a declining rate in graduate<br />numbers due to the decreased birth rates after the<br />recession. If there is a dip in applications, it<br />would be small, but would resolve this question to<br />\"no.\"","Elizabeth Nelson (86%): It is very likely that<br />UGA will break its Early Action application record<br />again this fall. Applications have risen almost<br />every year, with a sharp jump to 30,490 in 2025.<br />Because the Common App is a very easy application<br />process, HOPE has been expanded for scholarship<br />coverage, UGA's growing prestige, and the trend<br />of students applying to more public flagships, it<br />seems almost certain that UGA will continue its<br />trend of breaking EA application records. There<br />is one concern, which is that there is a slight<br />decline in Georgia seniors, which could play a<br />role into the amount of in state seniors that<br />apply EA to Georgia, but I think despite this,<br />there is still a very good chance.","Francesca Mariano (89%): UGA has consistently<br />experienced increasing EA applications every<br />cycle, seeing particularly large boosts in<br />2020 when UGA started using the common app and<br />2022 when we won the national championship.<br />Applying EA is particularly attractive because<br />it comes with fewer essays, no application fee,<br />and the possibility of having earlier access<br />to housing and orientation dates. Per one of<br />the brief writers, the admissions office has<br />reported being very busy and needing to hire<br />two additional workers, signaling they have even<br />more applications than usual. The SEC as a whole<br />has seen increasing EA applications, especially<br />applications from out-of-state. The median<br />probability among the briefs was 85, and the<br />extremized was 91.6. I believe there is an 89%<br />probability that UGA will have a record-breaking<br />number of EA applications.","Ellie Null (86%): I predict that there will 86%<br />of a record breaking number of early applications<br />this year. I think that there are a lot of social<br />factors like football and our reputation could<br />increase our popularity. And there has always been<br />a continuous increase for number of applications.<br />Especially when the test optional policy got<br />implemented. In 2019 we had a small dip in numbers<br />but only by 2%. The number of college applications<br />is rising so the pool is expected to get a lot<br />bigger and especially people from other states and<br />from the north. I think overall there is no reason<br />for UGA to not break its record again for number<br />of applicants since it is pretty much a continuous<br />trend. The university of Georgia has become a top<br />school as it is ranked 18th in the nation.","Hunter Murray (90%): I think an important part of<br />forecasting is fully understanding what is being<br />forecasted. Everyone in our class is familiar<br />with the University of Georgia’s admission<br />system, but it is helpful to clarify that UGA’s<br />non-binding Early Action application route is<br />an increasingly unique avenue in the context of<br />national college applications. EA tends to capture<br />high-performing in-state students also applying<br />to other schools, and it also acts as a risk-free<br />way for any student to increase the admission<br />chances. The only “catch” is that the application<br />is usually due in mid-October (which is usually<br />not too big of a deal for high performing students<br />planning on applying to multiple schools).<br />Additionally, UGA’s prestige as a university has<br />risen significantly in recent years. Academics<br />rankings for the university as a whole, as well<br />as specific colleges (especially Terry College of<br />Business and the Veterinary School), have climbed.<br />U.S. News and World Report, USA Today, and the<br />Princeton Review have all demonstrated this<br />trend. This rising ranking has also accompanied<br />increased success for the UGA football team,<br />which further acts to increase application<br />numbers. Whether UGA’s academic prestige has<br />caused increased admission or vice versa is not<br />really a concern when trying to provide context<br />for this prediction; the two factors seem to<br />be interdependent and have led to a “snowball”<br />effect. This increase in applications over the<br />past 10 years has led to rising EA admission,<br />which acts as yet another motivating factor for<br />students to apply EA. Finally, the applicant pool<br />has continued to grow both at a national and, more<br />importantly, state level. This directly correlates<br />to increasing EA applications to UGA, as UGA is<br />the largest public institution in the state and<br />significant financial incentives for in-state<br />students to attend. Additionally, attracting<br />high numbers of in-state students is in line with<br />both the strategic goals of the University as<br />well as the funding requirements laid out by the<br />Georgia legislature. Based on all of this data<br />and supporting evidence, I believe that it is<br />almost certain that UGA EA application numbers<br />will increase this year. I put this percentage<br />at 90%. There have not been any major factors to<br />decrease UGA’s popularity, and almost all signs<br />point to more applications. I do believe that the<br />number of admissions could see a drop, and that<br />the admission rate will almost certainly drop.<br />This is in line with the strategic plans of the<br />University, as outlined in the UGA Strategic Plan<br />and recent construction on campus (based on the<br />Flagpole articles as well as conversations I had<br />with a couple administrators).","Jack Lutz (75%): High school class sizes have<br />not yet plateaued, and the University continues<br />to garner attention for academics and athletics.<br />Additionally, with out-of-state interest on the<br />rise, early application becomes more appealing<br />since it allows for an early answer that can make<br />other college decisions earlier.","Jackson Bost (85%): The combination of a larger<br />graduate pool (at least for GA high schools),<br />increasing competition among out of state<br />students, an occupied admissions office, and<br />continued construction on campus all point towards<br />an anticipated record number of EA applicants.<br />While growth might regress some, especially given<br />the recent trend of big jumps preceding smaller<br />ones, there does not seem to have been enough<br />negative press or off-putting changes to the<br />application to scare away applicants, and although<br />it may be nearing, I do not believe we are quite<br />at that population drop off yet.","James Hunter Darke (90%): Yes. Each year the<br />number of applicants has grown, and nothing points<br />towards that trend stopping. UGA has not lost any<br />popularity, and I believe more students will try<br />to come here. Some students may hesitate to apply<br />because it has become harder to get into, but<br />each year the admission criteria has risen, and<br />continuously more students apply.","Jhaycee Barnes (90%): All the signs point toward<br />UGA breaking its Early Action record again.<br />Nationally, applications are rising fast at big<br />public schools, and Southern flagships like UGA<br />are seeing a lot of interest in out of state<br />students. The numbers for UGA students have<br />climbed almost every year for a decade, and<br />factors like football, campus culture, and the<br />short application keep demand high. The only<br />reason it’s not 100% is that selectivity could<br />slow things down a little, but the momentum is<br />still super strong.","Kristoffer Fields (70%): As someone who has seen<br />UGA grow over the years it seems like every year<br />the number keeps getting larger and larger as well<br />as a lot of funding for expanding infrastructure,<br />housing, dining hall, also a school notorious for<br />parking issues in my opinion all of these factors<br />point in the direction of yes.","Liz Yancey (70%): I think, given that there<br />has been an increase since the 2023 applicant<br />pool, it's highly likely that there will be<br />a record-breaking amount of early applicants<br />again, even if it's just a small increase from<br />last cycle. The extension of Hope can encourage<br />students to apply. UGA has the reputation of being<br />a powerhouse in both athletics and academics,<br />which potential students are aware of. This could<br />push more kids to apply as well.","Manuv Datta (78%): Yes, there will be a<br />record-breaking number of EA applicants this<br />fall. I make this prediction based on the external<br />factor of EA applications rising each year since<br />COVID began, as UGA listed directly on the common<br />application for the option to apply early. Also,<br />I believe that the rise of AI and softwares such<br />as ChatGPT, will result in more students tailoring<br />their applications with far greater speed than<br />before.","Mateo Ceron (90%): I formulated this week's<br />question based on the briefings from my<br />classmates. The general consensus from the<br />briefings is that there is a very good chance that<br />there is a record-breaking number of applications<br />this fall. According to some of the graphs that<br />classmates made, there are rising numbers of high<br />school graduates in Georgia, and EA applications<br />have been on a steady rise over the past years<br />since 2016. There is also the SEC school/ natty<br />champs pull that UGA has going for it that is<br />enticing people to apply. That's why I believe<br />that this prediction has an 90% chance of coming<br />true.","Nic Curtis (87%): Each year for the better part<br />of a decade the number of EA applicants to UGA<br />has increased. One of the briefings mentioned<br />that public universities overall have seen a 13%<br />increase in EA applications. I see very little<br />reason for this trend to slow down or regress<br />toward the mean this year. I think the fact that<br />EA applications have continued to rise, paired<br />with the increasing appeal southern schools have<br />to out of state applicants due to football and<br />greek life, especially UGA, nearly guarantees that<br />UGA will see another record-breaking year of EA<br />applicants.","Owen Johnston (85%): Due to the fact that UGA has<br />opened new schools, built new dorms and dining<br />halls, emphasized early action in admissions<br />materials, a great football program, and an<br />increase in applications to public schools overall<br />all of this information suggests that UGA will<br />accept a record number of early action applicants<br />this Fall.","Paul Frilingos (92%): For this probability, I am<br />going to try extremizing the probabilities found<br />in the briefings. If I use an alpha level of 2.5<br />that is used for superforecasters, I would get<br />98%. However, I don't think we are quite on that<br />level yet. I do think there seems to be some<br />independent information here, so I instead used<br />an alpha level of 1.5, giving me a 92% likelihood<br />from extremizing the other predictions.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (93%): I would<br />forecast with 93% certainty that UGA will break<br />its record for Early Action applications this<br />fall. Applications have risen almost every year.<br />The national trends show strong growth at Southern<br />flagships due to affordability, athletics, and<br />rising prestige. GA continues to expand its<br />recruitment outreach and host record numbers<br />of campus tours. UGA’s scholarships incentivize<br />Georgia students to apply early. Even though<br />demographics and selectivity could slow growth, I<br />think overall the record is very likely.","Reese Fabritius (65%): I think that because of<br />football and the overall trend of admissions,<br />there is no reason for admissions to slow down.<br />We will continue to increase as we have in the<br />past because of UGAs acedemic performance and out<br />of state credibility. Students from not just the<br />south want to go to UGA","Ruhi Doddamani (80%): The volatility of<br />application season sees GT and UGA as the biggest<br />funnel of in-state students, excluding Emory<br />because, as a private institution, Hope and<br />Zelle don't cover tuition. UGA is building more<br />dorms (no parking, though) just to deal with the<br />overflow of students into the greater ACC area,<br />and the admissions office is even hiring more<br />people to deal with the surplus of applications.<br />There's also the Nationals bump that brings more<br />people from the North, the Greek life appeals<br />that brings another, yet similar demograph down<br />as well. There's the prospective 2025 peak, but<br />weighing all factors, I'm choosing yes.","Ryan Marx (90%): I believe there to be around<br />a 90% probability that UGA will see an record<br />breaking number of EA applications this fall.<br />First of all, the level of Prestige that the<br />university holds has risen exponentially with<br />specific colleges such as the Terry School of<br />Business as well as the Success of the College<br />football team has made the University very<br />desirable to students both in and out of state.<br />Furthermore, because EA's act as a risk free<br />option for students to increase their admissions<br />chances leading for high performing students to<br />make more submissions than usual. All of these<br />factors lead me to believe that there is a 90%<br />chance for more EA applications this fall.","Sade Ezekiel (70%): I think UGA will experience<br />a record-breaking number of EA applications this<br />year. The University of Georgia has seen a rise<br />in early applications each year. With more and<br />more people wanting to be at a successful SEC<br />school for their freshman year, the upward trend<br />of applications never stops. There is a recurring<br />rumor that says if one were to apply early/they<br />will have a greater chance at getting accepted<br />into the school. While this rumor is very untrue,<br />many believe that this is the key to getting<br />accepted to the university. From looking at the<br />number of early applications to UGA from my high<br />school, I believe that this year, UGA will beat<br />last year's record of EA applications.","Sarah Kate Maher (85%): Every year, the record is<br />broken for EA applications to UGA. I don't see a<br />reason why this trend would stop or even slow at<br />all. There is also a trend of early applications<br />to colleges overall, and I don't think this trend<br />will stop either. If anything, the rate at which<br />UGA EA applications are rising may slow, but<br />the record will still be broken. UGA admissions<br />has more high school visits than ever planned<br />for this admissions cycle, which in the past has<br />possibly been correlated to the increase in EA<br />applications.","Sasha Mahtani (79%): Based on our discussions<br />in class, I believe it is more than likely there<br />will be a record-breaking number of EA applicants<br />this year for UGA. UGA's EA growth has increased,<br />continously breaking its own record with in and<br />out of state students. UGA's ranking for the<br />best public university has gone up one place from<br />number 19 to 18 proving that UGA has increasing<br />appeal nationwide. SEC schools are becoming more<br />and more popular over the years, especially with<br />students up in the northeast, and UGA continues to<br />be a highly desirable choice. I also mentioned in<br />my briefing that we have three highly anticipated<br />football games versus competitive rivals before<br />early action applications close. This includes<br />Kentucky, Alabama, and Auburn. These games all<br />occuring right before applications close can<br />influence a larger surge closer to the deadline of<br />out of state applicants who are enticed by UGA's<br />football scene. If we perform well in these games,<br />I think we will continue to break the record of<br />early action applicants.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (91%): The simplest yet most<br />important way to assess a question like this<br />is to look at the data, and the data is clear.<br />Year after year, UGA has been breaking its own<br />record of EA applicants, this past year having<br />a staggering 30,000. Although some of the<br />reasons given regarding why EA applications keep<br />rising have dwindled a bit, namely our national<br />championships, one should nevertheless expect EA<br />applications to yet again reach a record high,<br />consistent with its trend of growth since 2014,<br />long before we were taking home the Natty.","Zafar Ali (85%): The main reasons I find this<br />very likely to happen is because there seems to<br />be a large amount of students that come to UGA<br />each year. Perspectives of people who work as tour<br />guides as well as in orientation have also helped<br />with this prediction, supporting the idea that<br />each year, more and more students are interested<br />in coming to UGA. Many tend to be from the North<br />East, which also adds to the current population<br />of Georgia as well as other neighboring states<br />in the South. UGA is also the flagship university<br />of Georgia as well as being a public institution<br />which will likely garner more attention from<br />possible applicants. Infrastructure for freshman<br />dorms as well as dining halls have been a key<br />focus for the school, which seems like they are<br />preparing for a larger number of incoming freshmen<br />as EA applicants. Lastly, UGA is big when it comes<br />to college football and the SEC culture, so this<br />is something that also may draw the attention of<br />many students."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.57999999999999996],"y":[0.97940994186792518],"text":"Crowd (58%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,1)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.84999999999999998],"y":[1.9716093888739123],"text":"Crowd (85%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.55000000000000004],"y":[0.99957341374829412],"text":"Joe Ornstein (55%): Fresh off an embarrassing<br />forecast result where I disregarded the prediction<br />markets, it's hard to ignore the fact that the<br />gamblers are currently giving him about 2:1 odds<br />to drop out.

The record shows that EA<br />applications have tripled since 2013, and 3/4<br />of that growth is attributable to out-of-state<br />applicants. As best I can tell, this reflects a<br />broad trend towards students applying widely, and<br />there's no particular reason to believe that it<br />will slow down this year.

Furthermore, she broke the<br />record for most amount of pre-saves for her new<br />album within 24 hours. Her recent engagement<br />provides her with good PR and gives her more<br />attention in the spotlight. Also with the Eras<br />Tour just ending last year, listeners are probably<br />itching for her next songs, so the anticipation<br />from them could make it so she breaks her previous<br />record with this new release. Taylor also has a<br />wide variety of listeners, ranging from pre-teens<br />all the way to the Baby Boomer generation, making<br />her fan-base extensive. And if Spotify users<br />in general are increasing, then the number of<br />people contributing to this record will naturally<br />increase as well. All of these reasons, on top of<br />her previous stats, lead me to believe that it's<br />highly likely for her to break her record.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (85%): Taylor Swift being<br />the large popular musci icon she is has shown<br />her impact in music sales and streaming through<br />various different eras of her music career.<br />Online fandoms are really deteermined to get their<br />favorite artists on charts as well as help them<br />break records they set. Taylor Swift's fandom<br />on social media has been extremely vocal about<br />helping the artist beat her record of streams<br />by setting up listening and streaming session<br />with fans worldwide. Taylor Swift has also set<br />impressive records with her past albums reaching<br />hundreds of millions of streams. Taylor Swift is<br />also one of the most streamed artists on Spotify<br />making the record breaking mark a seemingly<br />achieveable mark.","Alizah Mudaliar (81%): Taylor Swift will likely<br />break her own record of 25,204,472 streams in a<br />single day. Currently she holds 10 songs in top<br />15 streamed songs on Spotify. Her popularity is<br />continuously increasing following the Eras Tour<br />and her new album The Tortured Poets Department.<br />She broke the record for the most pre-saved album,<br />and she also held the previous record. There are<br />now 80 million more Spotify users today, making it<br />more likely she will break the record. Her media<br />presence and growing attention has increased her<br />audience. Additionally, she is switching to an<br />older producer, Max Martin, who has produced her<br />more pop music, which may be more popular than her<br />previous albums.","Amanda Neighbour (90%): What is most convincing<br />here is that the album has broken the spotify<br />record as the most pre-saved album in history.<br />Taylor Swift was the most streamed artist on<br />spotify last year and its growing amount of users<br />further contributes to her potential streams.<br />Fortnight from her last album broke the record<br />for the most streams on the first day. Her past<br />two albums have broken spotify records and this<br />trend is likely to continue. Especially with the<br />influx of media and PR surrounding her wedding,<br />she is expected to yield many streams. Her fan<br />base consists of all ages and the producers is<br />known for top pop singles. All these factors<br />coming together demonstrates a high chance of her<br />breaking another record.","Ana Valencia (90%): On Spotify, the album has<br />broken the record as the most pre-saved album<br />countdown page on the platform. This already adds<br />to her record of being Spotify’s biggest-streamed<br />artist for 2024 with 26.6 billion streams.<br />Combined with the fact that the album's lead<br />single MV will drop on the same day as the rest of<br />the album means there would be a more accumulated<br />amount of streams for both simultanously. Combined<br />with media attention due to her recent engagement<br />and a push from Spotify's homepage algorithm,<br />her 12 track album can deliver S ≈ 315–330M album<br />streams day one and a lead share T ≈ 9.3–9.8%,<br />implying S×T ≈ 29–32M, I predict her single will<br />do well above 25.204 million.","Anna Barton-Caucci (75%): I think there is a 75%<br />chance that Taylor Swift will break her own single<br />day Spotify record record with a song from Life of<br />a Showgirl because she pretty consistently breaks<br />her own streaming record when she releases new<br />albums. Since her album Midnights was released she<br />has also gained 150 million new listeners which<br />increases the chance of her breaking her record<br />again.","Anna Kneser (75%): Taylor's streaming power is<br />very strong, and she has often broken her own<br />records before. Her song, \"Fortnight\" is currently<br />the most-streamed song in a single day on Spotify.<br />so who's to say that another one of her songs will<br />be the most streamed. Currently, TTPD is the most<br />pre-saved album in Spotify history, which leads<br />me to predict that there will be more listeners.<br />Also, she recently announced her engagement to<br />Travis Kelce, which may expand her audience to<br />other people, and not just \"swifties.\" Also, she<br />is doing a collab with Sabrina Carpenter, and<br />these are the top two women artists at the moment.<br />Both of the fan bases will listen to this song<br />and likely exceed the song, Fortnite, which was a<br />collab with Post Malone. There are also 35 million<br />more Spotify users than when she last broke the<br />record. I am fairly confident that Taylor Swift's<br />new album will break her own single-day Spotify<br />streaming record, but still 25% hesitant because<br />it would take a lot to break the record such when<br />thinking of factors like \"streaming fatigue\".","Arshia Charkhian (75%): With the increased<br />attention on Taylor Swift due to her relationship<br />with Travis Kelce during the football season<br />and the release of an album that is more<br />pop-influenced than its predecessor, featuring<br />a song that already has the most streams, I give<br />it a 75 percent chance that she breaks her own<br />streaming record.","Breanne Talley (75%): I think it is highly likely<br />that it will happen, as she is one of the top<br />artists in the world. She is also making this<br />album with one of her old producers who wrote<br />some of her most popular songs. Taylor is also<br />getting a lot of social media attention from her<br />engagement, the fact that it is football season,<br />and that she is dating a very well-known NFL<br />football player. Her past two albums have done<br />extremely well, and she is marketing this album<br />more than the last one. She has also already<br />broken the record for most pre-saves on Spotify,<br />as well as most pre-orders for merchandise.","Caleb Lux (76%): It will take a lot to beat<br />Swift's single-day streaming record, but Life of<br />a Showgirl may be the force to do it. Taking an<br />average of all the briefing's probabilities, I get<br />76%, and I find this to be a reasonably cautious<br />estimate. It is likely but nowhere near certain.","Caroline Mattox (85%): I believe there is an 85%<br />chance that Taylor Swift will break this record.<br />This album has already broken records for the most<br />pre-saved album and that record was previously<br />help by her previous album, The Tortured Poets<br />Department. She has also already broken this<br />record before.","Chris Haswell (81%): I think it is very likely<br />that Taylor Swift breaks her record given the<br />immense media attention surrounding her right now.<br />The album has already broken the presave record<br />for Spotify, signaling excitement about her newest<br />release. Furthermore, her collab with Sabrina<br />Carpenter will be exciting for fans of both<br />artists, making it a strong contender to break<br />the record. While I am slightly worried about<br />regression to the mean, I do believe that Taylor<br />Swift is at the height of her popularity, and I am<br />encouraged by her return to the generic pop-style<br />that people know and love her for.","Cierra Green (80%): With TLOAS breaking records<br />for the most presaved album on Spotify, this<br />makes it more likely that TLOAS will have more<br />single-day streams than Fortnite. She has also<br />had more media coverage with her recent engagement<br />and podcast appearances. Additionally, one of<br />her tracks features Sabrina Carpenter, who is<br />currently very popular and will bring attention to<br />their collaboration. If we compare Sabrina to Post<br />Malone, the featured artist on Fortnite, Sabrina<br />has 74,300,099 monthly listeners on Spotify and<br />48.9 million followers on Instagram whereas Post<br />Malone has 66,861,596 monthly listeners and 26.9<br />million followers. Meaning, Sabrina is likely to<br />bring more listeners than Post Malone did. Also,<br />the amount of Spotify accounts has increased by<br />about 30 million since the release of Fortnite,<br />which can increase the baseline amount of streams<br />for TLOAS.","Elizabeth Nelson (74%): I believe there is a<br />74% chance that Taylor Swift will break her own<br />single-day Spotify streaming record given the<br />increased amount of Spotify users since her last<br />record, and since this album so far has a new<br />record of pre-sales. She is also not releasing<br />the cover title song early, so this increases the<br />chances of people listening to the album on the<br />release day. Obviously, there could be a lower<br />chance if competing artists drop music around the<br />same time, but Taylor is pretty methodical when it<br />comes to planning her music.","Francesca Mariano (84%): Taylor Swift's current<br />single-day streaming record for a song is from<br />her previous album, which had a Post Malone<br />feature. Her upcoming album has one feature with<br />Sabrina Carpenter, another extremely famous and<br />\"now\" artist with extremely popular singles.<br />This record was in the 30 million, an already<br />extremely high number, posing a threat that her<br />next album may have songs that do not quite reach<br />this number if accounting for regression to the<br />mean. Swift regularly receives national attention,<br />but this attention has been especially heightened<br />because of her record-breaking Eras tour and her<br />recent engagement to football star Travis Kelce,<br />possibly causing more people to have eyes on her<br />upcoming album release. Spotify has also seen an<br />approximate 80 million increase in monthly active<br />listeners since 2024, when Taylor Swift originally<br />broke the record. An increase in listeners may<br />increase the chances that Swift's record will be<br />broken with her new songs. Swift is also using<br />a producer who has made some of modern pop's<br />biggest hits. Given all of this and the average<br />probability of the briefs being 76, I place my<br />probability at 84%.","Ellie Null (75%): I predict that there is a 75<br />percent chance that Taylor Swift will break her<br />own single-day Spotify streaming record with a<br />song from \"The Life of a Showgirl\". It's only 12<br />songs long which will help with the streams and<br />people might replay them all more. The streams<br />won't be as divided as they would be with the<br />tortured poets department. Furthermore, this will<br />lead to her having a hit single. Taylor swift has<br />become even more popular over the years and has<br />grown her following. This question is all about<br />her own single day record so I assume that she<br />will grow in streams. She also recently won a<br />grammy and got engaged. She is in the public eye<br />a lot!! The social media and music platforms like<br />Spotify will push her music. They have grown in<br />viewership and membership immensely since her last<br />album. I will be listening all day!","Hunter Murray (80%): Once again, this is a field<br />which I am wholly uneducated in. I’ll start with<br />what I know: I know there are more Spotify users<br />than ever, I know Spotify pushes “sponsored” music<br />like Taylor Swift more than ever to users, I know<br />that Taylor Swift is very popular globally as<br />evidenced by her huge tour, and I know that there<br />seems to be a ton of media attention on her new<br />album already. I think all of this information,<br />combined with the research and insights from<br />all of the briefings, lead me to feel extremely<br />confident that she will indeed break the record.","Jack Lutz (82%): For the first time in years,<br />Taylor Swift has actually made an effort to<br />promote a new album, on social media, her<br />fiancé's podcast, and even on streaming platforms<br />themselves. With her newest album having many<br />fewer songs and a feature from current top<br />artist Sabrina Carpenter, having more streams<br />across fewer songs bodes well for my prediction.<br />Additionally, with the Eras tour over, no other<br />artist competition, and the announcement of her<br />engagement, Taylor has once again captured the<br />public's attention, and I believe she will break<br />the record again.","Jackson Bost (84%): Swift and her music should<br />continue to ride high off of lingering success<br />from the Eras Tour. When that is combined with<br />the amount of promotion surrounding the release of<br />The Life Of A Showgirl, which includes in-person<br />events with plenty of opportunities to continually<br />stream a song, and her strong track record of<br />producing hits, Swift should expect to enjoy<br />another record soon. While there can be concern<br />for regression to the mean, the triumphant return<br />of Max Martin, who has a strong track record<br />himself, should provide enough new incentive for<br />listeners to stream a song over and over again.","James Hunter Darke (90%): I am 90% confident<br />that Taylor Swifts new album will set a spotify<br />streaming record. She already has numerous<br />streaming records, and has absolutely dominated<br />the music industry over the last couple years. I<br />think her engagement to Travis Kelce only brings<br />more hype to the album, and the presaves are<br />already through the roof. I am extremely confident<br />she will break the record.","Jhaycee Barnes (75%): This album is the most<br />pre-saved album in Spotify history, and with<br />Spotify's algorithm, pre-saves are pushed now<br />more than ever. With only 12 songs, the streams<br />will likely be concentrated, increasing the odds<br />that one track will hit a record. However, 25<br />million streams is a high benchmark to hit. Even<br />the second most streamed song in a day is a few<br />million streams behind it. Also with a shorter<br />album, there aren't as many opportunities for<br />playlist placement with the Spotify algorithm,<br />and the lone guest spot from Sabrina Carpenter<br />(whose fan base overlaps with Swift’s) lacks the<br />cross‑genre reach that Post Malone brought to the<br />previous song.","Kira Fleischer (74%): One of the songs on the<br />album is a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter.<br />Sabrina Carpenter has grown an insane amount in<br />popularity recently, and so the song will bring<br />in both Swift and Carpenter fans. Also, she has<br />surpassed the record of pre-saved albums, which<br />was previously held by fortnite, indicating<br />increased support for this album. Other artists,<br />however, like Drake and Bad Bunny who have broken<br />their own record twice, have no to been able to<br />keep up the streak for a third in a row. The trend<br />could apply to Taylor Swift.","Kristoffer Fields (85%): Although she is not one<br />of my favorite artists given her popular trends<br />both musically and celebrity wise I do place the<br />probability of her breaking her own record high<br />as there is a lot of hype surrounding her at the<br />moment as well as having a lot of popular features<br />on her album. Furthermore, not many high level top<br />artists are releasing music at the moment. With<br />digital audio and music libraries like Spotify<br />so accessible nowadays I think that it is more<br />probable that it spreads rapidly and gets shared a<br />lot via streaming services.","Liz Yancey (83%): I originally put 75% probability<br />of Swift breaking her own record, but after<br />today's discussion, I would put mine at around<br />83%. I was honestly being modest with my original<br />prediction, and I wouldn't be surprised if she<br />beat this record unless the amount of streams<br />was insanely more than 25 million, hence why I<br />chose to up the probability of it happening. I<br />still stand by my reasoning laid out in my brief;<br />I just think I was too afraid to increase the<br />probability.","Manuv Datta (68%): Yes, Taylor Swift will break<br />her own single-day streaming record. I base this<br />forecast in various factors. Taylor's upcoming<br />album is the most pre-saved album on Spotify<br />ever. Also, Spotify has added well over 60 million<br />users since Taylor last broke the record. Taylor's<br />popularity and presence in the media has also<br />increased over the course of the past few weeks,<br />as her engagement to Travis Kelce was recent.<br />All of these help me predict there is a higher<br />likelihood Taylor will break her own record after<br />the release of her own album.","Owen Johnston (90%): It has been shown that<br />Swift’s prowess and presence as a force in the<br />media has remained constant with Swift being the<br />most streamed artist on Spotify in 2024 and her<br />album being the most pre-saved in history despite<br />little promotion, beating out her previous record<br />for TTPD. Because of these factors, I predict that<br />swift will break her own streaming record with<br />a song from The Life of a Showgirl. I will give<br />it a probability of 90%. The 10% not given is an<br />allowance for the small chance that Swift’s new<br />album cannot surpass TTPD due to the Eras Tour<br />being over.","Paul Frilingos (90%): I searched far and wide<br />for all possible reasons and explanations that<br />it couldn't happen, but they are simply far too<br />unlikely to stop the force that is Taylor Swift.<br />The fact that this album is much shorter than her<br />last two makes it a lot easier for her to break<br />the record with a single song, so I think it's<br />very likely.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (90%): I estimate<br />an 90% chance that Taylor Swift will break her own<br />single-day Spotify streaming record with a track<br />from The Life of a Showgirl. Swift has already<br />set this record twice in a row with Midnights<br />(“Anti-Hero”) and The Tortured Poets Department<br />(“Fortnight”). The new album has become the most<br />pre-saved in Spotify history. So this evidence<br />suggests that another record-breaking debut is<br />highly probable.","Reese Fabritius (85%): I am very confident that<br />she will break this record and continue on her<br />streak of highly sucessfull albums. It already<br />has the most presaves and she has broken this<br />record for her past two albums. Also, with her<br />engagement, she has only increased in popularity<br />and media attention, which will corelate with more<br />people listening to her music.","Ruhi Doddamani (75%): Taylor Swift, if she were to<br />break the record, would have to maintain the hype<br />similar to albums by artists achieving comparable<br />numbers. She's coasting on the engagement fanfare<br />as well. Sabrina's incoming collab, who's coming<br />off a full-length album as well. Presaves are<br />breaking records already. I do think it's super<br />likely, especially if she adds on extra songs<br />as she's been doing for her past couple of album<br />releases. No pre-release singles to screw the<br />numbers either.","Ryan Marx (60%): I believe there is approximately<br />a 60% chance that Taylor Swift will break her own<br />single-day Spotify record with a song from \"the<br />life of a showgirl\". My first bit of reasoning<br />is that Taylor Swift has already set countless<br />records on spotify. Her Album \"Tortured poets<br />Department\" became the first album in spotify's<br />history to garner over 300 million streams in a<br />single day and became the most streamed album in<br />a single day in 2024 in just under 12 hours thanks<br />to her dedicated fans known as \"swifties\".My<br />other piece of reasoning is that Swift employs<br />masterful use of strategic marketing and promotion<br />to increase the hype around her upcoming release<br />through cryptic messages on social media and sells<br />exclusively timed merchanidse to maintain momentum<br />with the more attention drawn to the project, the<br />more attention the media places upon the album,<br />and the more likely people will be to stream it<br />when it releases. This is why I believe there is<br />a 60% chance of Taylor swift breaking her spotify<br />record.","Sade Ezekiel (83%): Taylor Swift is a<br />world-renowned Grammy-winning pop artist.<br />Taylor Swift's Midnights And The Tortured Poets<br />Department both broke her single-day streaming<br />record on Spotify. These albums were about<br />revenge, break-ups, and falling in love. Many<br />of her fans believe that this album will be<br />happier and upbeat due to her recent engagement<br />with Travis Kelce and her many successful public<br />interviews. Also, there has been continuous drama<br />between her \"closest friend,\" Blake Lively, and<br />Jason Baldoni over a sexual harassment case. Many<br />\"Swifties\" believe that there could be a mention<br />of the drama in her new album. This gives fans<br />another motive to stream her newest album. I think<br />that due to the successes and public face Taylor<br />Swift has had in the past couple of months to a<br />year, many people will want to stream this album.<br />I believe there is an 83% chance that Taylor Swift<br />will break her own single-day Spotify streaming<br />record with a song from \"The Life of a Showgirl\",<br />and there is only a 17% chance that she will not<br />beat her own streaming record.","Sarah Kate Maher (74%): The Life of a Showgirl<br />is already the most pre-saved album in Spotify<br />history, which almost speaks for itself. Taylor<br />Swift was also the most streamed artist in 2024.<br />This trend is set to continue unless something<br />stops it, and looking forward I'm not sure that<br />it's going to be stopped. I also think the buzz<br />around her engagement will cause more people to<br />tune in to the album that possibly wouldn't have<br />before. Also, the song with Sabrina Carpenter also<br />might get a lot of streams from Sabrina Carpenter<br />fans who otherwise wouldn't tune in.","Sasha Mahtani (77%): It is more than likely that<br />Taylor will break her own single-day Spotify<br />streaming record. \"Fortnight\" by Taylor Swift<br />featuring Post Malone holds the record, and I<br />believe her collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter<br />will leverage enough listeners to beat the<br />record. We discussed in class how the number of<br />Spotify users has only increased making it more<br />likely the record will be broken. The album has<br />12 songs, which will be released in theaters as<br />a listening-party movie experience. This movie<br />release may divert listeners from that initial<br />day of streaming if they only choose to watch<br />the movie, or may boost hype and awareness with<br />this multi-platform presence. Taylor recently<br />getting engaged to Travis Kelce means she is<br />under a hefty public eye, maybe more now than<br />ever which can possibly boost streams further up.<br />Considering it was a collaboration with a well<br />known artist (Post Malone) that allowed her to<br />set this record, and she has another collaboration<br />with Sabrina Carpenter in the album leads me to<br />feel confident that she will break the record of<br />single-day Spotify streams with a single song. I<br />believe Taylor is extremely ambitious, not only<br />as a songwriter but a businesswoman, and will<br />do anything to strive and break her own record,<br />setting new standards for pop stars until the end<br />of time...","Shaheer Ul-Islam (85%): The single-day Spotify<br />streaming record list makes it quite clear:<br />Taylor Swift is queen. Among the top fifteen<br />on said list, Taylor Swift appears six times,<br />including the first, third, and fifth places.<br />More importantly, all three of those songs are<br />on her most recent album that came out last year.<br />Given that Taylor Swift's success in this specific<br />category has only increased in the past few years,<br />with song number one Fortnight jumping six million<br />single-day streams above number two, I don't see<br />this record breaking stopping.","Zafar Ali (78%): I did the briefing for this<br />prediction and found it more likely to see her<br />breaking her record. She currently leads by<br />a large margin compared to previous streaming<br />records which does suggest the idea of regression<br />to the mean. However, I think she can still have<br />a better chance of breaking her record considering<br />that Sabrina Carpenter is a featured artist (both<br />having overlapping fanbases and good synergy),<br />as well as the Spotify Algorithm working in her<br />favor since it tends to recommend new releases<br />and similar sounding songs. So even if someone<br />does not listen to her, they will likely get<br />recommended one of her new songs based on their<br />music taste. She also has upwards of 87 million<br />monthly listeners as well as being the second most<br />followed artist on the platform. Considering that<br />she also has had her last two albums break this<br />record with at least one song, it helps to support<br />that she has a good chance of doing so. Album<br />length can be an issue with Showgirl only having<br />12 confirmed tracks, but that is not as much of<br />a concern for a single track as compared to the<br />whole album in terms of streaming. Lastly, Taylor<br />Swift is very engaged with her fans having been<br />able to mobilize her fanbase well in the past.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (87%): It’s highly likely<br />Taylor Swift will break her own streaming<br />records. Her consistent history of surpassing<br />past milestones suggests she’s poised to do it<br />again. With a broad, multi-generational fanbase<br />and a record number of pre-saves on her upcoming<br />album, anticipation is at an all-time high. Her<br />strong public image, recently bolstered by her<br />engagement, only adds to the momentum.

So even though there were a<br />decent amount of resignations, the amount of time<br />for it to occur was a lot longer. So to say there<br />will be any resignations or someone will be fired<br />in just the first year of his term, specifically<br />within the next two months seems unlikely. So<br />far any fallouts we've seen have been outside<br />his cabinet (Trump and Elon Musk) and the current<br />cabinet members are much more complacent and loyal<br />to the president in comparison to his first term<br />members as well. And despite all the scandals<br />(Epstein Files) and declining public opinion,<br />Trump has not been affected and continues to make<br />his decisions without considering the backlash.<br />Therefore, since Trump is known for breaking/going<br />against precedent and often fires those that go<br />against him, it is still somewhat possible that<br />he could blow up over something and fire someone.<br />But overall, I think it's not very likely for<br />a cabinet member specifically to be fired or<br />for someone to resign, especially in the next 2<br />months.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (40%): The possibility of a<br />cabinent member being removed or resigning from<br />Trumps Cabinet is truly a point of debate. I<br />believe that the possibility is on the lower end<br />of the spectrum but I would not entirely rule out<br />the possibility of such an event happening simply<br />because Donald Trump is an unpredictable figure<br />who acts depending on his own personal agenda.<br />I do believe that Trump's Cabinet is one that<br />will do what Trump says to avoid being removed.<br />In class the discussion surrounding Pam Bondi<br />being a possible contender for removal was really<br />interesting and upon looking further into Trump's<br />frustration with her I can see her being removed.<br />That being said, I firmly believe that Trump<br />picked his cabinet with people who are going to<br />make sure his agenda gets passed through and have<br />more of a complacent leadership style. I do not<br />see Trump having to remove people other than lower<br />level federal employees as he has already been<br />doing.","Alizah Mudaliar (40%): It is probable that a<br />member of Trump’s cabinet will either be fired<br />or resign by November 25. The last time a cabinet<br />member was fired during the first year of a<br />presidency was under Trump’s presidency in 2017.<br />Since returning to office, his cabinet is more<br />complacent and satisfies Trump’s agency, reducing<br />the chance of being fired. If they are perceived<br />well by Trump and his supporters, then they are<br />more likely to remain in their positions. Unless<br />a huge scandal, unlike ones that have already gone<br />ignored, it is unlikely a cabinet member will get<br />fired or resign in the next two months.","Amanda Neighbour (35%): Trump recruited a loyal<br />cabinet for his second term. Despite him having<br />almost 20 resignations within 3 years during his<br />first term, they were after the first year was<br />complete. Cabinet members have only been fired<br />once before the end of the first year, which was<br />Tom Price in 2017. If his cabinet has made it<br />thus far, I believe a resignation or a firing<br />within the next two months is unlikely. There are<br />possibilities such as Kash Patel, Pam Bondi, RFK<br />and Pete Hegseth as they are under a lot of public<br />pressure and dislike. However, he is content<br />with people disliking himself and his cabinet, so<br />doubtful it will change anything. Unless an event<br />like a signal chat leak or some form of political<br />discourse erupts, like the Epstein files, it is<br />unlikely anything will happen","Ana Valencia (40%): Given the current movement<br />within the conservative party after Charlie<br />Kirk's death as well as to avoid controversy due<br />to the pressure to release the Epstein files,<br />the current administration might see it as<br />beneficial to attract little to no controversy<br />on the instability of the President's cabinet.<br />The base rates for Trump's cabinet turnovers have<br />been with about 75% of his first-term Cabinet<br />members leaving before the end of four years,<br />compared to fewer than 10% departures in the first<br />year of most other modern presidents. However,<br />Trump has been able to have more loyalists in<br />his current cabinet who have already a lot of<br />controversy around them so there seems they would<br />not be fired over policy decisions or dissent.<br />He only has recently fired Mike Waltz and Rebecca<br />from the agencies this year so unless there is a<br />controversy bigger than the Epstein files then no<br />one seems to lose their job in the internal circle<br />before November.","Anna Barton-Caucci (40%): I think there is a 40%<br />chance that a member of Trump's cabinet will drop<br />out before the end of the semester because Trump<br />has consistently had members of his administration<br />leaving throughout his presidencies. He recently<br />fired his National Security advisor, Mike Waltz,<br />and is known for having a high staff turnover<br />rate. The work environment for his administration<br />is pretty hostile and there has been a good<br />amount of controversy. However, I also think he<br />has a lot of loyalists in his staff during this<br />administration and the next 2 months is a tight<br />timeline to expect someone to leave.","Anna Kneser (36%): A resigning or firing from a<br />president's cabinet is incredibly rare, but it has<br />happened under Trump before. His current cabinet<br />members are facing exit pressure through alleged<br />sexual misconduct and being accused of having<br />weak credentials. However, these current members<br />were chosen based on loyalty, which makes internal<br />conflicts less likely. The question I'm asking is<br />will the external conflicts overrule the internal<br />conflicts and cause members of cabinet to leave?<br />In short, I do not think so. Cabinet members have<br />significant influence and have access directly<br />to the president, and I don't foresee these<br />politicians wanting to give up this power.","Blake Martin (38%): I think there is a 38% chance<br />that someone from Trump's cabinet will be fired<br />or resign. From Trump's previous administrations<br />there have been previous trends of a strong<br />precedent for departure, which pushed my<br />probability to be higher. On the other hand, other<br />reports show that Trump's second-term appointments<br />are chosen mostly by loyalty. This means that<br />internal conflict would be less likely. With<br />enough pressure though, enough public pressure<br />could push the administration to either fire a<br />candidate or have someone resign. However, with<br />everything considered I think that the current<br />administrations loyalty to the president is so<br />strong that I don't think there will be a reason<br />for them to withdraw or get fired.","Breanne Talley (25%): I feel that the timeline<br />is a bit condensed so that the event will occur<br />before the end of November. There is one person in<br />history to leave within the first year, I feel as<br />though it's very unlikely. For this term as well,<br />I feel like Trump also picked his cabinet a little<br />more carefully than he did in his previous term.<br />All of these factors involved, I'm giving it a 25%<br />chance.","Caleb Lux (25%): This cabinet is filled with<br />loyalists, which will limit any chances for the<br />President to fire them, and the current political<br />environment is scandal-saturated, meaning a<br />typical scandal is not likely to result in the<br />firing or resignation of a top-level official. If<br />Signalgate won't kick out Pete Hegseth, we would<br />need the full release of the Epstein files to get<br />any sort of shakeup within this Cabinet.","Chris Haswell (11%): It is extremely unlikely for<br />a member of Trump's cabinet to be fired or resign<br />according to both the inside and outside view.<br />Historically, only one cabinet member was fired<br />before their first year ended. Although it was<br />under Trump, the administration has taken pains<br />to avoid this happening again, as seen through<br />Project 2025 and Trump's repeated claims that<br />he will not be undermined by the \"deep state\"<br />again. Unless there is a political scandal that is<br />simply to great to ignore or a cabinet member who<br />suddenly cannot stomach their actions, the cabinet<br />will remain intact.","Cierra Green (35%): It is less likely that Trump<br />will fire a cabinet member and unlikely that any<br />member will resign. Looking at Trump's first term,<br />only 1 member was fired/resigned in the first<br />year (in a position that is currently a part of<br />the cabinet). Additionally, compared to his first<br />term, this cabinet is full of Trump loyalists.<br />However, a cabinet member can be fired fairly<br />quickly. Knowing Trump, many of his decisions can<br />be fast, so it is possible he would change his<br />mind on a cabinet member after a disagreement or<br />scandal. Looking at the markets, Kalshi states<br />that there is a 77% chance 0 members will be fired<br />by the end of the year. Polymarket states there is<br />a 49% chance a cabinet member will be out by the<br />end of the year.","Elizabeth Nelson (20%): I think there it is<br />unlikely that someone will exit, but I think<br />because there could be sudden disputes or qualms<br />within the cabinet it cannot be completely ruled<br />out. The behavior of Trump's first administration<br />was over a dozen resignations, however, I think<br />Trump has hired a lot more loyalists this go<br />around, so that plays another role. Apparently the<br />work environment is very hostile, but I think it<br />would not happen within the next two months just<br />because that would be a very quick turn around. I<br />think there are not as many political clashes on<br />his cabinet. As long as there are not any crazy<br />scandals that come out of the woodworks, I think<br />it is pretty unlikely.","Francesca Mariano (45%): A cabinet resignation<br />or firing in the first year of a presidential<br />administration has only happened once, but it was<br />under Trump's first administration and was due<br />to a scandal. We have seen time and time again<br />that scandals seem to have a supernatural ability<br />not to affect this administration. Trump's first<br />cabinet has the highest turnover in history, which<br />has reportedly caused him to intentionally select<br />only those extremely aligned and loyal to him<br />ideologically and/or personally. Trump and his<br />administration are known for being unprecedented,<br />and I believe they should be accounted for<br />when setting my probability. The briefs have<br />probabilities ranging from 10 to 80 percent, with<br />three of them being 35 to 40. Given these factors,<br />I set my probability at 45%.","Ellie Null (40%): I predict that there is a 40<br />percent chance that someone will resign or get<br />fired. It's more likely to be during the Trump<br />administration than any since he usually tends<br />to deal with those who are not aligned with<br />him quickly. It is more likely for it to happen<br />suddenly and not be very predictable. But I don’t<br />think right now there is an incentive to do so.<br />His cabinet is full of loyalists for the most<br />part, but the work environment and atmosphere<br />could lead to resignation in the long run. I think<br />that also since these two months are such a short<br />time line the chances will be lower. In the past<br />people who would resign had private controversies<br />that made them resign. If more scandals or other<br />things come out in the next two months that could<br />possibly put some political pressure on them,<br />but people in this cabinet tend to not pay much<br />attention to scandals or care about their media<br />perception. I think Trump has a lot of executive<br />control as of this moment. No scandal will truly<br />get someone fired or get them to quit. I think<br />that maybe if there is egregious over step or<br />abuse of power on his front there might be. This<br />is a hard prediction. I'm resting at 40 percent.","Hunter Murray (19%): I used Bayesian updating<br />based on all of the briefings, plus my own<br />prediction, with an alpha = 1.75. I think that the<br />very limited timeline of this prediction limits<br />the probability of a member of Trump's cabinet<br />leaves. This is my first time using the Bayesian<br />updating, I'm a little worried that it might have<br />been a little too extreme.","Jack Lutz (25%): I believe Trump has surrounded<br />himself with a more loyal crew this time in<br />office. While the only recent occurrence of a<br />firing/departure within the first 8 months of a<br />Presidency was under his previous administration,<br />it was due to the misuse of taxpayer money. As<br />long as no one in the cabinet is exposed for a<br />serious crime, it is unlikely that Trump will cut<br />ties with anyone.","Jackson Bost (25%): Of the major firings and<br />resignations of Trump's second term, the majority<br />of them have risen from disputes over the<br />President's agenda, leading individuals like David<br />Lebryk, then Acting Secretary of the Treasury,<br />and Erika McEntarfer, former Commissioner of Labor<br />Statistics, to resign and be fired, respectively.<br />We have to go back to the first term to find a<br />confirmed cabinet member who was fired or resigned<br />in this quick a timeframe, when Tom Price resigned<br />following the reveal of his private jet scandal.<br />The current cabinet doesn't disagree with the<br />President near as much as previous secretaries,<br />especially following a Aug. 26th cabinet meeting<br />in which they lavished him for hours, and they<br />have proven that they can power through scandal.<br />Barring any major changes to their position or<br />a truly monumental scandal, it seems unlikely<br />any will resign or be fired before the end of<br />November.","James Hunter Darke (40%): Trump's team has had<br />historically high turnover, with many leaving<br />during his prior term. I do believe that someone<br />is likely to resign, but the timeframe leaves my<br />probability lower. My other doubts that lead to<br />my 40% probability lies in the hope he learned<br />lessons from his last term, and doesn't create the<br />same conflicts this go round.","Jhaycee Barnes (40%): This Cabinet is newly seated<br />so quitting now is costly reputation-wise, and<br />there aren’t clear smoke signals that someone is<br />going to exit soon. Also at this time of year,<br />the President probably favors policy wins over<br />drama within the cabinet. Trump's first term gives<br />motivation to believe base rates are higher than<br />normal, but there are still no clear signals that<br />someone is on their way out.","Kira Fleischer (40%): Looking at an outside view,<br />only one cabinet member has been fired this early<br />in an administration. However, firings can often<br />be abrupt, deriving from an internal dispute, so<br />I avoided any extreme probabilities because this<br />event may happen suddenly. Looking internally,<br />within the first 3 years of Trumps last<br />administration there were many retirees, however<br />it is possible that he has learned from this and<br />hired more loyalists this time around. I think<br />that while there will be firings and retirings,<br />they will not happen in our timeline.","Liz Yancey (40%): I looked over everyone's briefs<br />and agreed with what was said. I think there's<br />a 40% chance someone will be fired or resign,<br />primarily because of the leaked texts to Pam<br />Bondi a few days ago. However, I agree that she's<br />too big a loyalist to resign. Even though those<br />were messages between Bondi and Trump, it still<br />signaled the recklessness of this administration.<br />Paired with the Signal leak from earlier this<br />year, I could see another blip occurring, but<br />nothing major. A large part of my concern is<br />that people are beginning to call Kash Patel<br />into question because, without Tyler Robinson's<br />parents, the FBI would most likely not have caught<br />him post-Charlie Kirk's assassination. However,<br />I don't think any backlash he has received would<br />cause him to resign or lead to Trump firing him,<br />due to his devout loyalty to the administration.","Manuv Datta (80%): Yes, a Trump cabinet head<br />will resign or be fired by November 25th.This<br />reflects Trump’s uniquely high cabinet turnover,<br />his loyalty first management, frequent policy<br />clashes, and scandal risk. It is my belief that<br />the nature of Trump's demand of \"loyalty\" is<br />fluid. Defintions of what is required of his<br />loyalty will change, as they have in the past with<br />previous cabinet heads. His first term saw record<br />turnover, intense infighting, and reliance on<br />acting officials, conditions that raise exit odds.<br />Any resignation counts, including for personal or<br />health reasons, and the window runs during early<br />governing turbulence, so at least one cabinet head<br />is very likely to leave before November 25th.","Mateo Ceron (33%): Through conversation in class<br />and reading the briefings made by my classmates,<br />I decided that I would try one of the theories<br />that we learned about in class. Using the formula<br />we were given for extremizing, I landed on a 31%<br />chance that a member of Trump's cabinet would no<br />longer hold their position because of a firing<br />or resigning. However, because of the volatility<br />of the Trump administration (and Trump himself) I<br />added another 2% just to feel a little bit better.","Nic Curtis (12%): I find it extremely unlikely<br />that one of Trump's cabinet members will be fired<br />or resign. As Chis H. stated in his briefing, only<br />one cabinet member has ever resigned prior to the<br />end of a president's first time, which occurred<br />during Trump's first term. In addition to this,<br />many of the cabinet members were chosen by Trump<br />due to loyalty and agreement on issues, unlike<br />his first term. The person who resigned during<br />his first time was due to scandal. There have<br />been many scandals that have occurred during this<br />first year and yet no member has been fired or has<br />resigned. I also think it is important to consider<br />the cost of having to appoint another cabinet<br />member. Does Trump have the political capital to<br />push for another member? It's possible, but it<br />another factor to consider.","Owen Johnston (30%): While in the first Trump<br />Administration there was a record-breaking<br />number of firings at early points in the<br />administration's term, the Second Trump<br />Administration is different. The first cabinet<br />reflected a more diverse set of opinions, while<br />this new administration is made up of extreme<br />loyalists. This, I think, makes it unlikely for<br />a firing to occur because it is unlikely for<br />policy disagreements to occur. Even when looking<br />at scandals, such as Pam Bondi's handling of the<br />Epstein Files or Hegseth's sharing of classified<br />information on Signal, no firings occurred. Thus I<br />give a 30% probability of a firing occurring.","Paul Frilingos (36%): Like I did last week,<br />extremizing the probabilities from the briefings<br />with an alpha value of 1.5 for moderately<br />independent information, I get a probability of<br />36%. This feels about right to me. I think this<br />cabinet seems very stable (for a Trump cabinet)<br />and there don't seem to be any obvious concerns<br />that would cause a resignation or firing.<br />However, I wouldn't bring it any lower because<br />Trump administrations have proven to be very<br />unpredictable and something unforeseen could<br />easily happen.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (40%): I think<br />there is a 40 percent chance that a member of<br />Trump’s cabinet will be fired or resign before<br />November 25. Trump has a history of unusually high<br />turnover and also his second-term cabinet is built<br />around loyalty. There is some criticism around RFK<br />Jr. at Health and Human Services and scrutiny of<br />Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that could still<br />create pressure for an exit. I believe that mix<br />makes it less than a coin flip, but still a real<br />possibility.","Reese Fabritius (35%): Even though Trump has had<br />a very high turnover rate in the past, this will<br />deter other cabinet members from disagreeing<br />with the President. I think they have seen how<br />previous administrations have been dealt with, and<br />they will obey his orders. Also, if they've been<br />appointed, they already align with his ideology.<br />However, Trump is notoriously unpredictable, and<br />there is always a chance with him.","Ryan Marx (25%): I believe that there is a 25%<br />probability that a Member of Donald Trump's<br />Cabinet will be fired or resign before November<br />25th. My reasoning comes from the fact that Trump<br />has historically run his administration in a<br />loyalty driven manner, with cabinet members who<br />fall out of favor with him (be it over policy<br />disagreements or just personal disloyalty)<br />being dismissed outright. Trumps first term from<br />2016-2020 had one of the highest cabinet turnover<br />rates in Modern US history with over 15 cabinet<br />members dismissed, including Jim Mattis in 2018<br />over policy disagreements and Kirstjen Nielsen in<br />2019 over Immigration disputes). This precedent<br />is what leads me to believe that there is a 25%<br />possibility for a cabinet member to resign or be<br />fired before november 25th.","Sade Ezekiel (40%): I believe that there is a 40%<br />chance that a member of Trump's cabinet will be<br />fired or resign before November 25th. According<br />to recent news, there have been no major issues<br />with any members of the Trump administration.<br />In Trump's previous presidency, he had a history<br />of firing many cabinet members due to turmoil.<br />Additionally, cabinet members did resign during<br />his first term because they disagreed with<br />his policies. Because Trump has been in office<br />before, I believe it is in the best interest of<br />the cabinet and Trump to keep the peace for the<br />betterment of the American people.","Sarah Kate Maher (40%): Some of the members of<br />Trump's cabinet are controveersial, and experience<br />enough pressure for them to resign at any time.<br />Trumps' administration has previously also<br />experienced a high level of turnover. However, I<br />am not extremely confident that one of the members<br />of Trump's cabinet will be fired or resign before<br />the end of the semester. Trump's cabinet is highly<br />loyal to him, and breaking this loyalty was one<br />of the reasons for the high turnover during his<br />last term. These cabinet members are much less<br />likely to break the loyalty that they were hired<br />on the basis of, and are therefore less likely to<br />be fired or resign. There's also not one specific<br />cabinet member that can be predicted to have a<br />falling out with Trump, though it could still<br />happen.","Sasha Mahtani (34%): While this situation where<br />a member of Trump's cabinet being fired is highly<br />likely, I give this a low probability because of<br />the length of time. The rate of someone resigning<br />or getting fired especially within the first year<br />is extremely low. Trump's administration is this<br />is notorious for being very loyal to him and his<br />decisions which indicate to me that they don't<br />want to be fired. So it is possible, but I give a<br />low probability because of the time frame and his<br />loyalists's reputation this term.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (25%): A cabinet member getting<br />fired or resigning in the first year of a<br />presidency is a historical unlikelihood. For<br />Trump, however, not quite as unlikely, as two did<br />just that in his first term. A repeat this term<br />has a smaller chance because it's quite clear the<br />cabinet selection process was one based more on<br />loyalty than competency. Even the most contentious<br />cabinet members have taken the Trump-over-all<br />approach, so barring scandals, we will most likely<br />not see a cabinet shake-up in the next few months.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (40%): I believe Trump's<br />advisory cabinet is largely composed of loyalists.<br />While he values loyalty, he also has a pattern<br />of using scapegoats when under public pressure.<br />That said, he tends to stand by appointees<br />who remain loyal to him, even when they are<br />unpopular with the public. Figures like Hegseth,<br />Gabbard, Bondi, and Patel have drawn criticism,<br />yet Trump continues to back them. Unless there<br />is another major scandal, such as the Signal<br />Chat leak, I don’t expect any dismissals before<br />November 25th.Potential areas of controversy<br />include a government shutdown, which he can<br />blame on uncooperative Democrats, and the ongoing<br />controversy surrounding the Epstein files, whose<br />release is being delayed or resisted. Still,<br />absent a major disruption, I think the current<br />cabinet lineup is likely to remain intact in the<br />near term.","Zafar Ali (15%): I find it less likely that we<br />will see any members of Trump's cabinet leaving<br />or being fired. To start, I tend to look at the<br />timeframe to get an idea of how much more likely<br />the prediction will occur. November seems to<br />soon to call it, and another important factor is<br />the fact that his cabinet members are much more<br />loyal than his previous administration. Even with<br />issues such as the Epstein Files, Trump does not<br />seem bothered and will likely continue to keep<br />his cabinet as it is since they are so loyal to<br />him. Resignations are the most likely chance to<br />see this prediction happening, however, it again<br />seems unlikely because those on the cabinet would<br />probably want to remain in their positions and<br />close to Trump for their individual political<br />careers."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.81000000000000005],"y":[1.9707741800695657],"text":"Crowd (81%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,1)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.35999999999999999],"y":[0.99033391412813221],"text":"Crowd (36%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.80000000000000004],"y":[1.9767420263960958],"text":"Joe Ornstein (80%): There are plenty of reasons<br />for confidence here.

Further political turmoil and a rise<br />in more Christian-centered parties (which are<br />traditional center and far right parties) could<br />also potentially attract the voters that no longer<br />support PVV to parties that are similar in belief.<br />There has also been a previous pattern (2023)<br />of one major party falling and another taking<br />its place and rising in popularity, which is a<br />possibility in this election as well. However,<br />supporters are also less likely to openly admit<br />their allegiance to such far-right parties, but<br />the underestimation of support still won't let the<br />party win a record-breaking number of seats.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (25%): There is various<br />different polling agencies that are predicting the<br />that the highest amount of seats possible for the<br />PVV to win is around 34 seats. According to some<br />more comprehensive polling-trend organizers, PVV<br />received between 19 and 20% of the vote, which is<br />sufficient to lead the field but not by any means<br />to surpass 37 seats. Additionally, PVV is hindered<br />by two structural factors: the proportional<br />representation system in the Netherlands tends<br />to minimize severe swings, and many Dutch parties<br />still resist forming coalitions with it, which<br />can deter voters who are on the fence. Therefore,<br />even if PVV is in a strong position heading into<br />October, the evidence indicates that defeating 37<br />seats will necessitate an exceptionally favorable<br />alignment of coalition calculations, voter<br />sentiment, and turnout, which polls haven't shown<br />much support for thus far.","Alizah Mudaliar (39%): PVV won their election<br />in 2023, which was considered a shock. The Dutch<br />government collapsed this past June after Wilders<br />withdrew from the PVV and others believe his<br />interests are irresponsible and reckless. The<br />party is still favored by some due to growing<br />anti-immigration sentiments; however, they may<br />not win as many seats as they did before. Moderate<br />voters are unsure how they will vote in this<br />election, creating uncertainty if the PVV will<br />gain as many seats as it did in 2023.","Amanda Neighbour (37%): PVV's previous election<br />gaining 37 seats was considered a shock election.<br />However, since Wilders has left the coalition and<br />it has collapsed, the party is facing struggles.<br />The far-right party is gaining a reputation for<br />being anti-immigration and has taking stances<br />supporting Israel, which may harm voter turnout<br />and those who voted for PVV last time. Moderate<br />voters help secure the 37 seats and seem to<br />be backing off. PVV is still polling well,<br />however, polls have a high average error in Dutch<br />elections. It is also important to consider that<br />people are not civically engaged without an event<br />that fires them up, which could possibly be the<br />asylum seekers, if anything. There is a general<br />rise in far-right politics in Europe, but many<br />people may not want to show support outside of the<br />polls. It does seem unlikely they will gain one<br />more seat than last election.","Anna Barton-Caucci (30%): I think there is around<br />a 30% chance of the PVV winning a record breaking<br />amount of seats this election. Polymarket says<br />there is a 40% chance they will get atleast 34<br />seats and they need 37 for this prediction to come<br />true so I think it is pretty unlikely that they<br />will reach that number of seats.","Anna Kneser (30%): Based on current polling<br />averages, more district in the PVV, and the<br />current hot topics for election, I doubt that<br />the PVV will win at least 38 seats. Historically,<br />they dropped from 24 seats to 15 seats after a<br />previous government collapse in 2012. I expect the<br />same to happen this year in 2025. If a major event<br />happened within the next month, then that is the<br />only way where I would see the PVV beating their<br />record-breaking stats.","Arshia Charkhian (22%): With support for the<br />PVV waning and the resurgence of the Christian<br />Democratic Appeal, which will split center-right<br />voters, CDA support has reportedly risen from<br />around 3% in the 2023 election to an estimated<br />16% for the upcoming election. I give the PVV a<br />22% chance of winning a record-breaking number of<br />seats.","Blake Martin (36%): While the PVV is still polling<br />as the leading party, current projections show<br />them just falling short of their 2023 record of<br />having 37 seats. Their turnout among their voters<br />could be at jeopardy especially with the recent<br />cabinet collapse. Other parties are also trying to<br />specifically block PVV gains and there is no sign<br />of a late momentum pushing them higher. Therefore,<br />I give this prediction a 36% chance of winning<br />a record-breaking number of seats in the 2025<br />election.","Caleb Lux (32%): The PVV seems set to win a<br />plurality of seats once again, but I find it<br />unlikely that they will reach at least 38 seats.<br />Consistently polling below their 2023 results, the<br />PVV has lost support by collapsing the government,<br />allowing other right-wing parties to gain their<br />support. However, the PVV could coalesce support<br />in the final days of this election and create<br />another surprise result.","Chris Haswell (41%): I am not confident that PVV<br />will not gain a record number of seats. In 2023,<br />Dutch polls did not expect the PVV to gain as many<br />seats as they did, and they only need to gain one<br />seat to have a record number. Although Geert is<br />reportedly less popular than he was in 2023, right<br />wing populism is still very high worldwide. I<br />would not be surprised if they gained the one seat<br />they need to have a record number.","Cierra Green (30%): Looking at popularity polls<br />and projected seats for the upcoming election, PVV<br />may have the lead, but they are less popular than<br />in 2023. A decrease in overall popularity tends<br />to signal a decrease in seat numbers. For this<br />question, the PVV must have at least 38 seats,<br />which would be difficult to achieve. However,<br />debates have not occurred yet. Additionally, there<br />has been an increase in the voting population with<br />those who reached 18 between 2023 and 2025, but<br />it is difficult to predict their voting behaviors.<br />Looking at various sources, young men tend to<br />lean right, and young women tend to lean left in<br />the Netherlands. I also looked at Reddit posts by<br />those from the Netherlands for their opinion, and<br />some commented that the overall Netherlands youth<br />leans left. Again, it is difficult to predict<br />their behavior since they have not voted yet, but<br />their views could change the trajectory of the<br />election.","Elizabeth Nelson (31%): PVV will not win a<br />record-breaking number of seats in the October<br />29, 2025 Dutch election. Polling trends and<br />party dynamics suggest that the PVV will likely<br />stay strong, but not break the 37 seats. It has<br />gradually decreased in popularity because of their<br />stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict, so it is<br />unlikely that the PVV will break the record.","Francesca Mariano (45%): The PVV is an electorally<br />successful far-right party in the Netherlands,<br />having won the most seats in the last election<br />to a “shocking” degree. The party is still<br />considered popular, with growing anti-immigration<br />sentiments fueling their base. Overall European<br />trends show a rise in far-right politics, adding<br />to their reported popularity. Despite being<br />popular, the PVV has seen dips in polls and some<br />prediction markets, suggesting that while still<br />likely being successful overall, they may not<br />surpass their previous seat-share. Given this,<br />I predict PVV has a 45% probability of winning a<br />record-breaking number of seats in the Dutch House<br />of Representatives on October 29.","Ellie Null (39%): I predict that there is a 39<br />% chance that the PVV will win a record-breaking<br />number of seats in the Dutch House of<br />Representatives on October 29. A similar situation<br />happened in 2012 with the government. From that<br />experience the house of representatives went down<br />from 24 to 15 seats. Currently they have to build<br />a coalition government to get the majority of the<br />house. Their closest individual competitors are 12<br />seats behind them. Originally some people see that<br />PVV's popularity as shocking and how many people<br />were voting for them. But now people are backing<br />off of this party. They are still polling well,<br />but not as successful as they normally are.","Hunter Murray (42%): My base case is that Geert<br />Wilders’ PVV finishes first on October 29 but<br />does not quite beat its 2023 record of 37 seats.<br />Current polling bands (PVV ~29-35 seats) and<br />late-campaign dynamics, especially (1) domestic<br />tensions around Dutch policy toward Israel and<br />(2) the CDA’s rise while NSC collapses, reshaping<br />the right-of-center vote. Both point to a ceiling<br />just below 37. Polling ceiling: PVV leads, but<br />averages still sit below 37 Ipsos I&O (Sept 29):<br />PVV 31 seats; CDA 25; GL-PvdA 23. Ipsos also notes<br />the far-right riots in The Hague did not shift<br />preferences materially; i.e., no late momentum<br />bump for PVV (Ipsos I&O). Peilingwijzer average<br />(updated Sept 17): PVV modeled 29-35 seats;<br />i.e., consistently below 37. NOS, summarizing<br />the Peilingwijzer, also sets PVV’s current band<br />at 29-35 (Peilingwijzer; NOS). Other trackers<br />(PolitPro live read-outs): PVV around ~20% vote<br />share in late Sept panels, compatible with low-30s<br />seats, which is again below record territory<br />(PolitPro). Implication: With less than a month<br />to go, PVV’s central tendency remains short of<br />37; breaking the record would require a late swing<br />that current data don’t show. Domestic tensions<br />over Israel policy are injecting volatility,<br />not PVV growth The government’s tightened export<br />controls for Israel-destined military/dual-use<br />goods (April) and subsequent cabinet ruptures<br />have kept the Israel/Gaza file at the center of<br />politics (Reuters). In August, Foreign Minister<br />Caspar Veldkamp (NSC) resigned after failing to<br />secure broader sanctions on Israel, deepening<br />the cabinet crisis and spotlighting internal<br />divides on Israel policy. Major protests added<br />pressure (The Guardian). Coverage describes<br />how the sanctions/boycott debate fractured<br />the caretaker alignment and fueled public<br />mobilization, with the Netherlands even banning<br />two far-right Israeli ministers earlier in the<br />summer (AP News). Why this matters for PVV’s<br />ceiling: PVV’s brand benefits from polarization<br />on migration and security. But the Israel policy<br />fight has splintered governing-camp parties<br />and depressed trust overall, without producing<br />measurable late-September gains for PVV (Ipsos<br />shows PVV flat around 31–32) (Ipsos Report). CDA’s<br />rise + NSC’s collapse complicate PVV’s path to<br />expansion CDA is surging: Multiple outlets show<br />CDA climbing into the top two, with ~24-25 seats<br />in early-to-mid September and further momentum<br />through late September. Henri Bontenbal also<br />tops “preferred PM” polling, which is useful for<br />undecided center-right voters seeking stability<br />(Dutch News; NL Times; NL Times on Bontenbal). NSC<br />is imploding: Ipsos pegs NSC at 0 seats on Sept<br />15, and Peilingwijzer shows 0-1; Verian similarly<br />calls out NSC’s near disappearance (Verian Group).<br />Where do those voters go? Analyses highlight CDA’s<br />“steady climb” as NSC erodes; expert write-ups<br />(Stuk Rood Vlees) underline how NSC’s remaining<br />appeal is thin while CDA is on an “opmerkelijke<br />opmars” (“remarkable rise”) (Stuk Rood Vlees).<br />Mechanism: PVV already commands a relatively loyal<br />base, but Ipsos notes turnout uncertainty among<br />PVV-leaners and that multiple parties exclude<br />PVV from coalition talks; which are two factors<br />that cap late tactical inflows. Meanwhile, CDA<br />is attracting the “stability” voter that NSC has<br />lost, pulling support from the same broad market<br />PVV would need to exceed 37 (EenVandaag). Risk<br />factors to my call (what would push PVV above<br />37) Turnout asymmetry: If PVV mobilizes its base<br />unusually well relative to others, the seat math<br />could stretch toward the mid-30s. Ipsos flags PVV<br />voters as more certain of choice but less certain<br />to vote (Ipsos Report II). Late-campaign shock:<br />A security or migration shock that reframes the<br />agenda could benefit PVV. As of the Sept 29 Ipsos<br />wave, however, even the Sept 20 Hague riots didn’t<br />shift preferences (Ipsos I&O). Given (a) PVV’s<br />persistent 29-35 seat band, (b) Israel-policy<br />tensions producing turbulence without measurable<br />PVV gains, and (c) CDA’s momentum alongside NSC’s<br />collapse, my probability that PVV will beat 37<br />seats is 42%.","Jack Lutz (38%): While the PVV's record number of<br />seats was achieved rather recently, I think it is<br />more likely than not that they will not win more<br />than 37 seats in the upcoming election. Europe<br />as a whole is experiencing an uptick in far-right<br />support, and this is what PVV ran on previously;<br />however, their inadequacy and self-removal from<br />their coalition bring doubts. Additionally, their<br />far-right niche is now being exploited by other<br />groups in an attempt to catch more of the popular<br />vote and obtain more seats in the legislature.","Jackson Bost (36%): The PVV has not gathered<br />any momentum heading into this snap election,<br />as shown by their stagnation in polling numbers.<br />On top of that, the CDA's growth in recent polls<br />signals a strong alternative for right of center<br />voters, and the incorporation of key agenda<br />points only threatens to pull more voters away<br />who were only drawn to subjects like housing.<br />There is, admittedly, still a strong base of PVV<br />and anti-immigration supporters, which showed<br />themselves in the recent Hague riots. Viktor<br />Orban's far-right party Fidesz lost seats in the<br />2006 elections in part because they could not<br />unite the opposition, which is the same thing the<br />PVV has failed after dissolving the government.","James Hunter Darke (47%): I do not believe they<br />will win a record breaking number of seats. The<br />polling numbers show that they will win 29-35<br />seats. This is lower than their previous seat<br />share. While European trends show an increase in<br />far right politics, I still do not think that they<br />will win a record breaking number of seats.","Jhaycee Barnes (27%): While the PVV is favored<br />to win the most seats, 37 seats is a lot to pass.<br />Polls are consistently putting the party in the<br />low 30s, and many voters still think that Wilders<br />is the reason that the government collapsed in<br />the first place, preventing some gains. European<br />far-right parties are gaining more attention, but<br />I think something super unusual would nee","Kira Fleischer (40%): It was seen as a shock<br />when PVV won so many seats in 2023. Now, however,<br />some of these voters are frustrated with their<br />government, and I anticipate will fall off the PVV<br />bandwagon. PVV is polling well, and I therefore<br />expect them to gain a significant number seats, I<br />just do not see them breaking the record. However,<br />there is a still a month until the election,<br />leaving plenty of time for sudden events to impact<br />the election.","Kristoffer Fields (30%): While it’s not highly<br />probably due to their majority representation<br />as well as the fact that it is a small number of<br />seat I think the reason why I say 30 as opposed<br />to say 60 or 70 percent is because according to<br />the polls the confidence in the cabinet has been<br />substantially dropping since the rise of the far<br />right in Europe a few years ago","Liz Yancey (35%): I looked over what everyone said<br />and did some research myself. I found that the<br />PVV is leading, but not by a significantly large<br />margin, and that compared to previous numbers,<br />the PVV seems to be performing worse today than<br />before. Meaning that for them to reach this<br />record-breaking threshold, they would need to<br />surpass the current polls. I think it also depends<br />on whether any ground-breaking events happen<br />politically in the area before the election. There<br />was mention of a girl or young woman being killed<br />by an asylum seeker, and that could get people to<br />the polls, but it still would have to push voters<br />to turnout in numbers greater than previous highs,<br />and that seems somewhat unlikely.","Manuv Datta (32%): The PVV will not win a<br />record-breaking number of seats in the Dutch<br />Parliament in the 2025 elections. I root this<br />prediction on the analysis of the internal view,<br />that the Dutch parliament system has such a large<br />array of political parties (15 parties), that it<br />will rather difficult for the PVV to dominate once<br />more and break their own record number of seats in<br />the next election. I also partially base my claim<br />on the external view that a single political party<br />breaking a record number of seats in back to back<br />years is statistically unlikely across the vast<br />majority of European Parliaments.","Nic Curtis (38%): The PVV currently has 37 seats<br />in the Dutch House of Representatives, needing<br />only one more seat in the next election to Winn<br />a record breaking number. I am leaning towards<br />the probability that they will not earn a record<br />breaking number. I have a few issues with going<br />above 50%. The PVV is polling right now at 30<br />seats out, less than what they have at the moment.<br />The PVV has also been seen as increasingly less<br />popular compared to where they were elected<br />due to their stance on the Israeli conflict.<br />Despite this, there has been a rise in right<br />wing government in Europe. There is also a month<br />left before the election, so a lot can happen<br />especially with debates. In the 2023 election, the<br />polls predicted that PVV would earn 25 seats, when<br />in actuality they gained 37.","Owen Johnston (15%): I believe it is unlikely<br />that the PVV will win a record-breaking number<br />of seats. While they were able to secure a snap<br />election, poll numbers indicate overall trust in<br />the PVV is not that high and the PVV is taking the<br />blame for the government shutdown. Also Wilders's<br />poll numbers have decreased as well. Because of<br />this I give it a probability of 15%.","Paul Frilingos (17.5%): My initial prediction<br />was 10%, as I think this is very unlikely, but<br />combining the predictions from the other briefings<br />I bring it a little higher. Still, I think it's<br />very unlikely to happen. Snap elections typically<br />do not mean good things for the party with the<br />most power. Polls have the PVV done from where<br />they've been, and there's just a general sense<br />that voters aren't as into them. Spending some<br />time on Dutch subreddits it seems that many on the<br />right voted for the PVV in protest, but now that<br />the PVV hasn't really done anything their going<br />back to other parties or joining new ones.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (20%): I would<br />put the odds at 20% that the PVV wins 38 or more<br />seats. Current polling places the party in the<br />29–35 seat range, not above the 2023 high of<br />37. The party is still the frontrunner and could<br />benefit from late-campaign shocks. However, the<br />fallout from the Schoof cabinet collapse and<br />the rise of competitors like the CDA can limit<br />its upside. Therefore, I think a new record is<br />unlikely.","Reese Fabritius (40%): Even though I think that<br />they will definitely do well in this election,<br />I am just not convinced that a right-wing wave<br />will hit. I think many people will blame them for<br />the government shutdown and will instead turn to<br />alternative parties. They have dipped in recent<br />polls, and I think this will be an accurate<br />depiction.","Ruhi Doddamani (33%): With a large majority<br />(82%) of PVV voters still expressing confidence<br />in Wilders, I’m inclined to temper my prediction<br />away from quite so certain on the no end. Many<br />voters believe it's not due to him or the PVV, but<br />others’ hindrances why the cabinet has achieved<br />so little. Geert Wilders himself is also critical<br />of other parties and recently threatened to<br />collapse the government if other parties were to<br />change asylum policy following an advisory opinion<br />from the Council of State. Not all PVV voters<br />are happy about this — 39% find it unacceptable<br />for politicians to openly threaten to collapse a<br />majority and force a reelection. But, alongside<br />the hesitations of other right and centre-right<br />parties in Dutch politics, most wouldn’t want<br />another cabinet shepherded by the PVV again, and<br />would make efforts to keep them from power by<br />bolstering their own. That’s why, I’m at 33% this<br />time.","Ryan Marx (40%): I believe that there is<br />a 40% probability that the PVV will win a<br />record-breaking number of seats in the Dutch House<br />of Representatives on October 29th. My reasoning<br />is that despite being the leading rightwing party<br />with a projected 33 out of 150 available seats,<br />the fragmented voter system and the fact that<br />the polls tend to give false positives on who is<br />a likely voter, meaning that when election days<br />come, seats might be gained but with a small<br />margin of victory, such as in 2021, when the PVV<br />won 17 seats but with only 10.8% of the vote.<br />Furthermore, because of the polarizing nature<br />of the PVV as a Right-wing party, many voters<br />are likely to feel pressured to vote for more<br />moderate choices, not wanting to be associated<br />either out of fear of being criticized for being<br />associated with the party or to avoid feeling<br />responsible for the potential failure's of the<br />PVV's administration. It is for this reason that<br />I believe there is only a 40% chance of the PVV<br />gaining a record amount of seats.","Sade Ezekiel (37%): PVV (Party for Freedom) is an<br />extreme right-wing party in the Netherlands. When<br />the party was created in 2006, they won 9 seats in<br />the general election. In 2010, they won 24 seats<br />in the general election. In 2012, PVV supported<br />a group called Minority First Rutt Cabinet with<br />confidence in supply. However, due to differences<br />over budget cuts, PVV withdrew its support, and<br />the group lost 9 seats in the general assembly for<br />that year's election. Then, in 2017, the PVV won<br />20 more seats in the general election. The PVV's<br />main issue has been about trying to ban Islam in<br />the Netherlands. In this day and age, countries<br />take pride in being tolerant and accepting of all<br />religions. Many Political parties and the European<br />Union have distanced themselves from the PVV<br />because of its lack of inclusivity. I believe that<br />the PVV will not win a record-breaking number of<br />seats due to its harmful undertone.","Sarah Kate Maher (25%): In order to have a<br />record-breaking number of seats, the PVV has<br />to win more than 37 seats in the Dutch House<br />of Representatives. Since the party is gaining<br />traction, it is estimated right now that they will<br />win around 33 seats. However, the party is facing<br />some challenges in policy and public support that<br />point to it not doing as well in this upcoming<br />election. Specifically, the escalation of the<br />conflict in Israel has not helped the party.<br />Therefore, unless something changes unexpectedly,<br />I don't think that PVV will break its record.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (35%): The PVV has quickly surged<br />to dominance in the past 20 years, becoming the<br />largest Dutch party by seats and breaking the<br />record in doing so, winning 37 seats in 2023.<br />Things swiftly turned sour this year when the<br />PVV pulled out of the Dutch government coalition<br />over immigration policy. While Wilders is likely<br />seeking a prime minister position for himself,<br />current polls hardly have the PVV winning 37<br />seats, let alone breaking that record. The 29-35<br />seat projection in the polls, disillusionment with<br />government inaction, and CDA and GreeenLeft-Labour<br />party growth make a record break unlikely.","Zafar Ali (29%): The PVV made a record with 37<br />seats in 2023. They are a right-wing party focused<br />on anti-immigration and anti-Islam polices.<br />Looking back at other party records, it is rare<br />to see a party exceed there peak number of seats.<br />PVV needs at least 38 to break this record. Based<br />on prediction markets, Kalshi says that there is<br />a 35% chance to see 25 to 29 seats filled, 55%<br />for 30 to 34, and 7% for 35 to 39. The fact that<br />the predicted chance of having 38 or more seats is<br />so low, I find it much less likely to see the PVV<br />beat their past record."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.33000000000000002],"y":[0.95633756690658633],"text":"Crowd (33%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.22],"y":[0.98601709124632175],"text":"Joe Ornstein (22%): The most likely scenario is<br />that the PVV loses a few seats but remains the<br />largest party in Parliament.

Right now the polling average<br />suggests they'll win roughly 31-32 seats, and<br />historically the polls 1 month out are somewhat<br />more volatile. Since 2006, we've seen the kind of<br />polling error PVV would need roughly 18-25% of the<br />time (including in 2023, when PVV won a whopping<br />18 seats more than we would have expected based<br />on the polls a month earlier!).

This has also only<br />happened during Trump's presidency and so there<br />are no other precedents to look at. However with<br />how adamant both parties have been, neither side<br />willing to change their position, this could drag<br />on for a while. I truly don't know whether it'll<br />last longer than the last one or not, and there's<br />an equal amount of arguments for both it will go<br />longer and it won't. My prediction reflects my<br />uncertainty in relation to what will happen.","Alika Otero-Ricalde (35%): Given the history and<br />current political landscape, I think it’s unlikely<br />but not impossible that this shutdown becomes the<br />longest ever. The most likely way for a shutdown<br />to end is for Congress to pass a temporary<br />spending bill, known as a continuing resolution,<br />to give negotiators more time to resolve their<br />differences. The most recent shutdown, which<br />began in 2018, was ended by a CR. A lot hinges on<br />whether one side yields or a “clean” continuing<br />resolution can be passed. I’d put the odds at<br />maybe 20-30 % that it surpasses 35 days, depending<br />on how rigid negotiations become.","Alizah Mudaliar (42%): I do not believe that the<br />government shutdown will last longer than 35 days<br />for a few reasons. First, republicans have stated<br />they want to reach a deal by October 15. Second,<br />air traffic control staffing issues led to the<br />end of the 2018 government shutdown. Nashville has<br />shut down their incoming flights due to staffing<br />shortages, and travelers are facing the impact of<br />the government shutdown in Houston, Newark, Las<br />Vegas, and Boston. Now, 750,000 furloughed workers<br />are not guaranteed back pay, increasing pressures<br />to stop the shutdown.","Amanda Neighbour (40%): On one hand, Trump had<br />the longest previous shut down in 2018 that<br />lasted 35 days in a disagreement about the wall.<br />The government is very divided and contentious<br />at the moment, so another long shutdown seems<br />plausible. However, some Republicans like MTG have<br />already agreed on the provision to the Affordable<br />Care Act, the hold up for the Democrats in the<br />continuing resolution, which could swing the vote<br />and get the government started again. This case<br />is very hard to say, but I am every so slightly<br />hopeful there will be movement to resolve it<br />before election day. 78% of Americans support<br />the provision of the Affordable Care Act, and<br />Republicans may be able to fold if more people<br />know about it (through ads, etc.). As the shutdown<br />progresses and jobs halt, pressure only continues,<br />which could work in favor of a quicker resolution.","Ana Valencia (35%): The last record for longest<br />government shutdown was 35 days during the first<br />Trump administration in 2019, however, most<br />other shutdowns end in 1 to 3 weeks. While the<br />Trump administration blames the Democrats for<br />the lack of compromise leading to a shutdown,<br />the political cost for Republicans rises because<br />they are the majority and shows lack of political<br />compromise. According to Kalshi estimates, there<br />is a 16% chance that the shutdown lasts more than<br />35 days but it is in the 50% estimate range for<br />lasting around 15 to 21 days. Some Republicans<br />have signaled openness on the sticking point to<br />extend ACA subsidies, including Trump hinting<br />at a health-care deal and Rep. MTG floating<br />collaboration. The Senate keeps rejecting partisan<br />bills, and Republicans there say talks start<br />only after reopening, so a near-term cross-party<br />compromise is not yet visible","Anna Barton-Caucci (25%): I think this is a very<br />unprecedented situation and we are dealing with<br />a very unpredictable government so I am not too<br />sure either way. I think it is not beneficial for<br />anyone to keep the shutdown for over 35 days, but<br />I still think it is possible that because of the<br />nature of this shutdown that it lasts atleast 35<br />days.","Anna Kneser (30%): The shutdown would have to<br />last 36 days or more in order to beat the longest<br />shutdown. As a shutdown drags on, there is<br />increased pressure to get it back running again.<br />Especially because political parties are turning<br />on each other even mores now. However, the longest<br />government shutdown was under President Trump, so<br />who's to say an even longer one won't happen now?<br />However, if the shutdown drags out, both parties<br />lose. Therefore, I think that either the Democrats<br />or Republicans will either back down or make<br />concessions. Also, the phenomenon that shut down<br />the government in 2018 was air traffic control<br />staffing issues, and those impacts are already<br />starting to be felt in this shutdown. Therefore, I<br />want to sway my prediction lower at 30%","Arshia Charkhian (32%): With an election cycle<br />fast approaching and public criticism increasing<br />toward the Republican Party, I believe they have<br />a strong incentive to end this shutdown soon.<br />Keeping it going beyond the record would erode<br />their political capital. Overall, I estimate there<br />is about a 32 percent chance that the shutdown<br />could continue beyond the record.","Blake Martin (40%): I would say that there is a<br />40% chance that this shutdown goes longer than<br />the record. Most shutdowns do not last long, but<br />this one feels different. There is a lot of recent<br />tension over our healthcare and neither side seems<br />like they will budge. However, I still think that<br />public pressure and the economic fallout of their<br />being a government shutdown will probably force a<br />deal before it drags on too far. So therefore it<br />could happen, but I think that it is not the most<br />likely outcome.","Caleb Lux (26%): The shutdown currently does not<br />have an end in sight, and there doesn't seem to<br />be a sense of urgency to find a solution soon.<br />Democrats are not incentivized to find a deal<br />so long as polls keep showing voters are blaming<br />Republicans, and Republicans won't do anything<br />unless Trump tells them to. This can drag on<br />for a while, but 35 days is a lot of days. I<br />find pressures from the shutdown such as air<br />traffic control or anything else will push for a<br />resolution before the Nov. 5th mark.","Chris Haswell (42%): I am on the fence about<br />this one. On one hand, markets like Kalshi think<br />that the odds of the shutdown reaching 35 days<br />is small. Both Republicans and Democrats have<br />incentives to reach a compromise in theory. Polls<br />show that voters blame both sides for the shutdown<br />and do not think that either side has a valid<br />reason for prolonging it. However, they blame<br />Republicans slightly more than Democrats. Due to<br />how contentious the political climate is, I would<br />not be surprised if this shutdown set a record.","Cierra Green (30%): As we've seen with past<br />shutdowns, the current record holder of 35 days<br />is by far the longest. Second place is a whole 2<br />weeks short of even reaching that amount. Although<br />I believe this shutdown will last a little while<br />longer, it is hard to believe it will exceed 35<br />days and last until November 5th. Kalshi has a<br />17% chance the shutdown will last longer than<br />35 days and predicts it will be about 21 days<br />long. A Polymarket prediction places the shutdown<br />reaching 30+ days to be 28%. Adding the results of<br />a different Polymarket prediction, there is a 21%<br />chance it will last past November 4th (however,<br />there is little volume for those predictions).","Elizabeth Nelson (22%): Although partisan<br />divisions are intense, historical patterns suggest<br />strong political and economic pressure to end<br />shutdowns within a month. Public blame leans<br />toward Republicans, increasing their incentive<br />to compromise. Trump’s hardline stance adds<br />uncertainty, but it’s still more likely Congress<br />reaches a deal before November 4 than not.","Francesca Mariano (25%): The longest government<br />shutdown was under Trump's first administration.<br />Polls show that Americans are blaming the parties<br />fairly equally, with the Republican Party having<br />about a 9-point lead in blame. The second longest<br />was 21 days under Clinton. This administration<br />and its party are unpredictable; the Republican<br />majority Senate could eliminate the filibuster<br />and pass the budget with a simple majority.<br />35 days comes near election day, depending on<br />where public opinion lays blame, the parties may<br />want to end the shutdown so it does not affect<br />electoral results. Trump's admin has threatened<br />mass federal lay-offs if the shutdown continues,<br />possibly forcing Dems' hands to protect the jobs<br />of constituents. The Kalshi prediction market puts<br />the government shutdown lasting more than 35 days<br />at 16%. The 35-day shutdown was also a partial<br />shutdown, meaning it did pass some funding bills,<br />but it is currently a complete shutdown, meaning<br />no funding bills were passed. Because of this,<br />I believe there is a 25% probability that the<br />government shutdown lasts longer than 35 days.","Hunter Murray (24%): I lean very heavily that<br />this shutdown will not last too much longer (more<br />than 8 more days) for a few reasons. 1) The next<br />paycheck for federal employees is due on October<br />8th. Millions of unpaid workers will create<br />blowback that is unsavory for both Democrats and<br />Republicans. This is a substantial motivating<br />factor in getting a funding deal done, even if<br />it is just a tempory stop-gap solution. 2) Trump<br />has been distracted with other priorities, namely<br />Canadian trade talks, the potential Argentinian<br />argiculture rescue package, and a hasty attempt<br />to get a bunch of nominees confirmed by the<br />Senate. All of these other tasks are going to<br />wind down in the next few days, meaning that he<br />will start catching flack for this shutdown in a<br />way that is much more present and uncomfortable<br />for him. 3) This is niche, but is something I<br />know quite a bit about. The lack of air traffic<br />controllers, particulary radar controllers for<br />approach/deparatures in high density zones like<br />NYC, Boston, LA, Charlotte, Jacksonville, and<br />Dallas, is the recipe for a runway incursion or<br />midair collision incident. There are at least<br />10 pilots in Congress, with 7 of them being<br />Republicans. Additionally, pilots nationally poll<br />nearly 70% Republican. This unique and influential<br />wing of Republicans will pile on the pressure<br />for Trump and the Republican leaders to act soon<br />with some sort of funding solution in the name<br />of aviation safety. I'll add that simply reducing<br />volume, as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has<br />stated is the plan, will not work and will anger<br />the very powerful and very finacially influential<br />airline industry.","Jack Lutz (41%): 35 days is a long time, over<br />a month, and requires a total shutdown of<br />communication to occur. While Trump has now made<br />statements regarding furlough pay, which will<br />press legislators even more to give in, one side<br />may cash in on the bad press and angle it so that<br />it is entirely the fault of the other side, a<br />political torpedo in reelection chances. Overall,<br />however, I doubt this shutdown will last 36 days,<br />but I do expect a long struggle.","Jackson Bost (45%): The last time a government<br />shutdown was largely motivated by goals out of<br />Congress, in January 2018, Democrats quickly<br />acquiesced when then Senate Majority Leader Chuck<br />Schumer promised to have negotiations on Dreamers<br />following a new continuing resolution. Given how<br />that worked out last time and President Trump's<br />stretching of presidential power, I could see<br />Democrats being a little more hesitant to agree<br />to a CR without strong guarantees. The 2013<br />shutdown, though, featured a critical factor with<br />the threat of a default on US loans, a watershed<br />moment that helped spur a new CR. This time around<br />could feature a similar outcome if Trump follows<br />through on his rumors of withholding obligatory<br />back pay for furloughed workers. Blame, however,<br />would still reside with Republicans, making it a<br />risky move, and as we inch closer and closer to<br />midterms, Republicans may seek to back down on<br />this, particularly given that healthcare does not<br />seem as critical of an issue to their agendas.","James Hunter Darke (40%): I honestly dont think<br />it will beat the previous record of 35 days, but<br />I am also very unsure. I dont think that they will<br />let this shut down run to election day, however,<br />it will all depend on public perception like we<br />have discussed in class. Furthermore, the effects<br />of the shutdown are already being felt, and with<br />elections coming up I dont think it beats the<br />record.","Jhaycee Barnes (45%): This is a difficult one,<br />but prediction markets strongly suggest that the<br />shutdown will end before early November. Political<br />dynamics make this an interesting case. The<br />record-length shutdown was under Trump, and his<br />influence over House Republicans increase the odds<br />of a long shutdown. However economic pressures<br />and issues like the air traffic control (like<br />last time) force Congress to act because serious<br />damage. Because of this, I think it is slightly<br />more likely than not that the shutdown ends before<br />November 5th.","Manuv Datta (36%): No, this government shutdown<br />will not last longer than the previously<br />held record. I make this prediction on the<br />unprecedented nature of a government shutdown<br />lasting more than 35 days. Looking at the internal<br />view, I find the struggles and shortages the<br />federal government is facing is far too intense of<br />a pressure to last longer than 35 days.","Nic Curtis (42%): 35 days seems like a difficult<br />number of days to beat. Because Republicans<br />are being blamed for the shut down, Democrats<br />have no incentive, politically, to come to the<br />negotiating table. I could see some Republicans,<br />like MTG, willing to negotiate on ACA cuts if the<br />political backlash gets too high. Due to the high<br />uncertainty of this event and changes taking place<br />every hour, I am going to hug close to the 50%<br />mark.","Owen Johnston (33%): Based off historical<br />precedent, most shutdowns end relatively<br />quickly. On the other hand, the longest shut<br />down in question happened under the former Trump<br />administration. I think this administration will<br />be stubborn to compromise, but on the other hand I<br />do not think they will want to catch the blame for<br />the shut down. Furthermore, we are already feeling<br />negative effects from the shut down, such as TSA<br />and Air Traffic Control staffing issues. For these<br />reasons, I give a 33% probability the government<br />shutdown will last longer than any on record.","Raquel Beatriz Caldas Laranjeira (30%): I think<br />there is a 30% chance that this government<br />shutdown lasts longer than 35 days. Most shutdowns<br />have ended within a few days due to public<br />pressure and economic strain, forcing both parties<br />to compromise. The current situation shows deep<br />polarization. Republicans refuse to include ACA<br />subsidy extensions and Democrats are holding<br />firm on protecting healthcare programs. President<br />Trump’s threats of federal layoffs makes the<br />situation more worrisome. But I think both sides<br />will face too much pressure to let the shutdown<br />surpass the 35-day record.","Reese Fabritius (30%): I do not think it will<br />last that long because I think it would look bad<br />on both sides of the aisle are political unrest<br />grows. Eventually, public opinion will weigh on<br />lawmakers even if their actual stances do not.<br />Someone will want to be the \"unifier\" who claims<br />to have saved everyone and restored order.","Ruhi Doddamani (42%): As we discussed in class,<br />this question is hard to apply an outside view<br />to on account of it never happening before<br />should it resolve. I'm closer to the middle this<br />time because I'm uncertain of how the attitudes<br />surrounding the shutdown could affect its<br />duration. Obviously the current administration has<br />weaponized the shutdown against the president's<br />political enemies, and I read a few sources<br />that claimed that Trump might deliberately avoid<br />negotiations to keep this rhetoric up, especially<br />as more and more Senate candidates start declaring<br />campaigns.","Sade Ezekiel (39%): The government shutdown<br />occurred on October 1, 2025 which was 6 days ago.<br />The shutdown occurred because of the stalemate<br />between the Republican and Democratic party. The<br />main dispute is over healthcare, foreign aid, and<br />subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Due to<br />the shutdown many have been furloughed and are<br />not able to return to work. Air traffic has also<br />been affected because many are calling in sick<br />due to not being paid, causing many flights to be<br />delayed. The purpose of the American government<br />is to make decisions for the betterment of the<br />American people. As of right now, our economy is<br />being affected and if this government shutdown<br />lasts for any longer there could be greater<br />effects within the financial market. Looking<br />at the history the parties end up coming to an<br />agreement causing the shutdown to stop. I believe<br />that the shutdown will not last more than 35 days.<br />I believe that there is a 39% chance that the<br />shutdown will last for more than 35 days.","Sarah Kate Maher (30%): 35 days is a long time<br />to beat, and in order for the current shutdown<br />to end, Congress must pass new appropriation<br />legislation that the president must then approve.<br />I think this will most likely happen before 35<br />days is up. Both parties do not want to be to<br />blame for the shutdown, and therefore both have<br />a vested interest in ending it. Similarily, with<br />Trump already holding the record for longest<br />shutdown, he (hopefully) won't want another in<br />terms of public support, though he can't win<br />again. Ending the shutdown may not come swiftly,<br />but it will not break the record.","Sasha Mahtani (22%): I say theres a low chance<br />that this government shutdown will set a record<br />as the longest, as historically, shutdowns usually<br />last a few weeks at most. Setting a record would<br />require major issues of negotiation. The economic<br />cost of a shutdown is too high which leads me to<br />believe a compromise is strongly incentivized.<br />Deals are hard because of high political<br />polarization, so the chances of the shutdown<br />being long may be higher than setting a new record<br />overall.","Shaheer Ul-Islam (35%): This current shutdown,<br />largely over cuts to Obamacare subsidies, is in<br />a deadlock. Analysts claim the most likely way<br />this shutdown ends is Democrats caving, and given<br />that three Dem senators have already voted for the<br />GOP’s continuing resolution, five more flipping<br />to end the filibuster seems to be likely soon.<br />Democrats potentially have a lot to lose with such<br />a long shutdown and a 35-day shutdown or longer<br />would be incredibly costly, both financially and<br />in the share of blame.","Zafar Ali (15%): I find it quite unlikely to see<br />this shutdown lasting longer than the last. Some<br />factors that could possibly relate to a higher<br />probabiliy are that the longest shutdown was under<br />Trump's first term, and tensions between both<br />parties are similarly high compared to the last<br />shutdown. However, I predict there is about a 15%<br />chance this shutdown surpasses the record 35 days.<br />While partisan tensions are high, the urgency<br />created by health care subsidies and federal<br />worker pay makes it far more likely the standoff<br />ends before then. Additionally, predictions<br />markets average around 15-18 percent that there is<br />a shutdown.","Sierra Cross-Thompson (25%): In forecasting the<br />2025 government shutdown, Democrats are drawing<br />a red line on extending enhanced ACA tax credits,<br />while Republicans want to keep them separate from<br />funding, creating a zero-sum standoff. The last<br />shutdown, in 2018–19, centered on funding for<br />the U.S.-Mexico border wall and ended after 35<br />days when Republicans in Congress compromised,<br />reopening the government without immediate<br />wall funding. Public opinion slightly blames<br />Republicans, and rhetoric from both parties adds<br />pressure to avoid appearing weak. Uncertainty<br />over whether furloughed federal employees will<br />receive back pay and whether healthcare subsidies<br />will continue adds another layer of tension,<br />especially with open enrollment beginning<br />November 1. Considering operational disruptions,<br />timing pressures, and partisan polarization,<br />the probability this shutdown exceeds 35 days is<br />roughly 25%."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Student,NA)","legendgroup":"(Student,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.34000000000000002],"y":[0.98989825726021086],"text":"Crowd (34%)","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Crowd,NA)","legendgroup":"(Crowd,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.29999999999999999],"y":[0.9742447863332927],"text":"Joe Ornstein (30%): The reason the 2018-2019<br />shutdown lasted 35 days is that a new Congress was<br />being sworn in at the end of January, so Democrats<br />had no incentive to make concessions before<br />gaining a majority in the House. There is nothing<br />similar this year that is motivating the parties<br />to prolong the shutdown. So what is the event that<br />will force a resolution? I could easily see this<br />going either way, but, to my mind, the most likely<br />scenario is that Nov 1 open enrollment on the ACA<br />exchanges will encourage the White House to reach<br />a compromise on extending subsidies (and silently<br />thank Democrats for throwing them a lifeline,<br />since a dramatic increase in health insurance<br />premiums would create a big political risk in next<br />year's midterms).","type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,255,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,255,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(Joe Ornstein,NA)","legendgroup":"(Joe Ornstein,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,1.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will this government<br />shutdown last longer than<br />any on record (more than<br />35 days)?"],"tickvals":[1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will this government<br />shutdown last longer than<br />any on record (more than<br />35 days)?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","layer":"below","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"3ac432bf5e19":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"3ac479671ad9":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"3ac432bf5e19","visdat":{"3ac432bf5e19":["function (y) ","x"],"3ac479671ad9":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
