In a majority of our games,<br />I felt that we were nearly guaranteed to win<br />at about 95% chance of winning. Our games with<br />Alabama and Texas dropped our chances considerably<br />as I felt we had a 40% and 50% chance of winning<br />respectively. Taking into account our record<br />against Alabama and Texas' new talent I felt these<br />were accurate, bringing the probability of going<br />undefeated to about 15%.","Brooke McDermott (80%): I reviewed the ESPN power<br />ranking chart that we talked about in class.<br />UGA was ranked 1st in their team strength, which<br />leads me to think they have a high probability<br />of doing extremely well in comparison to lower<br />ranked teams. However, their REM SOS is at a 3,<br />due to their schedule being relatively challenging<br />with teams like Bama and Texas on their docket.<br />However, with the loss of Saban this past season,<br />Alabama may falter, leaving Georgia more likely<br />to win. In contrast, a lot of sports analysts and<br />announcers have openly debated the Texas v. UGA<br />game and possibly the Alabama game as a potential<br />loss for UGA.","Joe Ornstein (11%): It's a much tougher schedule<br />than we've had the past two seasons, but as of Aug<br />25 we're favored to win every game. My estimate<br />is based on win probabilities implied by point<br />spreads, which tend to be very well calibrated<br />(teams cover the spread 50% of the time, with a<br />standard deviation of roughly two touchdowns).","Abby Crowe (10%): I believe that the University<br />of Georgia football team has a 10% chance of<br />going undefeated in the 2024 regular season. I<br />am basing this prediction on the College Football<br />Headquarters (CFB) odds for each individual game.<br />At a glance, UGA is favored to win every game,<br />with Alabama and Texas being the least certainty,<br />but after multiplying the probabilities against<br />each other to determine the likelihood, it no<br />longer looked too good. I landed on 9.7% chance<br />of winning all regular season games, but because I<br />love the dawgs, I’m giving them a 10% chance.","Simon Gersten (30%): To calculate the<br />probability of UGA going undefeated, I assigned<br />win probabilities for each of their games and<br />multiplied them together. Respective to their<br />schedule, probabilities of 90%, 95%, 95%, 75%,<br />75%, 99%, 99%, 80%, 95%, 99%, 90%, 99% would give<br />them a 30% chance of going undefeated.","Minha Ahmad (75%): UGA has gone three straight<br />seasons without losing a single regular season<br />game so it is very likely that they will go<br />undefeated this year as well. However, there is<br />still a bit of room for doubt which is why I am<br />not 100% sure. This season, they will be playing<br />major teams like Alabama, Texas, and Ole Miss on<br />their home turfs and not at UGA.","Haley Ford (56%): Yes- I got a probability of 56%.<br />I did a combination of equivalent bet test and<br />probability trees. I did the odds I would feel<br />most comfortable with, then used a probability<br />tree to see that likelihood. Initially- I took<br />safer odds but the probability seemed to low, so<br />I had to be more deterministic about the games<br />we would win. Clemson: 100 % (1.00) Tennessee<br />Tech: 100% (1.00) Kentucky: 100%(1.0) Alabama:<br />70% (0.70) Auburn: 100% (1.0) Mississippi State:<br />100% (1.00) Texas: 70% (0.70) Florida: 100%<br />(1.00) Ole Miss: 100% (1.00) Tennessee: 80% (0.80)<br />Massachusetts: 100% (1.00) Georgia Tech: 100%<br />(1.00)","Liv Payne (43%): I do not know much about<br />football, so I turned to the internet to figure<br />out the likelihood of UGA being undefeated. Coach<br />Kirby Smart has been at UGA since 2016. Before<br />2023, the Bulldogs had not gone undefeated since<br />1980. According to an article by Si.com, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated under Smart for<br />3 seasons in a row. Therefore, my prediction is<br />based upon Smart's performance as a coach. Out<br />of the 7 seasons that Smart has been coach, the<br />Bulldogs have gone undefeated 3 seasons. 3/7=0.428<br />or rounded up to 43%.","Jeffrey Markowitz (30%): Georgia faces the ninth<br />toughest schedule against some very strong teams<br />on the road, in difficult atmospheres to play in.<br />While the Dawgs look great going into the season,<br />college football is unpredictable. Injuries or<br />other issues could occur that are unpredictable at<br />this point.","Jessica Armour (65%): Based on the scores from<br />last years football schedule, UGA did the best<br />over all in comparison to the other teams. It was<br />also the only team (other than alabama) to win all<br />of their away games. Since away games are where<br />people struggle the most and UGA was undefeated in<br />them I would say it is pretty likely that Uga will<br />be undefeated this season. However considering<br />after being unsuccessful in maintaining undefeated<br />last year, and losing some players there is still<br />a chance they will not be, hence why I did not<br />give a perfect score for the probability.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (80%): UGA has been<br />undefeated in the past three regular seasons,<br />so I believe that winning a 4th season is not<br />an extreme idea. A CBS article by Will Backus<br />states that Georgia has the possibility of being<br />undefeated in its 2024 regular season. I consulted<br />my friend (who is an avid college football fan),<br />and he believes the possibility is there, but<br />Georgia will need to step up and prepare itself.<br />Some of the season games will be challenging, but<br />Georgia has the roster to do it.","Carson Ankeny (30%): While I do feel that the UGA<br />Football team has the roster and coaching staff<br />that could lead to an undefeated season, it is<br />still statistically unlikely that UGA could win<br />each of its most difficult matchups. Looking at<br />the schedule, there are several tough matchups,<br />including Texas and Alabama. Losing any one of<br />these or other difficult matchups would lead<br />to the forecast being broken, and I don't feel<br />confident that the Dawgs would win all of these<br />matchups, even if I expect their final record to<br />be 11-1.","Hayden Morehouse (55%): UGA is the best team<br />in college football this year. However, I have<br />been a fan for a long time, and it is tough to<br />have a perfect season. Most sports pages have<br />us projected to go undefeated, but I am a bit<br />sheepish. Things like injuries or just simply<br />a bad game can happen. We also have a tougher<br />schedule with playing Ole Miss, Texas, and Alabama<br />away.","Kira Liscombe (10%): I used the Sports Illustrated<br />predictions for each game on Georgia's 2024<br />football schedule. I converted the percentages<br />to decimals and multiplied them together. I came<br />up with a probability of 9.4, but based on other<br />articles predicting the Georgia football season, I<br />decided to predict a bit higher at 10.","Colin Barry (60%): The Bulldogs currently have<br />their projected win total set at +/-10.5, meaning<br />the consensus opinion is that they are likely to<br />lose a game. This comes from a tough schedule and<br />a newly expanded playoff system that leaves them<br />with much more room for error and makes them more<br />accepting of a single loss. This loss could come<br />from one of our powerhouse matchups at Alabama,<br />Texas, or Ole Miss, or could come from a trap<br />game no one sees coming (see Auburn last year,<br />or anytime we've played South Carolina at noon<br />for reference). That is why i think that the odds<br />Georgia goes undefeated are still slightly more<br />likely than not at around 60%, as even with all<br />these changes this season they are still the best<br />team in football.","Franco Bravo (25%): After talking to multiple<br />sources and friends who know a good amount of<br />college football, I believe that UGA will lose<br />at least 1 game in the season. The season is<br />unpredictable and with Big Name teams like Texas<br />and Alabama, I believe that UGA will fall to<br />at least one of those teams. Additionally, like<br />last season, UGA is also capable of getting into<br />unnecessary close games that have no reason being<br />that close and some can argue that those wins came<br />with some skill but also some sort of luck.","Corinne O'Dell (9.25%): Based on the win<br />probabilities for each individual game that UGA<br />will play, you can multiply those together to<br />get an overall probability. It is relatively low<br />because with us playing Alabama and Texas in a<br />regular season game, it is very unprecedented so<br />the games are currently predicted to be toss ups.l","Shayna Van Glish (8.9%): (Detailed in much more<br />length in the briefing I completed for this<br />question) I think that there is a 8.9% chance that<br />the Bulldogs go undefeated in the regular season<br />due to the fact that they have a tough away game<br />schedule, injuries that will occur, and a team<br />that has a lot of new players working to mesh well<br />with the returnees. While this number is fairly<br />low, my overall predictions for each game are<br />fairly high, yet not guaranteed wins for many.","Vikram Bharadwaj (37.5%): In the past 24 year,<br />only one team ranked number one in the preseason<br />polls has won 2 or more highly ranked (top 10)<br />away games, with the five others losing one or<br />both of these matchups. If we ignore this and look<br />at just 3 ranked away games, the record goes up<br />to 2/7, or about 28.6%. Now being a bit generous<br />here, we can round that up to 37.5, given that<br />UGA has done well in the past and is the betting<br />favorite in all three high ranked road games.","Abigail V. Harris (1%): I used the Sports<br />Illustrated power index ratings for the UGA<br />2024 regular season lineup. I multiplied the<br />chance the Bulldogs won each game by the chance<br />they would win the next game and so on and so<br />forth until I had factored in their chance of<br />winning all 12 games in a row. In the end I got<br />a .096409641377167/10 chance that the Dawgs go<br />undefeated. Out of 100 thats .96409641377167, so<br />I rounded up and estimated their probability of<br />going undefeated would be about 1/100.","Findleigh Ague (68%): I don’t know a ton about<br />football, but I tried my best to read up on what<br />the vibes are with UGA’s schedule this season.<br />There are definitely going to be some tough<br />games this season, but I think that perhaps not<br />making it to the national championships last<br />year after winning back to back could be a strong<br />motivator for the team and lead them to victory<br />in the regular season. I also looked at ESPN’s<br />Football Power Index, and not all of the data<br />points directly applied to going undefeated in the<br />regular season, but in general it looks as though<br />their simulations that they conducted had UGA<br />winning a lot.","Gracie Culpepper (37%): Alabama will be a tough<br />game for the Dawgs. We historically have very<br />close games with them, and on top of that their<br />game this season will be in Tuscaloosa. For<br />football teams, it is more difficult to win<br />the game if they are not in their home stadium.<br />Because of this, I think that it is more unlikely<br />that UGA will have an undefeated regular season<br />with this game added into their schedule.","Alexis Frazer (65%): I started with the baseline<br />probability of going undefeated, then factored<br />into account each team's probability of beating<br />UGA. Taking into account Georgia's records in<br />the 3 most recent years, the probability of going<br />undefeated would be greater than any other SEC<br />team. The Alabama game could go unfavorably (based<br />off the SEC champ game last season), however,<br />because they lost their head coach and multiple<br />starters, Bama's likelihood of beating UGA is<br />lower this year than last. UT is not going to be<br />a problem given it is their first year in the SEC,<br />so on, so forth, until I came to 65%.","Erin Ho (5%): The reason I chose this estimate<br />is because I looked up UGA’s upcoming football<br />games and made my own estimate based on what I<br />knew about UGA and what I knew about the teams we<br />were playing. I multiplied all the values I made,<br />because this is what I think are our chances of<br />winning consecutively, no possibilities of losing<br />at all. I initially thought of 78%, because that’s<br />the median for all the percentages, but this<br />seemed more correct to me.","Victor Avila (80%): I believe the FED will decide<br />to lower its rates at its September meeting with<br />an 80% probability. I came to these findings<br />through researching the history of the Federal<br />Interest Rates and how long they typically peak<br />and fall. Rates most recently peaked in August<br />2023 at 5.33. I then found a point in time with<br />similar rates and similar inflation (2.9). This<br />year was 2006. ⅘ similar scenarios have rates<br />peaking for about a year before the FED drops<br />rates. August 2024 makes a year that rates have<br />been steady at 5.33 as I anticipate them lowering<br />in september.","Reece Slater (22%): I first examined all preseason<br />#1 ranked college football teams since 1990 and<br />looked at the frequency of an undefeated regular<br />season. First I did SEC only teams, which was<br />33.3%, then I looked at all teams which was 40.9%.<br />I then used the tree branch (visualization) method<br />and multiplied all of the probabilities that UGA<br />would win each game according to ESPN Analytics.<br />This gave me a probability of 8.7% that UGA goes<br />undefeated. I then used the equivalent bet test<br />to find where my gut feels in the middle of this<br />data. This brought me to my conclusion of 22%<br />probability.","Leo Zegarra (60%): Although it may seem very<br />unlikely given the schedule this year, I believe<br />that the dawgs will go undefeated mainly due to<br />their depth. Because injuries occur so often in<br />football and teams are usually held back from<br />their potential as result, UGA simply shines<br />in the aspect of roster depth. Obviously, Kirby<br />Smart and his coaching staff is also exceptional,<br />meaning that this season will be backed up by<br />great minds and a great Carson Beck. Plus, 15<br />dawgs were named to the all SEC team, including<br />numerous offensive linemen, which are key to<br />allowing a great QB work his magic. Plus, UGA<br />has great defensive players who were named, which<br />prevents easy scoring. All in all, the teams they<br />are facing aren't as strong, especially when you<br />look at Alabama, who lost their head coach and<br />three outstanding players to the transfer portal.","Matthew Harvey (75%): My reasoning behind<br />assigning this number involves several factors<br />including my confidence level, regular season<br />games, starting rosters of the UGA, as well as<br />starting players for other teams. UGA is rated,<br />according to the Football Power Index, to be the<br />favorites to win the SEC as well as being the<br />favorites to make it to the National Championship<br />game as well. This index should let alone give<br />UGA a 50% chance of success in the regular season.<br />However, the issue is that other teams that are in<br />the top 5 likely teams to have a chance of winning<br />the national championship are among the teams UGA<br />has to play in the regular season. They are both<br />away games which also are historically shown to be<br />more difficult for away teams to win if the games<br />are determined to be contested. Therefore I am<br />confident this puts UGA directly between 100% and<br />50%.","Rommy Etzion (0%): The real question is what<br />are the odds Georgia is going to lose 1 game.<br />According the predictions made by \"Dawn of the<br />Dog,\", there are 3 games they are expected to<br />lose. So the question is if there's a probability<br />they win instead of lose. According to the<br />websites predictions, there is an expected game<br />where the dogs lose 52-17 and another 38-12. If<br />calculating the probability that UGA turns it<br />around, it would be very low. Going undefeated is<br />incredibly hard and statistically, based on expert<br />predictions, unlikely. A single loss means they<br />would not have an undefeated record, and there<br />are 3 predictions of a loss. Sorry to sound like a<br />pessimist, I also don't know much about football.","Alex Vrolijk (60%): I chose 60% because while I<br />believe UGA is one of the if not the best team<br />going into the upcoming season, we have some<br />difficult away games. The away games I am most<br />worried about are the Alabama and Texas games<br />because Alabama has had a lot of roster changes<br />and Texas is predicted to be a very strong team.","David Daniels (10%): To put my conclusion shortly,<br />no. After referring to resources made available<br />to the public (these including professional<br />sports analyzers, and betting odds) it becomes<br />apparent that the probability of some games<br />(let alone the whole) is less than a coin flip.<br />Considering that there are 12 games in the<br />regular season, someone without any college<br />football would deduce that the probability is<br />simply 0.5^12 equaling roughly 0.024%. However,<br />some of these games are not a coinflip. A decent<br />portion of the games in our conference have UGA<br />favored significantly. Sport analysts essentially<br />dismiss all games with exception to a few, Ol<br />Miss Texas, and Alabama. In these games we are<br />also the favored team. Projected Outcomes 2024<br />Schedule: 1. Clemson Georgia's odds: 82.3%<br />2. Tennessee Tech Georgia's odds: 99.0% 3. at<br />Kentucky Georgia's odds: 88.0% 4. at Alabama<br />Georgia's odds: 59.1% 5. Auburn Georgia's odds:<br />88.4% 6. Mississippi State Georgia's odds: 93.9%<br />7. at Texas Georgia's odds: 52.4% 8. Florida<br />Georgia's odds: 85.3% 9. at Ole Miss Georgia's<br />odds: 78.8% 10. Tennessee Georgia's odds: 79.4%<br />11. UMass Georgia's odds: 99.0% Figures for<br />GA Tech game 12 not available. This is what It<br />would look like to crunch these numbers: Total<br />Probability=0.823×0.990×0.880×0.591×0.884×0.939×0.524×0.853×0.788×0.794×0.990<br />Totaling in a rough probability of 9.716%, or a<br />10 on a scale from 1-100. Give these numbers it<br />is not likely that UGA will go undefeated in the<br />regular season despite being the favorites.","John Mathis (45%): I used the equivalent bet<br />test to get a read on my gut feeling, and I would<br />rather get 1000 dollars if they go undefeated<br />than guessing on a slightly weighted coin flip.<br />Furthermore, I looked at individual game win<br />chances and weighted my answer based on that.","Joe Ornstein (40%): In all of the 20th century,<br />there were only 19 years when a Category IV or<br />higher storm made landfall on the mainland US<br />(according to NOAA). Then during the first 15<br />years of the 21st century, there was only *one*<br />such year (Hurricane Charley in 2004). This is a<br />pretty low base rate. But since 2016, 5 out of 8<br />years have seen a Category IV storm make landfall<br />in the US! The key question here is whether we<br />should consider this the \"new normal\", or if we<br />should expect some regression to the mean. I will<br />split the difference between these two views.","Corinne O'Dell (52%): Based on the past fifty<br />years, there have been 9 hurricanes in the US that<br />have been a category 4 or above. Using this and<br />factoring the NOAA's predicitions for major storms<br />this upcoming season, there is a toss up chance<br />for a category 4 or above hurricane to hit.","Ryan Foley (35%): Only 23% of hurricanes in the<br />2010s that hit the mainland were category 4 or<br />above. Currently, in the 2020s we are at 25% for<br />category 4 landfalls. Combining this with the fact<br />that we are projected to have a more active than<br />average hurricane season, I concluded that 35%<br />would be feasible as it is still unlikely but not<br />quite as much as 25%.","Erin Ho (75%): I chose this estimate was because I<br />had looked at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br />Administration’s hurricane reports. Based on<br />the records from the NOAA, in years where they<br />predicted an above-normal season, there was a<br />Category IV or above hurricane. Examples are<br />Hurricane Laura in 2020 (Category IV), Hurricane<br />Ida in 2021 (Category IV), and Hurricane Ian<br />(Category IV). In May of this year, the NOAA<br />predicted we would have an above-normal season<br />for 2024. As of the end of August, we have already<br />had one tropical storm, and two hurricanes make<br />landfall in the US.","Abby Crowe (70%): I predict that there is a 70%<br />chance of a category IV or above hurricane hitting<br />the mainland United States before December 1st.<br />This prediction is based on predictions from<br />the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association<br />(NOAA) for this storm season, as well as a cross<br />comparison to previous years, their weather<br />patterns, and former NOAA predictions. (This is<br />the introduction to my brief)","Alexis Frazer (82%): Rising temperatures and<br />the consistency over the past 3 years of 1 or<br />more stage IV hurricanes striking mainland US<br />makes it very probable for a stage IV hurricane<br />to hit this year. They typically occur from<br />august-october, and are even more likely if<br />temperatures are abnormally high. The national<br />oceanic and atmospheric assosciation predicted its<br />likelihood to be 85% or higher. I calculated the<br />probability based off of data from recent years<br />and meteorologists general consensus on the issue.","Carson Ankeny (20%): Looking only at hurricanes<br />since the year 2000, it is fairly rare that a<br />category 4 storm makes landfall on the mainland<br />as a category 4. By my count, there were only<br />6 storms that made contact as a category 4 or<br />above according to the National Hurricane Center<br />and NOAA. That means that 6/24 years since 2000,<br />there was a category 4 to hit the mainland, which<br />would be a 25% chance. However, since hurricane<br />season starts in June, and we are already in<br />August (and nearly September), I think that the<br />window is closing a bit. For that reason, I marked<br />the probably slightly lower than that data would<br />suggest, at 20%.","Brooke McDermott (19%): La Niña is predicted to be<br />much more intense this coming season. Water in the<br />Atlantic is reportedly at record warmth, and in<br />addition to this, the West African Monsoon winds<br />are reportedly extremely high this season. These<br />in combination with other environmental factors<br />influencing climate change and the atmosphere,<br />there is a much higher chance that the East Cost<br />and Gulf Shore of the US may experience more<br />intense hurricane such as a Cat 4 or 5. This being<br />said, I'm unsure if the hurricane will actually<br />hit land at a Cat 4 or 5. We have seen a Cat<br />5 hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, hit the US Gulf<br />Coast this year. And with increasing intensity in<br />weather trends, it wouldn't be out of left field<br />for another large hurricane to hit the mainland.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): I think regardless of<br />any research you do this question is a tossup.<br />However, I put my probability at 15% for these<br />reasons. Since August of 2020 three category four<br />hurricanes have hit the US mainland. The last<br />one being in September of 2022. This means the<br />probability should be higher right? The reason I<br />put it so low is because my research shows that<br />August and September are the busiest months for<br />hurricanes. Three of the last four of these things<br />have hit in August, which is essentially over.<br />Giving us one more month to have a real shot at a<br />hurricane as big as category 4.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): The National Oceanic<br />and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an<br />above-normal hurricane season due to factors like<br />record-warm sea surface temperatures. 14-21 storms<br />are to occur, with 2-5 major hurricanes coming<br />from these (Cat 3 or higher). Given this forecast,<br />I think the probability of one of these hitting<br />the US mainland as a Cat 4 or higher is 25.","Minha Ahmad (60%): This year there have been<br />record breaking warm ocean temperatures, and the<br />NOAA has forecasted that there will be 4-7 major<br />hurricanes with a 3, 4, or 5 category rating<br />in the Atlantic in 2024. The last Category 4<br />hurricane was Hurricane Ida in 2021, however,<br />because 4-7 major hurricanes are predicted to hit<br />the US this year, I think that there is a high<br />chance a category 4 hurricane will be among them.","William Willis (66%): I believe that there is<br />a 66 probability that there will be a category<br />4 hurricane hit by December 1 of this year. The<br />reason behind by confidence is that the latest one<br />of these hurricanes has ever hit was November. I<br />did a little bit of research on the likely hood<br />of it happening and each weather website said<br />that warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea<br />could result in a hurricane. Also other factors<br />such as reduced vertical wind shear and weaker<br />tropical Atlantic trade winds.","Simon Gersten (25%): The current NOAA forecast<br />predicts an 85% chance of an above-normal<br />hurricane season, with 4-7 major hurricanes<br />expected this year. Given that the season is<br />likely to favor strong hurricanes, there is<br />significant likelihood of a Cat 4 or cat 5<br />hurricane occurring. Historically, the U.S.<br />mainland is hit by a Cat 4 or above hurricane<br />every 2-3 years, and given the other conditions,<br />the likelihood is higher than an average year, but<br />still not extremely likely.","Vikram Bharadwaj (10%): While in the past 24<br />years there have been six total hurricanes to have<br />hit mainland US at a category 4 or higher level,<br />four of them were either at the very beginning<br />of September or middle of August. Seeing as how<br />the NOAA gives a 20% chance of a storm forming in<br />the next two weeks, I chose to exclude those four<br />hurricanes, giving us a 2/24 = ~8% rounding that<br />up to 10 percent.","Kira Liscombe (60%): Firstly, I confirmed that the<br />Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from Sat, Jun 1,<br />2024 – Sat, Nov 30, 2024, which means we are in<br />the peak of the season. I learned that Hurricane<br />Idalia was the only U.S. landfalling hurricane<br />in 2023, and it made landfall as a category-3<br />hurricane. This gave me some doubts about how<br />likely we were to receive a category 4 this year.<br />However, I also found that NOAA’s outlook for the<br />2024 Atlantic hurricane season predicts an 85%<br />chance of an above-normal season. Considering all<br />of this i ended up with a probability of 60, since<br />there is high likeleiedhood of an active season<br />this year but low historical frequency of Cat. 4<br />landfalls.","Gracie Culpepper (40%): I'm putting my answer<br />higher for a few reasons. The first is that<br />we have 2 months left of hurricane season and<br />have already had 2 Cat-4 hurricanes since 2021<br />alone. The second is that we are in the midst<br />of a La Nina year, which makes it more likely<br />to experience turbulent weather in the Atlantic<br />Ocean. My third reason is that the NOAA's<br />prediction for this year is that hurricane season<br />may be one of the busiest on record. For these<br />reasons, I'm putting it at 40% likely to happen.","Haley Ford (13%): NOAA reports: 79% of La<br />Niña, 90% above normal season and 70% chance<br />in August/October. 8/13 storms are forecasted<br />to be hurricanes, 4-7 major hurricanes with a<br />confidence of 70%. So, I did 79%+70% /2. Then *<br />70% confidence * .25 for my guess of what chance a<br />hurricane would be 4 if it was any category.","David Daniels (73%): After extensive research<br />from weather forecast professionals, historical<br />data, and the equivalency test, I have concluded<br />a favorable probability of a Category 4 or greater<br />hurricane making landfall prior to December 1st<br />in the USA. Weather experts estimate a rough<br />probability of .70 that these circumstances prove<br />true. Likewise, in the last 7 years alone, 6<br />hurricanes have met this criteria. lastly weather<br />patterns such as La Niña and El Niño positively<br />impact the probability of a hurricane to our<br />requirements. All of these factors considered, I<br />give a probability of .73 in favor.","Edward L Tsui (23%): According to the National<br />Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane<br />Center, only two category IV and one category<br />V hurricane hit the U.S between 2011 and 2020.<br />With only being in this modern decade three to<br />4 years, there have already been two category IV<br />hurricanes. The 3 out of 19 total hurricanes in<br />the first decade leads to a 0.158 probability in<br />the decade. However, The official NOAA predicts an<br />above-normal Atlantic hurricane season with rising<br />temperatures. Thus I about 1.5X the previous<br />probability to account for weather patterns<br />increasing in temperature this season. The most<br />frequent months for hurricanes happen by September<br />but the season lasts until about November.","John Mathis (85%): 6 out of the past 7 years have<br />had at least one Cat 4 or above, with some years<br />having multople, which would be a base rate of<br />around 85%. Furthermore, we seem to be in a La<br />Nina year, which makes conditions for hurricanes<br />more favorable. NOAA lists the following factors<br />that would also increase the likelihood of a CAT<br />4: Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures<br />in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean<br />Sea. Reduced vertical wind shear. Weaker tropical<br />Atlantic trade winds. An enhanced west African<br />monsoon. Even Last year, during a very strong<br />el Nino year we had a cat 4, and due to rising<br />global average temperatures, I see no reason for<br />this to all of a sudden make a switch on a year<br />with more favorable conditions. You have to go<br />back to 2016 to find a La Nina year where aCat 4<br />did not hit the mainland US, and I theorize that<br />this was due to Hurricane Matthews path that year,<br />which went over Haiti, Grand bahamas, AND cuba<br />before reaching south carolina, giving ample time<br />and land for the storm to dissipate. This was<br />also during a weak la Nina year without the other<br />favorable conditions.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (20%): I think that<br />before hurricane season ends, we will see a<br />category 4 hurricane. However, I don't think it<br />will hit mainland US as a category 4. I looked<br />at the previous hurricanes seasons this season<br />has been compared to (1878, 1926, 1998, 2010,<br />and 2020) and only 2 were category 4 when they<br />hit mainland US. The season has been quite so far<br />because of the Atlantic Nina.","Rommy Etzion (18%): In June, the beginning of the<br />season, forecasters reported in high confidence<br />that it’s predicted to be a busy above-average<br />season (85%), with about 4-7 major hurricanes.<br />There are near-record warm temperatures, less wind<br />shear in the Atlantic which allows hurricanes to<br />intensify, and an abundant oceanic heat content<br />in the tropical Atlantic which creates more energy<br />to fuel developments. That being said, its been<br />eerily quiet in the Atlantic this month, which<br />was unexpected to forecasters, and has strayed<br />from their original forecast. This is significant<br />because August is the 2nd most active month,<br />following September. This shows that so far,<br />the forecasters overestimated the season. This<br />development significantly lowers my prediction.","Abigail Harris (70%): First I looked up some<br />of the national statistics on how likely<br />administrations thought it would be that the<br />mainland US would be hit by a major hurricane.<br />The average of those predictions came around to<br />about 60% (inflated by including CAT 3s). Every<br />three years approximately 2 major (CAT 3 or above)<br />hurricanes hit the mainland US, or it's about<br />66.67% likely. In the last 4 years, 3 major storms<br />(CAT 4 or above for my purposes) have hit the<br />mainland US at about a 75% likeliness. However,<br />I wanted to balance longterm data trends and<br />shortterm conditions by choosing a middle ground<br />that accounts for an expert prediction (unreliable<br />this far out) of about 60%. Thus, I went sightly<br />for the lower side by picking 70/100, 5 pts down<br />from the higher trend, 3-4pts from the lower.","Matthew Harvey (74%): According to Wikipedia<br />which has decent data regarding this particular<br />question, the 3 most prominent months where a<br />category 4 hurricane manifests are in August,<br />September, and October. The rough estimate of the<br />amount that have been quantified within these 3<br />months are roughly 140. The amount of category<br />4’s that have hit the mainland are around 84<br />roughly. Therefore, if you were to use the total<br />amount of category 4’s to hit landfall and put<br />that over the total amount of cat 4’s between July<br />and November being 147 you get a probability of<br />around 57%. However this takes data from in the<br />1850’s and before the Saffir-Simpson scale was<br />invented which took place in 1971. The new number<br />of landfall hurricanes is now 39 as opposed to the<br />84 previously. The amount of category 4 hurricanes<br />since 1971 has been 61. Therefore the new<br />statistic I am going with is around 63% likely.<br />The NOAA predicts that 2024 will have an above<br />normal hurricane season for 24 with putting there<br />odds around 85% likely to have an abnormal season.<br />I am going to take the mean of there score and<br />mine and put it at about a 74% likely chance we<br />will see a category 4 hurricane hit the mainland.<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Category_4_Atlantic_hurricanes<br />https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season","Colin Barry (65%): I would say that it is more<br />likely than not that a category 4 or greater<br />hurricane will make landfall in the U.S. this<br />hurricane season. The Atlantic Ocean Basin is<br />projected to be incredibly active this hurricane<br />season due to factors like increased sea surface<br />temperatures, weaker Atlantic trade winds, and<br />and enhanced west African monsoon. The season has<br />already seen the fastest formation of a category 5<br />ever with Hurricane Beryl, even if it didn't make<br />landfall. These factors point to a very active<br />hurricane season which i think has a 65% chance of<br />a category 4 or greater storm making landfall.","Reece Slater (60%): Looked at NOAA data. Looked at<br />historical hurricane data. Very high air and water<br />temperatures and El Nino/La Nina activity.","Leo Zegarra (70%): Based off of recent years,<br />there's a higher average of Category 4 hurricanes<br />hitting the mainland. The last time one hit was<br />in 2022 and they are said to hit the mainland once<br />every 3 years. Plus, there is a really high chance<br />of La Niña happening in September, which is said<br />to increase the likelihood of major hurricanes,<br />which include Category 4 hurricanes. Plus, the<br />climate in recent years has been historically<br />higher compared to years prior, which boosts the<br />probability. Plus, there is a higher probability<br />of hurricanes occurring is in the next couple<br />of months, which fits in the timeline of before<br />December 1st. Also, what is scarier than a<br />hurricane hitting the mainland is a hurricane not<br />hitting the mainland for a while. So, I am fairly<br />confident that a category 4 will hit the mainland<br />before December 1st.","Jeffrey Markowitz (75%): Hurricanes and other<br />tropical storms are becoming very common.","Liv Payne (85%): NOOA says that \", a typical<br />season will yield 14 named storms, of which<br />seven become hurricanes and three become major<br />hurricanes.\" However, this season seems to be more<br />extreme due to higher temperatures and heavier<br />rain, so they predict at 90% that this season<br />will yield above-normal results. Also, category<br />4 hurricanes hitting land seem to be increasing,<br />with 2 (Franklin and Idalia) hitting land in<br />2023. Therefore, I think it is highly likely that<br />another cat 4 hurricane will hit.","Alex Vrolijk (5%): This is because on average only<br />2 hurricanes hit mainland US per year, and we are<br />already halfway through the hurricane season. It<br />is also rare for a cat 4 or above Hurricane to<br />hit the mainland. However, there have been cat<br />4+ hurricanes that have hit US mainland in recent<br />years including in 2017, 2018, and 2022. Although<br />it is not impossible for a cat 4+ hurricane to hit<br />the mainland before Dec. 1st (with September being<br />the most active month), it is highly unlikely.","Jessica armour (20%): Based on past years, there<br />has only been a handful of Cat. 5 hurricanes to<br />hit U.S. soil, therefore it is very unlikely that<br />one will hit by Dec 2. With that being said, it<br />would be more likely that a hurricane within a<br />lower category would hit U.S. soil because they<br />are more common in occurrence than those of Cat. 5","Franco Bravo (65%): After doing several research<br />the last couple days and also talking a family<br />member who is involved in weather and climate in<br />Jamaica, he told me that it is pretty probable<br />for their to be a cat 4 storm. Also in the last 10<br />years it has happend more than half the time, so<br />hence the reason why I chose 65.","Jeffrey Markowitz (95%): Every single indicator is<br />pointing towards the Fed lowering interest rates.<br />The Federal Reserve has held multiple meetings to<br />discuss it, and it is very public that they will<br />lower interest rates for the first time since<br />2020.","Joe Ornstein (95%): Jay Powell's speech at Jackson<br />Hole last week was an unambiguous signal that the<br />Fed Board of Governors plans to announce cut rates<br />at its September meeting. Futures markets on the<br />Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Fedwatch) suggest<br />that investors are only uncertain about *how<br />much* rates will be cut, not whether they will be<br />cut. There is still an inflation report scheduled<br />to be released by BLS a few days before the Fed<br />meeting, so I'm allowing for the possibility that<br />an unexpectedly bad report causes the Fed to hold<br />off rate cuts until after the November election.","Ryan Foley (95%): Recently Jerome Powell implied<br />that a cut is rates is coming during a speech<br />at Jackson Hole. He stated, \"The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.\" This appears to be him<br />telling Americans that cuts are coming and chances<br />are they will be during this upcoming September<br />meeting.","Jessica armour (61%): Based on my math of how<br />economy stimulation has decreased from 2023-2024<br />and knowing that the economy needs stimulation<br />in order to thrive, and also based on the trends<br />of inflation rates it is not likely that the<br />inflation rates will continue to rise and will<br />rather decrease even if by a minute amount in<br />order to ensure stimulation of the economy.","Abby Crowe (75%): I give it a 75% chance that<br />the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates at its<br />September meeting. I base this prediction almost<br />entirely on language presented by Jerome Powell,<br />the Chair of the Fed. Specifically this quote:<br />“The time has come for policy to adjust. The<br />direction of travel is clear, and the timing and<br />pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data,<br />the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,”<br />which he said in late August. He has hinted in the<br />past year at several cuts, and with the last two<br />meetings of the year approaching quickly, I think<br />there is a high likelihood of interest rate cuts<br />at the next meeting. Because I am in no place to<br />speak on markets and the fluctuation of interest<br />rates, I am leaning into expert opinions and<br />direct quotes to guide my forecast.","Hayden Morehouse (95%): I put 95% for this<br />question for mainly one reason, Federal Reserve<br />Chair Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole about<br />a week ago and he strongly hinted that the Fed<br />plans to cut rates. He said “The time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel<br />is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts<br />will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks,”. To me<br />this means that a rate cut is coming, they just<br />have not declared how much rates will be cut<br />by. This has been something that has been long<br />overdue in some peoples eyes and I am nearly<br />certain the announcment will come in September.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Haley Ford (95%): I am giving this such a high<br />probability because the word's out of Jerome<br />Powell's mouth himself, and the slew of articles<br />from WSJ, NYT etc. that verify that a rate cut<br />is expected, it is the amount that is a point of<br />speculation at the moment.","Colin Barry (75%): In recent weeks, speculation<br />over whether the FED will cut interest rates has<br />largely shifted from whether or not they will cut<br />them to, how much will they lower them by. This<br />follows Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair,<br />'s recent hint that changes will be coming soon<br />and that the direct of these changes has become<br />clear. This indicates that questions of when the<br />FED will cut rates will be answered, the only<br />question that remains is how soon. Many fixed<br />markets are fully preparing for the FED to cut<br />rates at its September meeting, as experts have<br />predicted following this hint. I expect that this<br />preparation indicates that there is around a 75%<br />chance that rates will be cut on September 18th.","Brooke McDermott (85%): It seems extremely likely<br />that the Fed will cut rates this September. The<br />Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has<br />said publicly that that's what the Fed intend to<br />do coming closer to the meeting. Inflation has<br />fallen significantly from our peak two years ago,<br />and is not far off from the Fed's target at 2.5%.<br />I think the next question is how much will the Fed<br />cut down, which seems to be the common denominator<br />amongst news outlets. Some Wall Street traders<br />are estimating that there is a 1/3 chance that<br />the Fed will cut by at least a half point, others<br />are saying a proposal of .25 over the span of the<br />next three meetings. I felt it may be best to stay<br />conservative in my prediction due to the fact that<br />the August unemployment rate will play a role in<br />how much the Fed cuts rates, in addition to other<br />factors. I think this pay pose a small risk to the<br />rates decreasing. Additionally, there is some risk<br />politically in that it would benefit the Harris<br />campaign greatly for us to see continued growth,<br />and the Trump campaign is extremely resistant to<br />rate cuts so close to the election.","Franco Bravo (75%): After having discussed with<br />several of my friends who are business, finance<br />and overall more in tune with this subject, they<br />are very confident that the Fed will lower rates.<br />One of my friends told me that they discussed this<br />in one of his classes and his professor told them<br />that he was almost positive that this infact will<br />happen.","Alexis Frazer (85%): The chairman of the feds<br />asserted a very strong message in his last remarks<br />that the interest rates will be taken down this<br />quarter. The primary debate surrounding interest<br />rates is less whether or not the reserve will<br />decrease interest rates, but rather by how much<br />they will decrease interest rates. Will it be a<br />quarter or half point reduction? I will be happy<br />with either, and am hoping this politician is<br />being truthful because it has been a decent amount<br />of time since interest rates were lowered and they<br />nearly promised an upcoming change.","Edward L Tsui (84.5%): I am hedging my<br />probability. I based my number on multiple<br />sources. According to CNBC and Fox Business, the<br />term trader used indicates traders think there<br />is a 100% chance of a FED rate cut. Other sources<br />indicate a 93.3% probability, and the 30 day FED<br />Future Rate with the CME group (at 4:50pm) show a<br />reduction in expected price of the future of 0.02%<br />in the future price, which is about a 25 to a 80<br />base point reduction in the overall interest rate.<br />According to the FED Watch as well, there is a<br />67.5% expectation of a target rate in September to<br />be between 500-525 base points (5-5.25% interest<br />rate) and a 37.5% expectation for 475-500 base<br />points. (4.75-5% interest rate) Both expectations<br />are lower than the current rate this week of 5.5%","Carson Ankeny (90%): I strongly believe that<br />the Fed will cut interest rates at the September<br />meeting. This is due to a variety of factors,<br />most importantly statements from the Fed Chairman<br />himself, as well as the pressing economic factors<br />that would cause the Fed to make that decision.<br />While there is a small chance that rates are<br />not lowered, most likely due to a conservative<br />and “safe” fiscal mindset that the Fed has<br />historically possessed under Chairman Powell, I<br />believe that the pressures on the Fed to act are<br />too great, and that there will be at least a small<br />decrease at the meeting on September 18th, leading<br />to incremental cuts at their remaining meetings<br />for the rest of the year.","Gracie Culpepper (75%): I'm putting mine very high<br />because based off of what the chairman said, I<br />really believe that they will lower the interest<br />rates. His last remarks seemed to hint that he was<br />interested in voting for them to go down, and most<br />websites I looked at were debating how much it<br />would drop by, not if it would drop at all.","Victor Avila (80%): I believe the FED will decide<br />to lower its rates at its September meeting with<br />an 80% probability. I came to these findings<br />through researching the history of the Federal<br />Interest Rates and how long they typically peak<br />and fall. Rates most recently peaked in August<br />2023 at 5.33. I then found a point in time with<br />similar rates and similar inflation (2.9). This<br />year was 2006. ⅘ similar scenarios have rates<br />peaking for about a year before the FED drops<br />rates. August 2024 makes a year that rates have<br />been steady at 5.33 as I anticipate them lowering<br />in September.","Corinne O'Dell (80%): Federal Reserve Chair Jerome<br />Powell strongly hinted that a cut is coming, and<br />many other financial analysists think the same.","Shayna Van Glish (75%): Given the current economic<br />conditions and the signals from the Federal<br />Reserve, I'd estimate the probability of the Fed<br />deciding to lower interest rates at its September<br />2024 meeting to be around 75%. This reflects a<br />strong likelihood, but not a certainty, as the Fed<br />remains cautious and data-dependent.","David Daniels (95%): This question has been nearly<br />answered prior to the date of the meeting. Federal<br />Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the<br />fed will likely make changes that lower interest<br />rates as indicated by his words, \"The time has<br />come for policy to adjust. The direction of<br />travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate<br />cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving<br />outlook, and the balance of risks.” Even without<br />this bombshell of information I would still be<br />in the 80-90 probability because of historical<br />baselines established with trends of inflation and<br />fed meetings.","John Mathis (90%): Well, unemployment has rose<br />to 4.3% when it was at a low of 1% last year,<br />according to McGregor McCance of University of<br />Virginia. Furthermore, according to the same<br />source, the Fed is satisfied with the 2% interest<br />rates it has recently achieved. So, because<br />interest rates are cooling and unemployment is<br />on the rise, it only makes sense for the Fed to<br />cut interest rates. All of this has led head of<br />the Fed Jerome Powell to say “the time has come<br />for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is<br />clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will<br />depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook,<br />and the balance of risks.” This, to me, hints<br />that the Chair of the Fed aims to cut interest<br />rates no matter what, but the size of those cuts<br />will depend on a lot of economic factors. While<br />Powell does not single-handedly decide the rate<br />adjustments, he is the head of the Federal Open<br />Market Committee, so I doubt he would say this<br />without certainty that the rest of the board will<br />back him up. Furthermore, more members of the<br />committee were seemingly open to cutting rates<br />back in July, and since pressure has only mounted<br />since then, I expect more and more members to be<br />on board with cutting rates. Given the historical<br />record of the Fed cutting interest rates with<br />rising unemployment and falling inflation rates<br />(historical record), as well as hearing it<br />straight from the mouth of the Fed Chair himself<br />(expert opinion), I can confidently say there is a<br />90% chance the Fed will cut rates in September.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (65%): After reading<br />articles and becoming slightly more informed on<br />the topic, a lot of experts have weighted in and<br />said that the feds will cut rates down by .25%. My<br />finance friend said that her professor explained<br />that probably won't happen because of the director<br />of the fed reserve, so I was slightly confused.<br />But after revising some of the information again<br />(and trusting my gut feeling which is probably not<br />a good idea) I'm going with 65.","Matthew Harvey (85%): There are a lot of factors<br />that are going into this decision. First and<br />foremost. The fed chair signals “Time Has Come”<br />for the September meeting. They are hinting at<br />cutting the interest rates on September the 18th.<br />The FOMC has also added in the previous July<br />meeting that all participants are supporting a<br />funds rate cut. Every news sources is saying that<br />the fed interest rate cut is highly likely. I<br />have hardly any doubt that this is going to occur.<br />https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/08/27/markets-firmly-expect-the-fed-to-cut-rates-on-september-18/","Vikram Bharadwaj (99%): It is clear to me that<br />with the market predicting with a virtually 100%<br />consensus that rates are going to be cut, that<br />this event is going to occur. Both Powell and<br />many other higher-ups in the Federal Reserve have<br />strongly hinted at rate cuts, and nearly every<br />graphic and estimation shows that now is the time<br />for rate cuts.","William Willis (95%): The fact that we have an<br />unemployment rate that is trending higher than<br />usual, our inflation rate is relatively high,<br />looking at the history shows that we will have a<br />cut. I found all of the unemployment rates from<br />the last 20 years, the inflation rate from the<br />last 20 years, and the fed rates for the last 20<br />years, and then when the rate cuts occurred. I<br />looked at them all side by side and found a trend<br />in the numbers. Each rate cut had a trend of high<br />unemployment rate and low inflation rate. I also<br />looked up information and found the Jerome Powell<br />stated that the “time has come to cut rates”, to<br />CNBC. There for which great certainty with what<br />the numbers are telling me I gave it a probability<br />of 95%.","Minha Ahmad (75%): I would say that the<br />probability is 75% due to several expert opinions.<br />Forbes, Reuters, and Fortune are just some among<br />many networks that have reported predictions that<br />there will be cuts.","Leo Zegarra (85%): The federal reserve chair,<br />Jerome Powell, has already given a speech on<br />what will occur. He made it clear that \"the<br />central bank was poised to cut interest rates in<br />September\" (New York Times). That was on August<br />23rd. However, he did claim on July 31st that \"the<br />market needs to stay [the way that it is].\" For<br />that reason, there is some doubt. Realistically,<br />however, with it being closer to the 09/17 and<br />09/18 meeting date and with Powell not only<br />saying there will be a cut but also discussing<br />specifically how much of a cut there will be, I am<br />leaning more towards yes.","Reece Slater (88%): I looked at personal<br />interviews and speeches given by Jerome Powell<br />which indicate almost certainty that the fed will<br />cut rates. I also looked at data by traders which<br />indicate close to a 100% chance that the fed<br />will cut rates by September. All sources that I<br />investigated are almost certain that the fed will<br />cut rates, the question is just a matter of how<br />much and what the impacts will be.","Alex Vrolijk (80%): Inflation has continued to<br />drop closer to the target 2% goal as the federal<br />interest rates remain high at over 5%. The fed<br />was already considering lowering interest rates<br />at their July meeting but decided not to. It has<br />been stated that a vast majority of Fed officials<br />believe a cut is likely in the upcoming meeting.","Findleigh Ague (79%): Interest rates have been<br />raised 11 times since March 2022 to counteract<br />inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee<br />meets several times throughout the year to discuss<br />different topics such as interest rates, but so<br />far, they have declined to lower them. Although<br />this is true, inflation is currently at the lowest<br />rate (2.9%) that it has been since March 2021.<br />Additionally, the Consumer Price Index has fallen<br />to 3%, which is reflective of lower inflation<br />rates, as on average, consumers are paying less.<br />When the CPI fell, the Fed projected that interest<br />rates would be cut to 5.1% by the end of the year.<br />Also, the CME FedWatch tracker predicts that at<br />the FOMC's September 17th and 18th meeting, there<br />is a 69.5% chance that interest rates will be cut<br />to 5-5.25%. For these reasons, I think that it is<br />pretty likely that interest rates will be cut at<br />their meeting in the next few weeks.","Simon Gersten (10%): If inflation is persistently<br />above the Fed’s 2% target, the Fed is unlikely to<br />lower rates. Inflation has been persistently above<br />the 2% target and appears to be continuing to do<br />so.","Oladipupo Fashogbon (80%): Inflation is all time<br />high so people do not want ot buy things. If they<br />lower the interest rates people would want to buy."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.38,0.46999999999999997,0.81000000000000005],"y":[2.9956199824810028,1.0480372193967924,2.0431242330931125],"text":["Crowd (38%)","Crowd (47%)","Crowd (81%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(TRUE,NA)","legendgroup":"(TRUE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will a Category IV (or<br />above) hurricane hit the<br />mainland US before Dec 1?","Will the US Federal<br />Reserve decide to lower<br />interest rates at its<br />September meeting?","Will UGA football be<br />undefeated in its regular<br />season?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will a Category IV (or<br />above) hurricane hit the<br />mainland US before Dec 1?","Will the US Federal<br />Reserve decide to lower<br />interest rates at its<br />September meeting?","Will UGA football be<br />undefeated in its regular<br />season?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"173040d46536":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"17303ab2530c":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"173040d46536","visdat":{"173040d46536":["function (y) ","x"],"17303ab2530c":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

It must also never join<br />NATO or develop nuclear weapons for a ceasefire<br />to be agreed to as well. These were extremely<br />unreasonable demands at the time, as Ukraine would<br />never agree to those requirements. As the year<br />progressed, Ukraine made advancements in Russia<br />in an attempt to push them towards a ceasefire.<br />Despite that, I don't see either country giving up<br />unless one side takes extremely heavy losses.","Erin Ho (35%): Honestly, this is a number I came<br />to after reading some of the reports and being<br />pessimistic. With Putin’s terms for a complete<br />ceasefire, it does not look very promising<br />considering it is asking for the complete<br />surrender of Ukrainian regions and Ukraine to<br />give up entering NATO. President Zelensky compared<br />it to Hitler’s actions in Czechoslovakia, and<br />it doesn’t look like Putin will accept any other<br />conditions. I wanted to make the percentage lower,<br />but I think this is a good number.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires only happen when<br />both sides believe they have more to gain from<br />peace than continued fighting. At the moment,<br />we're very far from that. Putin believes he can<br />wait out the resolve of Ukraine and its Western<br />supporters, and is unwilling to end the war<br />without guarantees that NATO will not expand into<br />Ukraine. And solid majorities of the Ukrainian<br />public express unwillingness to negotiate a<br />ceasefire that surrenders any land to Russia.<br />With nearly 1/5 of the country occupied and no<br />clear signs that that will change anytime soon,<br />Zelenskyy is facing no significant pressure to<br />pursue a ceasefire either. In the coming years,<br />both countries will find recruiting and retaining<br />military personnel more and more difficult, and<br />will eventually seek peace, but there is very<br />little chance of that in the next three months.","Minha Ahmad (40%): This summer, Putin made several<br />comments regarding a ceasefire, however, he was<br />also demanding that Ukraine handed over certain<br />regions. It seems that Russia will be more adamant<br />in regards to their demands, and I do not see a<br />ceasefire agreement occurring by December 1st.","Abby Crowe (5%): I only give a 5% chance that<br />Russia and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire<br />before December 1st. I am basing this prediction<br />on both the unwillingness to compromise from<br />Russia and the resolve that Ukraine has shown<br />since the war broke out. Additionally, Russia is<br />a veto member of the UN Security Council, and will<br />strike down any proposed ceasefire resolutions<br />that do not benefit Russia. They are pitted<br />against the rest of the permanent 5 member on the<br />council who are supporting Ukraine, and therefore<br />one of the most common pathways to ceasefire in<br />history is at a complete standstill. Additionally,<br />Ukraine has launched a counter-offensive, proving<br />their will and ability to stay at war for the<br />time being. Considering all these factors,<br />the probability of a ceasefire anytime soon is<br />extremely low.","Simon Gersten (10%): Explanation in brief.<br />Basically, Russia making gains, Ukraine backed by<br />countries that will not let it fall. Don't fight<br />the Russians in winter.","Hayden Morehouse (26%): This is a conflict that<br />has been going on since 2022 now. After some<br />research it seems that Putin would like to reach<br />a ceasefire instead of just a pause with Ukraine.<br />However, he challenges the legitimacy of Ukraine<br />as a state. This war is very expensive and violent<br />for both sides. However these things can drag on<br />without reaching a formal ceasefire that’s why I<br />am keeping my prediction low.","Jessica armour (33%): Based on recent news<br />articles of speakers for Ukraine stating that<br />they plan on indefinitely holding the territory in<br />Russia, I would say it is very unlikely that this<br />territory is given up before December 1, which is<br />the only condition Putin had for ceasefire. Also<br />based on the amount of time that has passed since<br />this conflict has started and the limited amount<br />of success either has had on ceasefire I would<br />say this event yields a 33 in probability for it<br />occurring, as more than likely it will not.","Liv Payne (15%): After extended research on the<br />topic, it seems highly unlikely that Russia or<br />Ukraine would agree to a ceasefire. Putin has<br />made \"an attempt\" at negotations, but Zelensky<br />will accept nothing less than complete withdrawal.<br />However, as the US election nears, we will know<br />more. The removal of US troops (which is likely<br />to occur if Trump wins) seems to guarantee a<br />Ukrainian defeat, whereas if Ukraine is permitted<br />into NATO, Russia would be quickly overwhelmed by<br />other forces. In either case, it seems unlikely<br />for things to change before December 1st, as many<br />predict the war continuing into early 2025.","Gracie Culpepper (17%): Ultimately, the<br />probability number that I am deciding to lock<br />in for this question is 17%. This is a very low<br />number, but my first reason for this is that both<br />leaders of these countries are very determined<br />to get the results they want. Neither of these<br />people want to lose the trust of their citizens,<br />and I think that is playing a big role in the<br />continuation of this war. Another reason is that<br />just this past May people thought a ceasefire<br />would occur and it never did. Both of these<br />countries have such a deep history with each other<br />and have a severe amount of nationalistic pride,<br />that I just don’t see a ceasefire occurring before<br />December 1st being that probable.","Vikram Bharadwaj (35%): At the center of this war<br />is the Donbas region of Ukraine. With the Russian<br />proposed ceasefire from June 15th was completely<br />rejected by Kyiv due to how obscene it is when<br />it regards the Donbas region and Crimea. And with<br />the recent drone strike, I doubt that a ceasefire<br />is on the minds of Ukrainians right now. However<br />given the possibility of the US pulling support<br />for Ukraine, there is still a significantly<br />possible chance that there would be a ceasefire<br />agreement.","Alexis Frazer (10%): The conflict between Russia<br />and Ukraine has been ongoing since early 2014. In<br />a speech on 14 June 2024, Putin outlined Russia's<br />terms for a ceasefire. He said that Russia would<br />not negotiate unless Ukraine handed over the<br />provinces of Ukraine claimed by Russia, including<br />the parts Russia does not control. It seems<br />extremely unlikely for Ukraine to back down now<br />especially with the assistance from the US.","Shayna Van Glish (25%): I think that there is a<br />25% likelihood that Russia and Ukraine will agree<br />to a ceasefire before Dec 1 because unexpected<br />diplomatic breakthroughs or changes in military<br />dynamics could occur, but there are significant<br />challenges that make a ceasefire unlikely in the<br />immediate future.","Corinne O'Dell (25%): I think the polarization<br />between the two countries is too strong and there<br />is too much deep history for a ceasefire in the<br />next coming months.","Haley Ford (10%): It does not seem likely that<br />this would occur-Russia gave Ukraine an ultimatum<br />that Ukraine viewed as “Hitler-like” per Zelensky,<br />who in turn will not negotiate until Russian<br />forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including<br />Crimea. Thus, after approaching about day 1000 of<br />war, a ceasefire agreement seems unlikely still.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (25%): At first, whenever<br />you look up \"will Russia and Ukraine agree<br />to a ceasefire,\" Microsoft Bing says yes. But<br />when you look at the article being cited, it is<br />from 2021. This sort of resonates with what the<br />reading for this week said. After reading some<br />sources, a ceasefire would be a smart move for<br />Russia, as public support for the war in Russia<br />has decreased significantly, and Putin tends to<br />care about support ratings. However, in order<br />for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, they request<br />Ukraine to withdraw from the 4 regions Russia<br />claims and to drop aspirations to join NATO. These<br />are requests that Ukraine will probably not agree<br />on. Recently, Ukraine launched an incursion which<br />was (obviously) not received well by Russia. But,<br />Ukraine is using this as an opportunity to force<br />Russia to come back into a peace talk. If the<br />West gets too involved, by sending military aid or<br />weapons of any kind, or attempts to join the peace<br />talks discussions, Russia will not agree. TLDR:<br />At the end of the day, I think that a ceasefire<br />before December 1 is unlikely.","Brooke McDermott (24%): I was looking at the<br />current status of the news on Ukraine and Russia,<br />and Russia most recently has seemed resistant to<br />peace talks due to wanting to maintain control<br />of intercepted Ukrainian lands. Additionally,<br />just today Russia bombed Ukraine and killed 51<br />individuals and wounded over 100. Just recently,<br />Putin just announced that Russia's nuclear<br />weapons policy is bound to change, insinuating<br />that Russian forces do not plan on submitting<br />anytime soon. Historically, some Ukrainian news<br />sources and analysts predicted, based on studies<br />of military conflicts over the last two centuries,<br />that the war would be roughly 7-8 months.","John Mathis (15%): I think that Russia and Ukraine<br />have shown no signs of being open to making a<br />peace deal and I doubt that will change anytime<br />soon, since according to Al-jazeera, Ukraine<br />demands that all previously seized territories<br />including the lands from the 2014 Crimea<br />invasion. Furthermore, Russia has started to make<br />more grounds in Ukraine after the end of their<br />counterattack, and unless Putin is completely<br />ousted from power, which seems unlikely given<br />his ties with China and control of the oligarchs.<br />Overall, given the small chance that putin is<br />ousted and the war ends, I give it about a 15%<br />chance.","Colin Barry (15%): I think the chances of a<br />ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine are low at<br />around a 15% chance. This is because of Putin's<br />statements this year that he would only agree to<br />a ceasefire that respects the current land changes<br />after the last couple years of conflict. I don't<br />think this is a deal that a U.S. backed Ukraine<br />would be willing to accept, and would instead seek<br />out a return of all the land lost in the conflict.","William Willis (42%): I came up with this number<br />because I talked to a marine this summer who had<br />a friend who lived in Ukraine and he said that he<br />doesn't see the war stopping anytime soon. He said<br />that the Ukraine economy is propped up on the War.<br />As long as the US keeps sending supplies the war<br />will continue.","David Daniels (35%): This question, in particular,<br />has been challenging for me. I've consulted with<br />several self-proclaimed 'international conflict<br />experts,' and they all seem to agree on one thing:<br />nothing significant will happen until the USA<br />takes decisive action. From what I've read and<br />heard, Putin will likely test his limits until<br />this election season concludes and the political<br />landscape becomes clearer. Given that the current<br />political leadership appears weak, I doubt any<br />steps will be taken toward a ceasefire. My main<br />concern, however, is the territory Ukraine has<br />seized in Russia. Although this occupation is<br />relatively small compared to Russia's hold on<br />Ukrainian land, it might still exert pressure on<br />Putin from his oligarchs. This is why I estimate<br />the probability at 35%.","Leo Zegarra (10%): I gave a really low probability<br />due to both sides having strong, conflicting<br />goals and continuing to engage heavily in the<br />conflict without finding any real middle ground<br />whatsoever. Russia is determined to maintain<br />control over certain territories and keep its<br />influence in Ukraine, while Ukraine insists on<br />a full withdrawal of Russian troops and will<br />not leave the territories that Putin wants them<br />to exit. Even though there is pressure from the<br />international community to end the fighting, and<br />both sides are feeling the strain of war, they<br />each believe they still have something to gain by<br />continuing. Without a clear military a big change<br />in strategy, a ceasefire is not likely anytime<br />soon, especially within 2 months.","Findleigh Ague (23%): Based on what I've read<br />on the current state of relations between Russia<br />and Ukraine, it does not seem that Putin nor<br />Zelenskyy are ready to meet each other's terms to<br />come to a ceasefire. Putin's demands would require<br />Ukraine to give up too much of their sovereignty,<br />which is an ultimatum that they are not willing<br />to fulfill. Right before the 2024 Ukraine Peace<br />Summit was held, Putin released a statement saying<br />that Russia would ceasefire once Ukrainian troops<br />are removed from the four territories that they<br />perviously annexed and abandon all plans to join<br />NATO. Zelenskyy obviously is not willing to do<br />something as this, as he compared these words and<br />actions to those of Hitler. For these reasons, I<br />don't see that it is very likely that both Russia<br />and Ukraine will agree to a ceasefire before<br />December 1st.","Abigail Harris (10%): Russia is demanding<br />significant land claim acknowledgment from<br />Ukraine. Ukraine wants full recognition of its<br />borders. The larger international community<br />doesn't want to anger Russia as far as the P5 is<br />concerned. The UN is useless because Russia has<br />veto power. I believe we've reached a familiar<br />precedent as far as Russia and other former Soviet<br />states are concerned. America and France are happy<br />to continue monetarily supporting Ukraine against<br />their former foe, but the reality is that Ukraine<br />is not in a position to be making demands, and<br />Russia has to think about the larger optics and<br />the desire for actually usable land and people<br />to labor on it. I would rather have money if I<br />pulled a single red ball out of a hat with nine<br />green balls than if Russia and Ukraine reached<br />a ceasefire. The ten percent is really only<br />there if the US somehow camp davids the two in<br />a never before seen stroke of post 2020 American<br />government competency.","Reece Slater (18%): I compiled speeches and<br />interviews from both Putin and Zelensky as well<br />as opinions from experts regarding the conflict.<br />I think this conflict will last well into 2025.<br />It is important to consider the motives of these<br />two leaders, especially Putin who is leading<br />the offensive. I don't think they will have an<br />incentive to negotiate a ceasefire until their<br />army cannot produce the arms at a quick enough<br />rate to continue. This is beginning to happen, but<br />I do not think it will happen before Dec 1.","Victor Avila (5%): Russia recently struck a<br />Ukrainian hospital and military academy killing<br />50 and wounding over 200. Zelensky also stated<br />that Ukraine will be holding onto the Kursk region<br />in Russia for the time being. That being said, I<br />think its best to bet against a ceasefire before<br />the date, considering the lack of progress thats<br />been made.","Matthew Harvey (25%): I believe that a great<br />deal leading into my percentage arrived from<br />events that occurred on September 3rd. Russia<br />shot 2 ballistic missiles into Ukraine and had<br />a confirm kill rate of 46 people. These weren't<br />military officers but rather civilians. I believe<br />that chances of a cease-fire went up in smoke<br />after such a strike. There might have been higher<br />chances before, however this attack is all but<br />going to stir up more conflict. This is also<br />based upon Ukraine not wanting to give up Russian<br />territory they have claimed. Both sides are not<br />willing to do things that would lead to eventual<br />peace talks.","Rommy Etzion (22%): All partial-ceasefire<br />negotiations in the past have either failed<br />largely (humanitarian corridor) or momentarily<br />worked and quickly fell. Russian previous<br />conditions involved maximalist demands with little<br />concession. The most recent negotiation regarding<br />energy facilities was derailed due to a surprise<br />inclusion by Ukraine, and because of that Russia<br />has vowed not to soften his position. Neither<br />state trusts each other, both have refused to<br />concede, and have yet to successfully discuss a<br />partial-ceasefire to specific sectors of the war.<br />A full ceasefire is even less likely. That being<br />said, military analysts have expressed skepticism<br />that Ukrainians forces can maintain control over<br />Russian territory, and concern on whether they<br />can survive this winter in Russian bombardment on<br />energy continued. This will raise the likelihood<br />of a ceasefire.","Sara Whitmire (5%): I don’t see a ceasefire<br />happening anytime soon. This conflict is seen<br />as one of the most devastating wars in Europe<br />since WWII, based on a deep, historical conflict<br />that can’t be solved within a few months.<br />Moreover, this war is ultimately decided by<br />Putin and Zelensky, two world leaders with crazy<br />personalities and citizens to represent. if Putin<br />ends the war, he looks weak, and if Zelensky ends<br />the war, the fight for Ukraine dies entirely. To<br />be frank, this war won’t end until one of them<br />dies. I didn't estimate 0% because there is a<br />potential for condemnation from the UN or some<br />other miracle. The fight to take back Ukraine<br />is an effort to re-assert Russia as a global<br />superpower on the world stage, and with the US<br />election, chances for a ceasefire on Putin's part<br />are low.","Jeffrey Markowitz (10%): Fighting has continued<br />and showed no signs of stopping. Putin has shown<br />that he will not cooperate with a ceasefire unless<br />Ukraine gives up incredible amounts of land.<br />Ceasefires have been in talks, but little progress<br />has been made.","Kira Liscombe (10%): In June of this year, Putin<br />spoke on a ceasefire and called on the Ukrainian<br />government to withdraw from four regions partially<br />occupied by Russia - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson,<br />and Zaporizhzhia. He also said Ukraine would need<br />to officially give up in its efforts to join the<br />NATO military alliance for the Russian advance<br />to be halted. Despite these former negotiations,<br />Ukraine seems unwilling to comply with Russia's<br />ultimatum. I found an expert opinion from Ruth<br />Deyermond, senior lecturer in the Department<br />of War Studies at King's College London RFE/RL<br />claiming, \"It's always dangerous to make<br />predictions, but it's difficult to imagine the war<br />ending by the end of 2024\". Based on all of this<br />information, and the lack of any recent news on<br />cease-fire negotiations between the countries, I<br />predicted a very low probability that we will see<br />any ceasefire before December.","Carson Ankeny (20%): I do not think there is a<br />very high chance for a ceasefire. While there have<br />been attempts to negotiate one, they have been<br />unsuccessful so far. Even as the international<br />community tries to place pressure on Russia,<br />neither side wants to come to the table, because<br />neither side is willing to make concessions.","Alex Vrolijk (20%): This is because Putin has said<br />that he will only agree to a ceasefire if Ukraine<br />hands over four regions and stops any aspirations<br />to join NATO. I see this as highly unlikely and<br />since the war has been ongoing for so long it is<br />hard to believe there will be a ceasefire soon<br />with the attitudes of the country's leaders.","Franco Bravo (50%): I went for 50% just because<br />from what I know in this topic, Putin is an<br />incredibly radical and unpredictable man.<br />Furthermore, Ukraine has been making several<br />military advances into mainland Russia which would<br />make it much more likely for there to be peace<br />talks. In my opinion there will be Peace talks in<br />the near future but I am unsure whether one will<br />happen by December First","Oladipupo Fashogbon (30%): To me, both sides<br />have shown little sign of willingness to agree<br />to a comprehensive ceasefire.

TIKTOK is under scrutiny with<br />congress but BYTEDANCE shows no clear signs of<br />selling, leaving me unsure about the selling<br />process. Hostorically no other company has sold or<br />been discussed in congress in the same light.","Ryan Foley (15%): When ByteDance was originally in<br />hot water with the US government they were adamant<br />on not selling. I feel like this feeling will<br />remain as they understand how valuable of an asset<br />TikTok is for the company. The algorithm behind<br />the app is crucial to its function and ByteDance<br />is set on keeping that first and foremost. The<br />company has also stated that they would rather<br />a shutdown in the US rather than selling. A<br />major complication as well is the outcome of the<br />November election as Trump has come out and said<br />that he will allow TikTok to continue being used<br />in the US. This makes it even less likely that the<br />company even has to sell in the first place.","Liv Payne (10%): All articles that I found were<br />from June 2024 or earlier, around the time when<br />the US government was making the decision to ban<br />TikTok. ByteDance was given the \"sell or ban\"<br />option, but have said that they will fight the<br />\"unconstitutional law\" in court. Also, if the ban<br />did go into effect, it would not be until 2025, as<br />they were given nine months from the decision to<br />sell. Therefore, I believe it highly unlikely that<br />they will sell.","Erin Ho (10%): Whenever the TikTok ban was first<br />passed in April of this year, ByteDance had<br />announced they had no intentions of selling their<br />platform to any US companies. Instead, they sued<br />the US government over the potential ban and will<br />challenge them over how constitutional this is.<br />I do not think ByteDance will sell, whether they<br />win, lose, or the case gets tossed out, because<br />TikTok is used everywhere else in the world and<br />is well-established as a social media platform.<br />I also believe that there is a benefit to having<br />a social media platform that is not controlled by<br />any US tech company.","Jessica armour (10%): ByteDance released a<br />statement earlier in the year that they have no<br />intentions of selling the platform TikTok, along<br />with this, since the \"sell or ban\" measure was<br />created there seems to be even more push back<br />when it comes to whether or not they will sell.<br />Along with this, taking into consideration the<br />vast amount of times the selling of TikTok has<br />been brought up and has never went through I would<br />say it is highly unlikely that ByteDance will<br />sell. TikTok generates too much money and is too<br />influential for the stakeholder to sell.","Abby Crowe (10%): I predict a 10% chance that<br />ByteDance will announce a deal before December<br />1st. I give a low chance because the company has<br />said directly that they have no plans to sell,<br />and are willing to challenge the US legislation in<br />the court system. Because of the timeline of our<br />courts, and their direct rejection of the idea of<br />selling, I find it highly unlikely that this event<br />will occur in the given timeline.","Haley Ford (20%): This forecasting challenge is<br />more difficult to interpret, however I think the<br />short timeframe makes it slightly easier. Court<br />proceedings could prolong any sale of TikTok and<br />thus I believe it has a low chance of being sold<br />before the December 1st deadline. Additionally,<br />the bill itself gave TikTok till January, which<br />I believe Bytedance would wait to the very end<br />if they were to sell. Thus, I believe there is a<br />20% likelihood of Bytedance selling TikTok before<br />December 1st.","Simon Gersten (10%): Given that Bytedance has<br />said they will not sell the app as the algorithm<br />is central to their business model, it is highly<br />unlikely they will sell the app by Dec. 1. It is<br />far more likely that they will continue to exhaust<br />all legal avenues which could take several years<br />in the courts.","Corinne O'Dell (20%): Given all of the factors<br />surrounding a sale of TikTok, the likelihood of<br />a sale by December 1, 2024 seems highly unlikely.<br />This is because of ByteDance’s continued legal<br />fights, the magnitude of the sale, and the<br />Chinese’s government's stake in the app. TikTok<br />is worth a valued 100 billion, so ByteDance has no<br />incentive to sell the app, as they could continue<br />making money even if the app shutdown in the US.<br />The situation remains dynamic, so there is still a<br />chance that the sale could happen within the next<br />few months. The timeframe is also too short for<br />them to be able to get through a legal battle by<br />Dec 1.","Reece Slater (16%): According to a statement<br />released by ByteDance earlier this year, they have<br />stated that they would rather have TikTok shutdown<br />in the United States than sell it. I also think<br />they are heavily relying on the courts to shut<br />this law down. TikTok is also a very hard entity<br />to dollar amount to and I think it will take a<br />long time to negotiate this even if they agree to<br />sell. Yes, they must sell it very soon in order<br />to avoid shutdown by law, but I don't think they<br />will.","Kira Liscombe (10%): According to the legislation<br />signed into law that bans TikTok unless sold to<br />a non-Chinese company, the sale deadline will<br />come sometime in 2025. This is after the winner<br />of the 2024 presidential election takes office,<br />which might have an impact on whether or not<br />the ban is implemented. Multiple media outlets<br />reported in April that ByteDance has no plans to<br />sell the platform, and it appears they have made<br />no statements saying otherwise since. Based on<br />this and the fact that Dec. 1 will come before the<br />final cutoff for the sale to occur, I predict a<br />very low probability that ByteDance will announce<br />any deal to sell TikTok.","Vikram Bharadwaj (15%): If this question was<br />asking whether or not Tiktok would be BANNED<br />in the US, there would be an entirely different<br />outlook on this question. However, the base<br />question of whether it will be sold is entirely<br />easier to answer. First off, based on the lack of<br />international precedent, no US law could force an<br />MNC to just be sold, especially when it concerns<br />such a strong international power in China.<br />With a massive decrease in public care for this<br />TikTok ban, it is becoming abundantly clear that<br />Bytedance will not only not sell TikTok, but will<br />likely not even be banned in the US. Financially<br />it doesn't make sense for them to sell this<br />platform when it is in the strongest growth period<br />ever, and frankly there is real chance they will.","Shayna Van Glish (15%): I think that there is a<br />15% chance that there is a deal to sell TikTok,<br />as it does not seem likely that ByteDance will<br />announce before Dec 1. The company has been<br />consistently resistant to selling TikTok and might<br />even prefer shutting it down rather than selling.","Jeffrey Markowitz (25%): There are multiple<br />articles discussing Bitedance would rather shut<br />down tiktok than sell it in december. There have<br />been no updates since.","Brooke McDermott (16%): TikTok representatives and<br />Bytedance representatives have been very resistant<br />to the push that the U.S. government has been<br />pressing on them to sell or they will be banned<br />in the U.S. In addition to this, they are in an<br />on-going legal battle that discusses the first<br />amendment rights of the company in terms of their<br />censorship, and there has been many discussions<br />about data and Chinese involvement. Bytedance made<br />strong claims that they will not sell in April,<br />and more recently have made various statements<br />about their constitutional rights and readmitting<br />their firm stance. Pew Research Center made a<br />study as recently as Sep. 5th that at least 50%<br />of Americans do not think the app will be banned,<br />and additionally, there is a consistent decline<br />in support of the TikTok ban since April. However,<br />the app does receive the most revenue from the<br />U.S. in comparison to other countries. This may<br />lead to some sort of deal in which they sell, but<br />I doubt that this would lead to a deal rather than<br />more time in suits.","Edward L Tsui (15%): Despite 16 billion revenue<br />from US markets, ByteDance, the parent company,<br />prefers a TikTok shutdown in the US if legal<br />options fail come January 25th, 2025 according<br />to Reuters. On April 23rd-24th, 2024 Congress<br />passed a bill to ban Tik Tok in the United States;<br />President Biden then signed the bill. With over<br />30 states banning the app on government devices,<br />and the app being banned by the US military and<br />its members, hope does not look good for the<br />Chinese-owned company. I do not think the US will<br />be successful in a forced sell by December 1st.","Colin Barry (30%): I would say that Bytedance<br />agreeing to a deal to sell TikTok by December 1st<br />would be unlikely, as the company stated in April<br />that they had no plans to sell. This is because<br />the source algorithm the app runs on is allegedly<br />vital to the function of their company, which has<br />made them hesitant to part ways with it. I also do<br />not think that a deal would be made until sooner<br />to the deadline for them to sell, which falls<br />on January 19th. This is almost two months after<br />the December 1st deadline for our forecasting<br />question.","Alexis Frazer (15%): While Biden did sign a law in<br />April of 2024 saying Tiktok will be banned if not<br />sold, there has been little to no indication of<br />urgent plans ByteDance has to sell the app. There<br />is still possibility for it to happen which is why<br />I choose 15%.","Gracie Culpepper (20%): I'm saying 20 because<br />based off of what I read I just don't think it<br />will be super probable. I also think that the<br />election and how TikTok has been in US politics<br />for a minute now will have some affect over this<br />and I just don't think it is super likely.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): ByteDance has explicitly<br />stated their will to not divest from Tik Tok by<br />the January 2025 deadline. Despite the Tik Tok and<br />Fortnite App on the Apple Store being different<br />scenarios, I believe that ByteDance will continue<br />to stand firm despite pressures. ByteDance is also<br />taking this ban decision through the court system.<br />Tik Tok and the DOJ asked for a ruling by Dec. 6<br />meaning the ban could be overturned or confirmed<br />passed the Dec. 1 deadline for this forecast. With<br />the hope of a possible ban overturn by SCOTUS, I<br />do not think ByteDance will change its stance on<br />divestment until the court's ruling.","David Daniels (15%): I don’t think ByteDance will<br />sell TikTok before December 1st because they seem<br />more focused on fighting the U.S. government’s<br />demands rather than selling. They’ve got until<br />January 2025 to either sell or face a ban, so<br />the urgency isn’t immediate. Selling TikTok<br />without its core algorithm is also a headache,<br />and ByteDance isn't eager to give competitors<br />that advantage. The platform makes most of its<br />money outside the U.S., which lowers the pressure.<br />I’d put the odds of a sale happening by December<br />1st at just 15%. This probability of mine is<br />also supported by the notion that ByteDance has<br />outright declared they would rather be banned<br />then sell their controlling interest. My only<br />reluctancy regarding this is rumors of backroom<br />negotiations between American interests and<br />ByteDance.","Findleigh Ague (24%): ByteDance seems pretty<br />adamant that they will not be selling TikTok<br />to a U.S. company. The algorithm that TikTok<br />operates on is crucial to how the app is able to<br />generate revenue and provide for its users, so<br />selling the app to a company that would change<br />its functionality in order to stop storing data<br />and protect Americans’ privacy would completely<br />change how the app works. For this reason, in<br />the case that they haven’t come to any sort of<br />agreement, they wouldn’t want to keep the app and<br />have to change this algorithm in order to keep<br />American customers because they don’t account<br />for that large of a share of their revenue and<br />users anyway. They would rather just let the<br />app be banned in the U.S. because it wouldn’t<br />leave a huge impact on the company. I think that<br />if anything, they might come to some sort of<br />agreement, but I don’t think that they will be<br />selling the app, especially not by December 1st,<br />as they have until January 19th to sell.","Kristalee Gonzalez-Perez (10%): If we are talking<br />about ByteDance announcing to sell TikTok to<br />the US, I am confident that this probably won't<br />happen. ByteDance has said, \"ByteDance doesn't<br />have any plans to sell TikTok.\" That is what gives<br />me confidence. But then again, I do not want to<br />be over confident, so I looked into ByteDance's<br />blog (useless). I also read an NYT article about<br />it. This article gave me a more solid background<br />of why the sale is unlikely rather than only<br />ByteDance's statement. According to the article,<br />if ByteDance were to sell TikTok, companies<br />like Google or Microsoft would be able to afford<br />it, but they are likely to run into antitrust<br />concerns. I think that a global sale of TikTok<br />might be more likely than an US sale.","Hayden Morehouse (15%): According to the research<br />I did ByteDance has no intention of selling the<br />app. These legal proceedings can take a very long<br />time and they do not want to give up what is maybe<br />the most popular social media app available. I<br />just don’t see it happening any time soon.","Leo Zegarra (20%): Because the \"deadline\" to<br />sell TikTok is after December 1st, I truly<br />don't believe ByteDance will announce a deal to<br />sell TikTok before December 1. This is because<br />ByteDance has consistently resisted selling<br />TikTok, showing their dedication towards leaving<br />it be and not really abiding by anyone else's<br />demands. Although the U.S. has put serious<br />pressure for a sale, it also isn;t until some<br />time in January, making it less likely to happen<br />since they would have a a month or so more to<br />arrange for that to occur. Additionally, the<br />geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China<br />add complexity, making it difficult to reach a<br />deal that satisfies all parties involved. Thus the<br />reason for my 20% probability.","Wiliam Willis (33%): I selected 33% probability<br />for this because I don't think it can happen<br />because the purchase makes no sense for your<br />business model or it makes too much sense to be<br />legal. Tik Tok has continued to make revisions to<br />their privacy policy. I believe that this shows<br />that they are motivated to keep the app appealing<br />to Americans. I came up with the number 33%<br />because I don't think that a decision could be<br />made by December 1. I think that the presidential<br />election will play into this and will not be dealt<br />with until afterward. Also the owner of ByteDance<br />said in April that he denies it's willing to sell<br />Tik Tok as US ban looms.","Rommy Etzion (40%): It is not unlikely that they<br />will sell, but I believe it to be more likely<br />that they will refuse and take it to the court.<br />While there are millions of users in the US,<br />TikTok is extremely popular worldwide. They will<br />challenge the ban in court, and if lose they may<br />want to keep their company and accept the US ban<br />on selling. Additionally, President Biden set a<br />January 19th deadline for the sale, right when<br />Bidens presidential term ends. I do not believe<br />that ByteDance will sell Tiktok a month before<br />that deadline, and I don’t believe the United<br />States will place much pressure on them to do so<br />during the height of the election leading up to<br />that deadline.","Abigail Harris (40%): Bytedance has repeatedly<br />claimed they would rather shut down tiktok than<br />sell it to a U.S. owned company. Also, the current<br />wording that Biden signed into law as part of<br />an emergency foreign aid relief package doesn't<br />come into effect until January 19th 2025, giving<br />ByteDance plenty of time to challenge the law<br />on first amendment grounds like they're claiming<br />they want to do or sell Tiktok later on after<br />December. I also don't think this is something<br />the US is going to push in the immediate future<br />seeing as how more than 60% of their stock is<br />internationally owned and in part by Blackrock<br />investing. So it's not like the CIA isn't eating<br />their cake anyway here.","Minha Ahmad (10%): There is a very low possibility<br />that ByteDance will sell TikTok by December 1st.<br />There have been several reports and articles since<br />April of 2024 stating that ByteDance has no plans<br />to sell, and would rather shut down TikTok in the<br />U.S. if required to than sell their company.","John Mathis (15%): ByteDance has made it<br />abundantly clear that they will not sell tiktok.<br />Additionally, The US isn't even the largest user<br />base for tiktok, and it makes up only a fraction<br />of their total downloads. Additionally, 80% of<br />their sales on the Tiktok Shop come from southeast<br />asia, meaning the US market will not impact the<br />sales of Tiktok as much as people may believe.<br />Given this information, I doubt tiktok will sell<br />before Dec. 1","Victor Avila (30%): In April of 2024, Joe Biden<br />announced that Bytedance has 270 days to sell its<br />recently-emerging, hit social media app, Tik Tok<br />due to the scares of the Chinese government being<br />able to access user-sensitive data. If Bytedance<br />does not sell the app, it will be banned in the<br />United States. Recently Bytedance stated that<br />is does not intend to sell Tiktok especially<br />considering the app reached $16.1 billion dollars<br />in annual revenue. Also, due to tension between<br />China and the United States escalating I do not<br />foresee any leniency for the company when the time<br />comes.","Franco Bravo (25%): Due to the complex<br />geopolitical nature of this deal, I believe<br />that it is highly unlikely that Byte dance will<br />announce a sale by December 1. I do not think that<br />Bytedance will fold to the political pressures of<br />the US government. Additionally, the criticisms<br />that the public has shown has made it even more<br />difficult. iF there is any sale, then I believe it<br />will be postponed and not be announced by December<br />first.","Joe Ornstein (3%): Anonymous sources within<br />ByteDance have communicated that the company would<br />rather shut down TikTok than sell it. TikTok a<br />relatively small share of ByteDance's revenues.<br />Selling TikTok, and, presumably, its algorithm,<br />would endanger its revenues to a much greater<br />extent than just shutting down its US operations.<br />The company is unlikely to pursue a deal prior to<br />the November election, on the theory that Trump<br />would work to reverse (or not enforce) the law if<br />re-elected. And if Harris is elected, 25 days is<br />very little time to negotiate and agree to a sale.<br />Furthermore, there is ongoing litigation, and a<br />judge could rule against the law on 1st Amendment<br />grounds, further delaying a resolution.","Carson Ankeny (10%): Due to public statements that<br />the company would rather be forced to shutdown<br />in the US than be forced to make a sale, I think<br />it is highly unlikely that they sell. Company<br />leadership has been very adamant that a sale will<br />not happen, and for that reason I am not confident<br />that there would be a sale. Their algorithm is too<br />important for them to be willing to sell.","Jessica armour (25%): Throughout all the trends<br />of deaths caused by COVID-19 there has yet to be<br />a week with 3,000 deaths in over a year. The most<br />recent weeks have had less than 1,000 deaths.<br />This leads me to believe that although possible it<br />is very unlikely that the weekly death rate will<br />reach 3,000 by Dec 1. With that being said, there<br />has been an uptick in the amount of COVID cases<br />within the past few months, so the probability is<br />not 0, yet it is still highly unlikely to occur.","Erin Ho (30%): Based on some recent articles and<br />reviewing the past weeks of weekly COVID-19 death<br />rates, I don’t think it’ll reach above 3,000.<br />I think it’ll get close, but not high enough.<br />There are still deaths happening, due to people<br />not getting the updated version of the vaccine<br />nor accessing available treatments for illness in<br />general. However, the last time we got close to<br />hitting 3,000 COVID-19 deaths was January 2024,<br />but since then it hasn’t gotten close at all.","Ryan Foley (15%): Currently, the weekly death rate<br />per 100 thousand people is 300.3. This rate covers<br />the last 3 months which is about the same amount<br />of time before the deadline for this question.<br />This means that the current rate would have the<br />10x before December 1st which is highly unlikely.<br />We have vaccines, better and more accurate<br />screening methods, and more people understand the<br />steps to take when the have Covid. Unless a new<br />mutation on the virus appears that is resistant to<br />the countermeasures we have developed, I don't see<br />a substantial increase in deaths occurring.","Brooke McDermott (18%): Studies show that the<br />death rates per week have been decreasing over<br />the years since vaccines have started to be<br />administered. That being said, there is a lot of<br />fluctuation between seasons and there tends to be<br />a huge peak in deaths around the end of December<br />and the start of January historically. With the<br />introduction of vaccines and other protocols since<br />the start of the pandemic, I believe that the<br />deaths will continue to decrease. That being said,<br />I felt like it was more likely to reach 3,000<br />given past data of spikes in the winter months.","Liv Payne (15%): I find unlikely that we will<br />experience a spike to 3000 deaths per week before<br />December 1st. Looking at CDC data, we can see a<br />trend of deaths decreasing over time. Our last<br />spike was in January of 2023, which was around<br />2500 deaths per week. However, that was following<br />a period of time where the deaths rose from 1400<br />in September. Currently, data is not available<br />for September 2024, so I used data from August to<br />make my prediction. As of August 31, 2.6% of COVID<br />cases resulted in death. In the past three months,<br />most states have had 100-199 deaths from COVID. In<br />the week before August 31, no states were over 8%<br />cases of death, and the majority range from 2-3.9%<br />to 1-9 counts. Therefore, I don't think that COVID<br />deaths will spike to 3000.","Simon Gersten (20%): With the increase in vaccine<br />availability accompanied with more prepared<br />medical units, the likelihood remains low that the<br />death count will reach over 3000 per week before<br />December 1st. While the colder months are likely<br />to increase the death count, it is unlikely that<br />it will go back up to 3000 per week.","Corinne O'Dell (8%): COVID-19 weekly death rates<br />in the United States are not expected to reach<br />3,000 or more per week before December 1, 2024,<br />based on current trends and expert projections.<br />According to the CDC, as of early September,<br />there are about 1,200-1,300 deaths per week​.<br />COVID deaths have been decreasing as time has<br />gone on, and in last December the weekly COVID-19<br />death toll in the U.S. varied, with early reports<br />indicating around 1,500 to 2,000 deaths per week.<br />This all indicates that the weekly rates will not<br />increase to 3,000 or above.","Findleigh Ague (62%): Based on data from both<br />the CDC and Our World in Data, it looks as though<br />COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. are still under 1000,<br />and they've been fluctuating around the 600-900s<br />since July 2024. The most recent data point they<br />have is as of August 31, 2024, there were 663<br />deaths that week. This past week, the percentage<br />of deaths related to COVID-19, was 2.6%. Also<br />this past week, the rate of COVID-19 related<br />deaths per 100,000 population (age-adjusted) was<br />0.2. Although this is true, I feel like it can be<br />pretty easy for the rates to rise to 3000. There<br />still isn't data from the week following Labor<br />Day weekend, so that along with the following<br />weeks could likely showcase an increase in<br />contaminations and then later on deaths because<br />of the increase in travel and gatherings of family<br />and friends. We have also seen nationally high<br />levels of COVID-19 in wastewater (8.82) going<br />into the school season. There was a peak during<br />the summer, but according to Andrea Garcia of the<br />American Medical Association, it's too early to<br />tell if this peak has truly passed. I think that<br />we will have to see how these next few weeks are<br />looking to make a more conclusive statement about<br />this, but regardless, I think it is relatively<br />likely that deaths will rise to 3000 since we<br />know that the virus spreads easily and quickly and<br />does so even more to those with compromised immune<br />systems.","Haley Ford (2%): I put 2/100 mainly based off the<br />weekly data provided by the CDC. The number of<br />COVID cases seem to increase in cooler months,<br />however last December the death count was about<br />1700 dated on December 2nd. (closet data point<br />to the 1st) In January, cases increased but still<br />remained under the 3,000 threshold, maxing out<br />at 2,578 on January 13. Given our forecast ends<br />before December begins, I feel more comfortable<br />putting a lower probability on this forecast.<br />Additionally, this years end of August is below<br />last years.","Gracie Culpepper (5%): I really think this is<br />unlikely. Last year the World Health Organization<br />reported that it was under 3k around this time<br />last year up until the end of 2023 in December.<br />Even throughout this entire year, so far the<br />maximum weekly death rate has not risen above<br />2.8k. I really think this is incredibly unlikely.","Hayden Morehouse (30%): I had a hard time finding<br />research for this but last year the totals did not<br />reach this point so I am going to make an estimate<br />based on those numbers since those would be the<br />most representative for this upcoming year.","Abby Crowe (20%): I predict a 20% chance that<br />COVID-19 weekly death rates in the US reach 3,000<br />or above before Dec 1. The last time covid deaths<br />spiked over 3,000 in one week was in March of<br />2023, over 1.5 years back from now. While covid<br />deaths are spiking because of flu season and time<br />of year, I still find it unlikely that the spike<br />will be that high at any point before December.","Vikram Bharadwaj (25%): I give this prediction a<br />25% confidence rating as compared to the previous<br />year, the number of deaths are down significantly,<br />however with the elections coming up and the<br />potential for many super-spreader like events,<br />there is a real chance that it could break into<br />the 3000s by December 1st. However the main reason<br />for the lack of confidence is the general data<br />trends and lack of a major factor (other than the<br />election) that would cause such a high spike in<br />deaths. If we look back to last year, we failed<br />to even break 3000 until January of this year,<br />much later in the heavy holiday travel season<br />than would be required for this event to come to<br />fruition.","William Willis (23%): I believe that there is a<br />23% chance that the weekly death rate from Covid<br />19 will exceed 3,000. I have reason to believe<br />this because I looked at the death rates per the<br />last 3 years. The last time it was at 3,000 was<br />1/21/23. My reason for selecting this number was<br />because this week is less than it was last year.<br />You catch covid from other people, so the less<br />people that have it, the less chances you have of<br />catching it. If this month is lower than last year<br />that could mean that fewer people could catch it<br />per month than previous years.","Kira Liscombe (12%): According to data I<br />found from the CDC, in late December of 2023<br />provisional COVID death counts by week in the<br />US reached 2,229. More recently in August of<br />2024, provisional COVID death counts by week<br />in the US only reached 663. Trends in United<br />States COVID-19 Deaths show spikes around every<br />late December/early January, but they have been<br />consistently shrinking each year. Additionally,<br />NBC reported that the Food and Drug Administration<br />has been following a routine similar to how the<br />annual flu shot is updated in administering the<br />COVID vaccine. With the presecense of a vaccine<br />this year, and overall low case trends seen in the<br />last two years, I predict a low probability that<br />the COVID-19 weekly death rate will reach 3,000<br />before Dec. 1.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): Weekly death rates have<br />been hovering around 700 for the past few weeks<br />now. There is no reason that should change in the<br />coming months.","Edward Tsui (30%): I think COVID-19 weekly death<br />rates in the United States have a chance to reach<br />3,000 before December 1st. According to the CDC,<br />overall COVID rates have downward trended. Covid<br />tends to soar in the December and colder months<br />of winter. However, I've noticed, that since the<br />pandemic, the rates of August tend to double in<br />the winter. Presently, I don't think the doubling<br />of August 2024 would reach 3,000. New York Times<br />report similar numbers. Overall, I think it's<br />a 50-50, but less than that, so I split the<br />difference and then some.","Shayna Van Glish (7%): I think that is it really<br />unlikely that the COVID-19 weekly death rates in<br />the US will exceed 3,000, as currently the rates<br />are only around 500. While it can increase with<br />flu season approaching, preventative measures will<br />keep it from reaching high levels. There also is<br />the added factor that there is widespread immunity<br />to COVID-19 from vaccinations and prior infection.","Colin Barry (40%): I think that it is about<br />an even chance but am leaning more towards it<br />being less than likely. This is because based on<br />previous years' trends where covid deaths reach<br />their weekly highs in the months following our<br />December1st deadline. However, I do think the<br />chance is as high as 40% since there is a much<br />stronger wave of covid hitting the U.S. currently<br />than there has been in these previously measured<br />years.","David Daniels (2%): I believe the weekly COVID-19<br />death rate in the U.S. will not reach 3,000 before<br />December 1, 2024, assigning a 2% chance. This<br />assessment is based on the observed downtrend in<br />COVID-19 deaths and the fact that monthly death<br />rates rarely exceed 3,000 let a lone weekly.<br />According to CDC data, the downward trend in<br />deaths supports this outlook, and that is why I am<br />confident with my 2% assigned probability.","Matthew Harvey (30%): I believe that there is<br />an unlikely chance that deaths will exceed 3000<br />before December the 1st. While I believe that<br />as we approach fall and colder temperatures<br />and as we approach flu season, sickness will<br />spread faster, I do believe that it is a lot<br />less likely for people to die now from Covid-19.<br />With the production of the vaccine being able<br />to combat the virus and citizens being aware<br />of symptoms, I believe it helps contribute to<br />lessening the factors and severity of COVID-19. I<br />cannot exclude potentials of having outbreaks and<br />flair ups, as well as mutations and more deadly<br />strands to happen. As of right now, according to<br />ourworlddata.org, as of August 18th, there were<br />757 deaths a week. This is down from 883 two weeks<br />prior, I believe this will fluctuate around the<br />upper 100’s and maybe into the low 1000’s, however<br />I don’t believe it will exceed 3000.","John Mathis (40%): Simply put, cases rise during<br />winter and I believe that Covid has reached a<br />flu-like status where a certain amount of people<br />will die from it every year. However, I do not<br />think it will rise enough to pass 3k deaths, as<br />last year it did not and they had a higher death<br />toll going into winter than we do now. It will<br />be close however, so I am putting 40 to hedge my<br />bets.","Leo Zegarra (0%): It is clear and obvious<br />that Shogun is the heavy favorites. Although I<br />have not watched any of the shows, practically<br />all the rankings for each series shows 3 Body<br />Problem being ranked last. So, given that they're<br />predicted to be last of 8, it shows that the<br />ranking sites are putting a massive 7 shows above<br />this series. It seems virtually impossible for<br />the show to actually win. Plus, they have a +1600<br />betting odds to win, the highest out of all the<br />shows. I will give my first 0% probability that<br />this will happen.","Oladipupo fashogbon (35%): I took the derivative<br />of the provisional deaths given by the cdc<br />records. I saw based on the most recent data, it<br />shows fluctuations between +36.8% (on 8/24/2024)<br />and -18.3% (on 7/20/2024)., therefore this was<br />abasis for my data.","Victor Avila (40%): I do not believe that weekly<br />deaths from COVID-19 will reach 3,000. It seems<br />as though that COVID is a lot more common during<br />the hotter times of the year, when the virus<br />thrives. Not to mention, it seems like the virus<br />has somewhat stabilized in the recent months and I<br />think it will likely decrease as we head into the<br />winter.","Abigail Harris (30%): We are currently . It's been<br />almost since January of 2023 when a new variant<br />was prevalent, and Covid is growing in 7 states<br />while declining in 16 states, including 3 of<br />the most populous, including California, Texas,<br />and NY. I also don't think Covid will be mass<br />reported or incentivized to be reported by this<br />administration again before the election and Covid<br />and viruses are less active in the winter overall.","Franco Bravo (25%): After having done some<br />research, from the looks of it there has been an<br />increase in COVID weekly rates in the last couple<br />months. However I believe that the rate and number<br />at which COVID is going up in will reach 3000 by<br />December unless something very drastic were to<br />happen","Carson Ankeny (15%): According to all of the CDC<br />data I have seen it seems highly unlikely that the<br />death rate would rise. Especially at this point<br />in the pandemic death rates have been steadily<br />declining and even with a \"school spike\" it<br />doesn't seem likely to reach 3k.","Alex Vrolijk (10%): The last time the weekly<br />death rate was above three thousand was in January<br />2023 and since that December the death rate has<br />not been near 3,000. Unless a new variant strain<br />arises, I think it is very unlikely for the<br />rate to reach above three thousand. Even with a<br />possible spike due to thanksgiving travel, I do<br />not believe it will spike because it did not this<br />past summer either (summer being a season with a<br />lot of traveling).","Joe Ornstein (5%): With such a large share of<br />the US population either vaccinated or previously<br />exposed to COVID-19, the size of the population<br />susceptible to severe illness or death is much<br />smaller than during the past four winters. For<br />death rates to reach this level, either the<br />virulence or case fatality rate would have to<br />increase dramatically compared to last winter<br />(when weekly death rates were less than half<br />that). Current estimates of R are less than<br />0.96, suggesting that at the moment case counts<br />are decreasing. While I expect that value to<br />increase in the coming months, it would require<br />an implausibly rapid increase to see death rates<br />above 3,000 before December 1.","Hayden Morehouse (5%): I don't know anything about<br />this show or much about the emmys so I went with<br />ole reliable and looked up the vegas betting odds.<br />They had this show at the lowest probability so<br />I am going to take a gamble and say this is not<br />going to happen.","Abby Crowe (10%): I predict a 10% chance that the<br />show “3 Body Problem” will win the Emmy. They are<br />competing against 7 other shows, several of which<br />have far more nominations and publicity. If the<br />question were broader about the show winning any<br />Emmy this year, I would be more generous, but with<br />the specificity of the question, I find it highly<br />unlikely.","Minha Ahmad (60%): I think it is highly likely<br />that the show will win the Emmy due to its past<br />success. It was the most-watched show on Netflix<br />at the end of March. The show has also been<br />nominated for six emmys this season.","Alexis Frazer (15%): Per CDC data and past trends,<br />in my briefing I cam eto the conclusion that it is<br />highly unprobable for COVID deaths to skyrocket in<br />the upcoming months before December 1st.","Ryan Foley (10%): A sci-fi show has never won<br />the Emmy for this category and there is too much<br />competition that beats 3 Body Problem this year.<br />Fallout and Shogun both have higher ratings and<br />are true to their source material. 3 Body Problem<br />on the other hand whitewashes its characters<br />and falls short of providing an accurate<br />representation of the story it draws from.","William Willis (8%): I read on Vanity fair that<br />the show Shōgun performed at the Creative Arts<br />Emmys and that you would be a fool not to predict<br />a win here. Apparently Shogun is dominating in<br />every category. I don't have any faith in 3 Body<br />problem and the reviews I saw online did not give<br />them the best rating.","Corinne O'Dell (10%): If you look at just the<br />numbers, there are 8 other shows nominated, which<br />puts it at a mathematical 12.5%. However, the<br />show has received many positive reviews. After<br />researching the category and looking at what the<br />experts are saying, the show Shōgun is the front<br />runner for the award, as it has been sweeping<br />everything else. That is why I have lowered my<br />prediction to 10%.","Edward Tsui (2.94%): The Vegas Insider betting<br />odds have \"3 Body Problem\" at +3300, which means<br />if I were to put a $100 bet on the show winning, I<br />would make my 100 back along with 3300. This high<br />payout, especially being a positive bet, means<br />the outcome is very unlikely. Using an implied<br />probability calculator, with ODDS/ (ODDS +100)<br />that equals 0.0294 or 2.94%. Using reviews online,<br />Shogun has the highest nominations and likelihood<br />to make it the winner. Furthermore, 3 Body Problem<br />is tied for dead last in ranking with The Gilded<br />Age out of list of 8 nominations for the Emmys.","Haley Ford (2%): Based on online discourse and<br />Gold Derby odds, Shogun is favored immensely.<br />Additionally, the odds in Gold Derby are<br />the lowest out of all the choices, and it is<br />more difficult for a new series to win this<br />award--although Shogun is new it seems to garner<br />much more support and was also nominated for many<br />categories across the board.","Jeffrey Markowitz (20%): Other shows have much<br />higher rotten tomatoes scores.","Brooke McDermott (10%): There are a lot of factors<br />pushing against their win. Primarily, there is<br />a much higher change that their competitor in<br />the category, Shogun, wins. It showed a lot of<br />success at the Creative Arts Emmys show, which<br />makes it kind of a shoe in to win on the 15th.<br />Additionally, the last few years, the Outstanding<br />Drama Series have typically gone to shows that<br />show interfamilial turmoil or issues within social<br />spheres, like Succession and Game of Thrones. I<br />think those who made the show have a really good<br />track record in writing and cinematography (in<br />terms of previous Emmy award and noms in said<br />categories) , but that was from their stints on<br />Game of Thrones.","Jessica armour (30%): The show currently has six<br />different nominations for an Emmy, however there<br />are several other shows which currently have 19+<br />Emmy nominations.Therefore, I think it is unlikely<br />that the show \"Three Body Problem\" will receive an<br />Emmy when it has a significantly lower portion of<br />nominations compared to other shows streaming on<br />Netflix.","Simon Gersten (10%): Shogun is the frontrunner and<br />has been nominated for 25 Emmys, making it highly<br />unlikely that 3 body problem will surpass it.","Vikram Bharadwaj (5%): When it comes to the<br />Emmy awards, especially for Dramas, there is a<br />clear trend with the committee heavily avoiding<br />Sci-Fi shows in general. With 3 body problem not<br />being the most especially well received shows<br />as compared to shows such as 将軍(Shōgun) which<br />is by and far the most likely to win the award.<br />Especially when we start to consider just how many<br />strong shows there are this year, 3 body problem<br />is such a huge outlier in how poorly received<br />it was by a large part of its fandom. Truly 3<br />body problem winning this award would be an act<br />of god wanting my brier score to get absolutely<br />destroyed.","Kira Liscombe (5%): I made the forecast that on<br />a scale of 0 to 100, there is a probability of 5<br />that the show \"3 Body Problem\" will win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding Drama Series on Sep 15. To<br />determine this, I compared \"3 Body Problem\" to its<br />top competitor, analyzing media predictions, other<br />awards/accreditations received by the series, and<br />the previous Outstanding Drama Series winner. I<br />explained this further in depth in my brief.","Liv Payne (20%): \"3 Body Problem\" has stiff<br />competition this year at the Emmy's. For one, \"The<br />Crown\" is up for the same award, and that series<br />has already received 21 Emmy's since 2016. Then<br />there is \"Shōgun\", which has broken the record for<br />the most wins in a single season at 14 wins. Up<br />against these two alone, it seems unlikely that<br />\"3 Body Problem\" will win, so I put my probability<br />around 20%.","Reece Slater (4%): I haven't seen any of these<br />shows personally, but everyone online seems to<br />be talking about Shogun and The Crown as the<br />front-runners, and noting \"3 Body Problem\" as a<br />very random nomination. Also, Mr. and Mrs. Smith<br />is largely talked about from some sources. I have<br />yet to see a prediction that even mentions \"3 Body<br />Problem\" to win, so I'm going to gamble and say 4%<br />chance.","Erin Ho (15%): Full disclosure, I have not<br />watched any of the shows that have been listed<br />for this Emmy Award and I’ve only “loosely”<br />heard about some of them from people I know.<br />Looking at previous years Emmy Award winners<br />for this category, many of them had more than<br />20 nominations in other categories and some won<br />multiple Emmys on top of the Outstanding Drama<br />Series. While “3 Body Problem” might have 6 Emmy<br />nominations overall, it’s facing off against<br />other series in this category that have 18 or<br />more nominations such as “Shogun” and “The Morning<br />Show.”","Shayna Van Glish (30%): I think that is is<br />unlikely that 3 Body Problem will win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding Drama Series, as Shogun is<br />leading most predictions. However, it definitely<br />is a contender so there still is a chance it could<br />happen.","Alexis Frazer (25%): While there is a chance that<br />3 Body Problem will win the Emmy, its contenders<br />are more critically acclaimed and recieved more<br />nominations, which is a solid indicator that they<br />will receive more Emmys.","Colin Barry (0.5%): I think that \"3 Body Problem\"<br />has an incredibly low chance to win the award for<br />Most Outstanding Drama at around a 0.5% chance<br />to win. This is because the show is nominated<br />for very few awards, a characteristic that many<br />shows that due end up winning the award share. As<br />well as being nominated in the same wave as FX's<br />\"Shogun\", which is on pace to sweep the Emmys in a<br />fashion never before seen for a single season of a<br />tv show.","Oladipupo Fashogbon (40%): There are other shows<br />like shotgun that have a higher chance of winning.<br />That show has a higher rotten tomatoes and<br />\"popcorn\" rating.","Gracie Culpepper (27%): I think most likely this<br />won't happen. Usually the bigger awards like<br />these will go to really popular shows, so I would<br />be surprised if this show won for this category.<br />Also, most of the time the winners for the big<br />nominations are also nominated/win other big<br />categories, and I think the likelihood of this<br />show doing that is slim. I think it could happen,<br />just is pretty unlikely.","David Daniels (12%): I would like to preface<br />this forecast by stating that I don't watch<br />the Emmys and have no particular interest in<br />them. My response is based on insights from Emmy<br />enthusiasts and viewer reactions. According to<br />Diesel Labs, \"The Three-Body Problem\" has roughly<br />a 23% chance of occurring, while opinions seem to<br />be more skeptical regarding this show. Vegas has<br />odds for \"3 Body Problem\" at +1600, which roughly<br />equates to a 5.9% chance of happening. Although<br />I am unfamiliar with the show or the Emmys, most<br />predictions suggest that \"Shōgun\" is likely to win<br />this nomination. Given these factors, I estimate<br />the probability of \"The Three-Body Problem\"<br />winning to be around 12%.","Matthew Harvey (20%): The show 3 Body Problem,<br />is a Science Fiction drama show that has been<br />nominated 6 times for this weekend's Emmy<br />Awards. It is an incredible feat for any show<br />to be considered for an Emmy, let alone 6. While<br />this would drastically raise a show's chances<br />of being selected to win the award, Each of the<br />nominations the show has gotten, are also in<br />categories with more well known shows that have<br />grown in popularity with other creations such as<br />Shogun, a top consideration for winning most/if<br />not in all the same categories as the Three-body<br />problem. While predicting winners is the backbone<br />of this class, there are news networks that hire<br />individuals with greater experience than I do<br />currenlty to pick winners of Awards shows such as<br />the Emmy's. In each of the categories the 3 Body<br />Problem is in, in none of them do the predictors<br />have it winning against its competitors. However<br />stranger and unpredictability are two things<br />to consider in any competition. That is why I<br />have a higher percentage than 13% which is what<br />you get for each event nominee winning an emmy<br />in a specific category. It should also be noted<br />that emmy's are an awards show that does not<br />care that each and every show gets an award. If<br />a show should meet the criteria to win in all<br />categories, that is the show they will choose.<br />https://variety.com/lists/2024-emmys-predictions/drama-series-2/","Victor Avila (15%): The Emmy's are in 2 days<br />and the outstanding drama award is packed with<br />great contenders. I did not hear of \"3 body<br />problem\" until reading this question, and while<br />the category has great shows like Shogun and the<br />Crown. The main reason I said it only has a 15%<br />probability to win, it because I read that Sci-Fi<br />movies are much less likely to win this category<br />and its only in its first season.","Franco Bravo (15%): One of the main reasons I<br />gave this such a low probability of happening is<br />mainly because of the competition that it has in<br />the Drama series. With shows like Shogun which<br />has been receiving massive amounts of press and<br />positive spotlight","Alex Vrolijk (30%): A lot of the articles I have<br />been reading online expect Shogun to win the award<br />for Outstanding Drama. I know very little about<br />the Emmy's or these TV shows so I chose 30. It has<br />also happened before that the winner of one of the<br />awards was unexpected, so I do not want to put too<br />confident of a probability.","Findleigh Ague (10%): Basically every source that<br />I have looked at says that Shogun is going to<br />win, and a few saw that The Crown will. I tried<br />to look mostly at media magazines and publications<br />like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, and both<br />favor Shogun. It is also important to look at past<br />winners, but in more recent years, the winners<br />have been shows like The Crown and Succession,<br />which are pretty different from 3 Body Problem.<br />It is true that shows more similar to the sci-fi<br />genre like Game of Thrones have won this award<br />many times, but based on recent trends and<br />experts' opinions on the subject, I don't think<br />that it will win.","Abigail Harris (20%): Every winner of the<br />outstanding drama series Emmy has been a serial<br />runner since 2011. This doesn’t bode well for<br />the 3 body problem which comparatively has just<br />1 season out. There’s also the matter of their<br />six nominations compared to the overwhelming mass<br />from competitors like shogun, which is typically<br />a positive indicator. Also, most of their<br />nominations are for sound mixing or cinematic<br />design while shogun is being lauded for acting<br />and personnel, not a great sign for the three body<br />problem to win in an overall category.","Joe Ornstein (0%): The winner of the Outstanding<br />Drama Series category is typically, though not<br />always, the show with the most total nominations.<br />This year, that would be Shogun, with 25 total<br />Emmy nominations. And it has NEVER (at least in<br />the past 25 years that I checked) been the show<br />with the FEWEST total nominations (3 Body Problem<br />has six). Of all questions we've looked at so<br />far, this is the first one I'm willing to say is<br />practically impossible.","Carson Ankeny (0%): Shogun is basically Game<br />of Thrones 2.0 - a darling of this category at<br />Emmys in previous years. Additionally, Shogun<br />is nominated at a huge clip across the board of<br />categories, and won several at the Creative Arts<br />Emmys earlier this month. Three Body Problem is<br />only nominated in 6 categories, which would be<br />a historically low amount of total noms for an<br />\"overall category\" winner like winning Outstanding<br />Drama Series. While shows with few noms can win in<br />certain categories like actor if they really stand<br />out, there is basically a zero percent chance that<br />the show will win best overall without racking up<br />noms in all the other categories."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,NA)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.19,0.22,0.14999999999999999],"y":[1.0426084344042466,2.0252233273349702,2.9959327201126142],"text":["Crowd (19%)","Crowd (22%)","Crowd (15%)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":null,"line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(186,12,47,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(TRUE,NA)","legendgroup":"(TRUE,NA)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.5,0.5],"y":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"text":"","type":"scatter","mode":"lines","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0.3)","dash":"dash"},"hoveron":"points","showlegend":false,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null}],"layout":{"margin":{"t":26.228310502283104,"r":7.3059360730593621,"b":40.182648401826491,"l":157.07762557077629},"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724},"xaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[-0.050000000000000003,1.05],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"tickvals":[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["0%","25%","50%","75%","100%"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"y","title":{"text":"Probability","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"yaxis":{"domain":[0,1],"automargin":true,"type":"linear","autorange":false,"range":[0.40000000000000002,3.6000000000000001],"tickmode":"array","ticktext":["Will ByteDance announce<br />a deal to sell TikTok<br />before Dec 1?","Will the COVID-19 weekly<br />death rates in the United<br />States reach 3,000 or<br />above before Dec 1?","Will the show \"3 Body<br />Problem\" win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding<br />Drama Series on Sep 15?"],"tickvals":[1,2,3],"categoryorder":"array","categoryarray":["Will ByteDance announce<br />a deal to sell TikTok<br />before Dec 1?","Will the COVID-19 weekly<br />death rates in the United<br />States reach 3,000 or<br />above before Dec 1?","Will the show \"3 Body<br />Problem\" win the Emmy<br />Award for Outstanding<br />Drama Series on Sep 15?"],"nticks":null,"ticks":"","tickcolor":null,"ticklen":3.6529680365296811,"tickwidth":0,"showticklabels":true,"tickfont":{"color":"rgba(77,77,77,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498},"tickangle":-0,"showline":false,"linecolor":null,"linewidth":0,"showgrid":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(235,235,235,1)","gridwidth":0.66417600664176002,"zeroline":false,"anchor":"x","title":{"text":"","font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":14.611872146118724}},"hoverformat":".2f"},"shapes":[{"type":"rect","fillcolor":null,"line":{"color":null,"width":0,"linetype":[]},"yref":"paper","xref":"paper","x0":0,"x1":1,"y0":0,"y1":1}],"showlegend":false,"legend":{"bgcolor":null,"bordercolor":null,"borderwidth":0,"font":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","family":"","size":11.68949771689498}},"hovermode":"closest","barmode":"relative"},"config":{"doubleClick":"reset","modeBarButtonsToAdd":["hoverclosest","hovercompare"],"showSendToCloud":false,"displayModeBar":false},"source":"A","attrs":{"173060666fc1":{"x":{},"y":{},"colour":{},"fill":{},"shape":{},"text":{},"type":"scatter"},"173018ce12fc":{"xintercept":{}}},"cur_data":"173060666fc1","visdat":{"173060666fc1":["function (y) ","x"],"173018ce12fc":["function (y) ","x"]},"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.20000000000000001,"selected":{"opacity":1},"debounce":0},"shinyEvents":["plotly_hover","plotly_click","plotly_selected","plotly_relayout","plotly_brushed","plotly_brushing","plotly_clickannotation","plotly_doubleclick","plotly_deselect","plotly_afterplot","plotly_sunburstclick"],"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
