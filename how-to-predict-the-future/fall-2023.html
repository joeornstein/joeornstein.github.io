Swiftologists analyzing the<br />Karma music video predict that Reputation (TV)<br />will be released during the solar eclipse on<br />April 8, 2024, and announced two months earlier<br />in February. But the question wording would also<br />be satisfied by a brand new studio album or a live<br />album, and Taylor Swift is *prolific*.","Joe Ornstein (2%): Ceasefires are only negotiated<br />when *both* parties believe that peace is better<br />than what they could potentially achieve by<br />extending the conflict. And neither party believes<br />that right now. Putin thinks time is on his side:<br />Russian troops can hold their defensive line<br />until Western resolve and support dries up. And<br />the Ukrainian government is steadfastly opposed<br />to any negotiation that surrenders territory.<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/world/europe/ukraine-fight-negotiations.html","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): Taylor is dropping her<br />version of 1989 on October 27th, which means that<br />these songs will be the talk of teenage girls for<br />the next month. Her marketing is impressive and<br />her fanbase's dedication to her is even more so.<br />When this album drops, they will be satisfied for<br />at least a month and will not be clamoring for a<br />new one until at least a month later. Also, she<br />will not want to drop the albums close together<br />because they would drown each other out in the<br />press. Each one needs its own time.","Ryan Wolkofsky (40%): It appears as if the war<br />is headed to a stalemate, but not an official<br />one. Russia is dug into trenches and is not going<br />anywhere easily due to Putin's stubbornness.<br />However, Ukraine also doesn't have the manpower<br />to move them. I believe this will result in an<br />unofficial ceasefire that neither side officially<br />agrees to.","Victoria Harrill (85%): Speak Now (TV) just came<br />out, and she spaces them out a couple to a few<br />months apart.","Victoria Harrill (75%): The Wagner Chief was<br />confirmed dead in a plane crash which will damage<br />Russia's military abilities in Ukraine.","Jacob Fortner (50%): I don't know anything about<br />Taylor Swift so I'm giving it a coin flip as my<br />prediction.","Jacob Fortner (10%): I think the war will only<br />end if there is significant intervening from the<br />western hemisphere in favor of Ukraine, if this<br />does not happen (which I'm not confident in) then<br />I do not think the war will end by the end of the<br />semester.","Maggie Fertig (60%): Taylor Swift has been<br />releasing music at a rapid pace this year, already<br />with one new album and a couple re-recordings. I<br />think the odds of her announcing a new album is<br />high. But since she is working on re-recordings,<br />she may be too busy for new stuff.","Maggie Fertig (30%): The crisis has been ongoing<br />for a few months now. The odds that a ceasefire<br />will be reached before Nov 29 is low, especially<br />with tensions rising everyday. However, there is<br />still a slight possibility.","Duy Do (70%): Because she need a new album for the<br />next year.","Duy Do (30%): Because Ukraine still try to apply<br />to NATO","Kang Lee (30%): I don't believe that there is a<br />significant enough event between now and Nov 29<br />for her to announce her final album. It'd be more<br />believable for her to announce her final album<br />after the hype around the eras tour dies down<br />and after 2023. I put the probability at 30 as<br />I believe that there may be a small chance that<br />she announces it but has it set for release much<br />further down the line.","Kang Lee (40%): I believe that Russia will pull<br />out of Ukraine before the end of the semester<br />but they will not announce their desire for a<br />ceasefire until 2024. I believe that while Putin<br />is in power a ceasefire will not be called and<br />a coup will take a while to fully take away the<br />authority of Putin.","Simryn Patel (85%): she is on a good track to<br />doing this, she has been releasing one very often","Simryn Patel (30%): it has been a very long war<br />and negotiations are not being created easily","Hita Boddu (25%): She has an album coming out<br />in late October, so it is highly unlikely she'll<br />release one soon.","Hita Boddu (50%): Political disputes are<br />unpredictable so it could go either way.","Rease Bauer (65%): her next rerecorded album<br />comes out early october, so it is possible for<br />an announcement of the next rerecord but not the<br />actual release of it","Rease Bauer (40%): i know nothing about this and<br />haven't been keeping up with the war at all","Bain Fulcher (45%): 1989 TV will be released in<br />late October, so it is unlikely that she will<br />announce the next one that soon. But, it is Taylor<br />Swift, so maybe.","Bain Fulcher (50%): It is hard to say because it<br />has been going on for a while, which could mean it<br />will end soon, but maybe not.","samiha sarwar (85%): She has been very consistent<br />with her relases and gave an hint.","samiha sarwar (25%): They have been at war for<br />a while and I don't see the conflict resolving<br />anytime soon.","Peyton Murry (70%): It would make sense, but<br />Taylor Swift is unpredictable. She also usually<br />announces album releases a little further apart","Peyton Murry (25%): Russia will not back down.<br />A ceasefire will only happen if other countries<br />intervene. I don't think that'll happen within our<br />semester","Ansley Austin (80%): She recently announced 1989,<br />so Reputation is expected to be announced before<br />then December.","Ansley Austin (20%): I do not know much about<br />Russia vs Ukraine, but I don't think it'll stop<br />soon.","Harini Mohan (30%): One month isn't really enough<br />time for her to release anything.

This means that<br />everyone will be gunning to beat them and circling<br />the uga game on their calendar as their chance<br />to shock the world. Our schedule is ridiculously<br />easy, and the out-of-conference games are a joke.<br />However, an SEC team, probably either Auburn,<br />Tennessee, or Florida will beat us in a game this<br />year. We will finish the regular season with one<br />loss","Ryan Wolkofsky (20%): Looking at last year's<br />weather, the temperature in Athens dropped below<br />32F a decent amount of times. However, none of<br />those came before November 29th. With the planet<br />warming each year, I do not see the temperature<br />getting lower this year than last year. Also, I<br />live in Charlotte, NC, and am familiar with the<br />climate of this region, The temperature tends to<br />get cold around the 2nd or 3rd week of December<br />but can stay in the 50s through New Year's Day.","Victoria Harrill (90%): The past two years they<br />have shown to be undefeated.","Victoria Harrill (35%): It is not common for<br />Georgia to get below freezing before December.","Jacob Fortner (85%): Our schedule is pretty weak<br />this year with our only semi-difficult game being<br />Ole Miss which is at home. As Carson Beck gets<br />more experience, he'll get better thus making us<br />better which is why I gave us an 85% chance to go<br />undefeated in the regular season.","Jacob Fortner (25%): From how hot it has been the<br />past few years during wintertime and from the heat<br />of this year so far, I am not confident that there<br />will be a point in time before the end of the<br />semester where the temperature in Athens, GA with<br />drop below freezing.","Maggie Fertig (80%): They preformed very well<br />last year so the probability that they will be<br />undefeated again is high. However, there is a new<br />quarterback, so there is still some uncertainty<br />for how the team will perform.","Maggie Fertig (30%): It is very rare that it gets<br />this cold in Athens in November, especially with<br />global warming.

The Mega Millions is a very elusive<br />prize, that the odds of drawing it is very low.","Maggie Fertig (40%): While two tracks form her<br />previous album hit the No. 1 spot, I think the<br />chances are low that at least one song on this<br />album will hit No. 1 because right now on the<br />charts, vampire is going down and the other<br />highest spot is 39 and going down.","samiha sarwar (35%): While I know time isn't<br />the matter but someone recently won. I think the<br />chances of someone else winning is low.","samiha sarwar (95%): When her album comes out at<br />least one song has hot No. 1. She is a very good<br />artist with a large audience.","Joe Ornstein (63%): Two ways of thinking about<br />this one. On the one hand, if you look back at all<br />the Mega Millions jackpot winners over the past<br />five years, it is *very* rare to see a period of<br />77 days in which there's no winner. If you pick a<br />random 77-day period, there's about an 85% chance<br />that it will contain a jackpot winner. That said,<br />we just had a big >$1 billion jackpot, and ticket<br />sales tend to slum after those big wins, leading<br />to reduced odds of winning. There are about 11<br />million tickets being sold for each drawing,<br />22 drawings left, and 1 in 302 million odds of<br />winning the jackpot. Putting all that together,<br />you get roughly 55% chance of a ticket winning<br />the jackpot before Nov 29, but I'll bump that up<br />a bit since I expect tickets sales to increase the<br />larger the jackpot gets.","Joe Ornstein (80%): \"Will\" is, I think, the key<br />word here. The lead single \"Vampire\" already hit<br />No. 1 before the album released. Will it go back<br />to No 1? Will another track from the album hit No.<br />1? Three from her first record did, and Guts has<br />received a lot of critical acclaim, so I think the<br />odds are good.","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (50%): 50/50 chance<br />because the lottery is an unpredictable event","Victoria (Tori) Harrill (75%): With her first<br />album, \"Driver's License\" hit number one. She<br />has several fans, so it is a high possibility it<br />happens again with her new album by November.","Bain Fulcher (2%): The odds of winning a Mega<br />Millions jackpot is about 1 in 302.6 million. So,<br />it is very unlikely that someone will win between<br />now and November 29.","Bain Fulcher (85%): Her song \"Vampire\" from the<br />album is already number 9 on the list, so there<br />is a good chance that her songs will continue to<br />climb and that at least one will hit No.1.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (85%): It seems likely.","Ryan Wolkofskuy (20%): Her hit songs of this album<br />are not that good.","Hita Boddu (15%): Only 212 jackpots have been won<br />since the game began.","Hita Boddu (100%): Many of her songs from SOUR hit<br />No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100.","Harini Mohan (15%): No one had won a Mega Million<br />jackpot since April 18. It's played in 45 states<br />so the odds are pretty low for someone in Georgia<br />to win.","Harini Mohan (100%): Her new album \"Guts\" has<br />gotten popular on social media handles like<br />TikTok. One of her songs \"Vampire\" is already<br />standing at #9.","Harshini Mohan (40%): The odds of winning that is<br />low.","Harshini Mohan (85%): Her new album is getting<br />alot of attention and she might go on tour.","Rease Bauer (20%): Winning the lottery is rare so<br />a low probability makes the most sense","Rease Bauer (80%): I think a high probability<br />because her last album was a success and her two<br />songs she released as singles before everyone<br />liked","Peyton Murry (10%): It seems to only happen ab 6<br />times on avg per year and it’s already happened 8<br />times this year","Peyton Murry (30%): Needs more clout","Jacob Fortner (40%): These things never result in<br />a winner almost, and when they do it takes forever<br />so I think it happens later, if it happens.","Jacob Fortner (60%): Not a big fan of Olivia<br />Rodrigo but what seems to happen with these<br />up-and-coming artists is that they receive a great<br />deal of hype simply for them because younger. From<br />this I say it's more likely than not.","Ansley Austin (80%): 4 winners won the mega<br />million jackpot on Septermber 12, so there's<br />definitely a good probability.","Ansley Austin (80%): Vampire already has, so I<br />think a song like \"bad idea, right?\" will do the<br />same.","Kang Hyuk Lee (50%): I believe the chance of<br />someone winning the mega millions is a 50 50<br />chance.","Kang Hyuk Lee (20%): There's too many other<br />artists that are contending for top spot and I<br />don't believe Olivia's sophomore album will be<br />popular

According to the average<br />published by 538, his lead has increased steadily<br />since the beginning of this year (43 to 55%) while<br />his opponents have mostly decreased.","Maggie Fertig (65%): The cockroach count was at<br />9 over an approximate 3 week time period. At this<br />rate, the cockroach count should reach 30 by the<br />beginning of Nov. However, I suspect the counters<br />will loose motivation and forget to record the<br />counts.","Simryn Patel (60%): he has a grip on GOP voters","Simryn Patel (85%): they have already reached like<br />15","Jacob Fortner (55%): Yes, Trump is very popular,<br />but Ron Desantis is on the come up. I think the<br />main problem people have with Trump is that he<br />isn't exactly the nicest individual, but he does<br />get things done but Desantis is seen by people<br />as a better individual. (I know nothing about<br />politics)","Jacob Fortner (75%): If I recall correctly, we<br />said there was already 15 seen by this point and<br />we are only a month into the semester. With still<br />a couple months before November 29th, I think it<br />is a high probability that 30 will be reached or<br />even surpassed.","Tori Harrill (85%): Trump is significantly ahead<br />of any other candidate.

There<br />is a high probability there will be more sightings<br />before the end of the semester, so a count of 30<br />seems likely.","Jack Whipple (100%): I feel that the majority of<br />the republican party is in favor of Trump as they<br />are upset that he was not able to be president<br />last election and want him to try again this time.","Jack Whipple (90%): Creswell is known for not<br />being clean and sanitary so I think this is very<br />likely.","Harini Mohan (85%): Trump's highest average as<br />of now is 59%. That is far higher than the other<br />candidates. Also, as a previous president and<br />lots of experience, he seems to have a popular<br />advantage.","Harini Mohan (85%): There has already been so many<br />cockroaches. Also, when the weather gets colder,<br />cockroaches find their way into cracks, screens,<br />pipes, etc.","Peyton Murry (45%): He was just in jail! I don't<br />think he's a good candidate; however, I didn't<br />think he was a good candidate in 2016, yet, here<br />we are","Peyton Murry (60%): THERE ARE TOO MANY<br />COCKROACHES. Also, I apologize that I have<br />submitted all of my recent questions late. I've<br />had the issue of consistently forgetting that the<br />answers to the questions are due the day BEFORE<br />class, and not the day OF class. I will do better","Joe Ornstein (95%): I mean, he's 77 years old so<br />mortality risk is non-zero, but aside from that<br />his lead is so dominant, and name recognition so<br />powerful compared to the other candidates, that<br />there's little chance of his lead slipping before<br />the first primary in January.","Joe Ornstein (25%): To reach 30, the residents<br />of Creswell's 2nd floor would need to continue<br />reporting roach sightings over the next 10 weeks<br />at roughly the same rate as they did for the first<br />5 weeks. I expect it is more likely that the rate<br />will decrease as the weather cools and residents<br />become less diligent about reporting sightings on<br />the counter. There's a chance that someone will<br />manipulate the counter, sure, but I get good vibes<br />from Samiha and don't think it's likely.","Ryan Wolkofsky (70%): The biggest challenger,<br />DeSantis is getting little to no press.","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): The more people complain<br />about cockroaches, the more exterminators will be<br />on the floor, fighting them.","Harshini Mohan (80%): He was the previous<br />president, and he has a large number of people who<br />want him to run again.","Harshini Mohan (75%): There has already been a lot<br />of cockroaches, and as it gets colder, there will<br />probably be more.","Ansley Austin (62%): GOP primary voters should get<br />him many votes.","Ansley Austin (75%): At this rate, only a month<br />into school, it's very likely it will reach

Since the hunger games<br />came out a long time ago, there has been a lot<br />more people being able to read the book, and<br />theres a bigger fan base now.","Jacob Fortner (75%): Thee trend according to<br />the EIA is fairly convincing that the previous<br />increasing trend will continue. We are already<br />at 3.94$ per gallon so it won't take much to get<br />higher than 4$.","Jacob Fortner (20%): I didn't even know this movie<br />was coming out until I read this prompt.","Simryn Patel (10%): I feel like that is a really<br />large jump from what it is now","Simryn Patel (70%): sold a lot of the book","Ansley Austin (40%): Gas prices are slightly<br />higher now than they were last year, but I still<br />don't think it will reach over $4 on Nov 29th.

I'm not really sure.","Tori Harrill (40%): The original hunger games made<br />694.4 million. Because this hunger games isn't<br />so much of the original story, I feel less people<br />will want to see it","Ryan Wolkofsky (80%): The Middle East is exploding<br />in conflict right now. This will causes prices to<br />continue to rise.","Ryan Wolkofsky (30%): The Hunger Games has lost<br />popularity since it first came out","Jack Whipple (90%): Gas has been getting very<br />expensive","Jack Whipple (90%): Everyone is hype for a new<br />Hunger Games movie","Bain Fulcher (50%): some action is being taken to<br />reduce gas prices, but i'm not confident that it<br />will lower them that quickly.","Bain Fulcher (40%): i feel like less people will<br />see the new one because it is a prequel, so it is<br />a lot of new characters, so people will not be as<br />excited to see it. also, they may want to wait and<br />see what reviews the movie gets before they go see<br />it themselves.","Joe Ornstein (45%): Markets for gasoline<br />futures suggest that investors think the price<br />will decline between now and December. I'm not<br />tremendously confident in this forecast, as it's<br />unclear whether renewed conflict in the Middle<br />East will cause supply disruptions. The spot price<br />for a barrel of Brent crude has gone up a few<br />dollars since the war in Gaza began last week.","Joe Ornstein (15%): The highest opening weekend<br />for a Hunger Games film is $158 million, and<br />that happened 10 years ago. For Songbirds and<br />Snakes to beat that, it would have to exceed the<br />opening weekend box office for Barbie, which had<br />significantly more buzz. I don't see it happening.","Rease Bauer (60%): With the trend of how the<br />economy is going i doubt gas prices with lower","Rease Bauer (45%): I havent even heard the news of<br />this new movie so unless they do more advertising<br />i dont think it will have as great of an opening<br />compared the the barbie movie that was advertised<br />for months to get people excited to see the movie","Kang Lee (30%): I believe it is unlikely with the<br />way gas prices are looking","Kang Lee (40%): I believe it's up in the air but<br />I'm leaning towards it not","Peyton Murry (55%): The Israeli-Hamas conflict","Peyton Murry (40%): I haven't seen much hype<br />around it.

This leads<br />me to believe UGA will not be able to make the top<br />since it is 4th form last out of the SEC rankings.","Maggie Fertig (70%): The US just sent a<br />second aircraft carrier to the waters of<br />the Mediterranean to deter Hamas forces.

However, in this time, they play<br />nobody of note. Their schedule is ridiculously<br />easy with no ranked opponents, which is a big<br />indicator of whether or not you are ranked.<br />Teams across the country make their out of<br />coout-of-conferencenference schedules easy to<br />start the year so they can warm up. However, the<br />top 25 teams have 1 or 0 losses at this point.<br />Don't think we're going to be in the top 25.","Ryan Wolkofsky (60%): We are too close to<br />the action to not be involved in at least one<br />skirmish.

If he does it'll be more likely<br />for something to happen and we get drawn into<br />active conflict.","Bain Fulcher (35%): We're not even receiving<br />any votes according to the AP Poll, so I'm not<br />optimistic.","Bain Fulcher (45%): The US has been sending<br />support to Israel and I think there is a chance<br />that we will get involved if other countries do,<br />but I think there is a good chance that we will<br />not be in active conflict with a Palestinian<br />militant group.","Jacob Fortner (15%): They're not a traditional<br />powerhouse and they play in a tough conference.","Jacob Fortner (99%): This is literally what we do,<br />gotta clutch up fr fr","Joe Ornstein (5%): UGA basketball ended last<br />season with a NET ranking of 157 (out of 363),<br />based on a pretty disappointing 16-16 record. The<br />season before that it was at 152. Since the NET<br />ratings are pretty strongly correlated with the<br />AP poll, it would be pretty improbable to make<br />the top 25 in one season. Looking back at the past<br />six seasons of Men's Basketball rankings, Georgia<br />hasn't made it to the top 25 once.","Joe Ornstein (25%): As of writing, the US Navy has<br />deployed two carrier strike groups to the Eastern<br />Mediterranean, ostensibly to deter Hezbollah<br />and other regional actors from taking this<br />opportunity to attack Israel. But it's unclear<br />what exactly this threat amounts to. The US does<br />not have a mutual defense pact with Israel, and<br />would not be obligated to intervene if Hezbollah<br />were to escalate its attacks on Israel. The US<br />military would only become actively involved in<br />the conflict if its personnel were attacked (an<br />outcome that Hezbollah leadership will be keen to<br />avoid) or if Iran intervenes directly (unlikely).","Peyton Murry (40%): It seems as if they haven't<br />done particularly well the past few years.<br />Moreover, I looked at a few people on their<br />roster, and it doesn't seem like they're the best<br />players out there.","Peyton Murry (45%): This is such a loaded<br />question. While President Biden has condemned the<br />terrorist attacks against Israel, he's also stated<br />that it is not okay to take these attacks as an<br />opportunity to be Islamaphobic. This shows that<br />this is a delicate conflict, which makes it hard<br />for an outside force to just step in. Moreover,<br />Biden said that at this moment, he doesn't feel<br />the need for the US military to engage in the war,<br />because, \"Israel has one of the finest fighting<br />forces\" (60 Minutes interview). Along with this,<br />the US is currently sending war materials to<br />Israel, which stands in place of our troops.<br />However, the US is literally known for stepping<br />in when difficult conflicts like this arise, and<br />many are calling for America to do so. This puts<br />a large social pressure on America, but at this<br />point, I don't think they'll succumb to it. From<br />now until the end of November, I don't think<br />American troops will physically engage in the<br />conflict. BUT, President Biden is going to Israel<br />to show his support, and if something happens to<br />him or to anyone else of \"importance,\" I think the<br />US will engage in the conflict.","Jack Whipple (80%): I have high hopes that we can<br />be better than the years before.","Jack Whipple (90%): I feel like we may get<br />involved because we have to look out for our ally<br />countries."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.65000000000000002,0.92000000000000004,0.20000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.45000000000000001,0.65000000000000002,0.65000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.55000000000000004,0.80000000000000004,0.69999999999999996,0.90000000000000002],"y":[0.96455564710777253,1.0376361240400001,1.0272562223486603,0.98922993123997005,1.0456152156461029,1.0018025212688371,0.97577319345436986,1.0177335070213303,0.96816957681439819,0.95689535762649025,0.96728041372261941,1.0489569590426981,1.0322968676919118,0.99154763303231452],"text":["Simryn Patel (45%): according to the google trends<br />it is not on the list for costumes trending in the<br />last week","Maggie Fertig (40%): This costume isnt on the top<br />5 for the trends this past week, however it is a<br />possibility given the popularity of the movie this<br />past year.","Rease Bauer (65%): While it was really big, the<br />trend kinda came and went","Ryan Wolkofsky (92%): frighteninglyGoogle Trends<br />says there's a frighteningly high chance it will<br />be the most popular costume and it is at 92 in the<br />US right now.","Ansley Austin (20%): Though the movie was very<br />popular, I don't think it'll be the most popular.<br />It is predicted to be the 3rd most popular adult<br />costume this year.","samiha sarwar (80%): Barbie is really popular<br />right now, and with the new movie there are so<br />many variations you can be.","Tori Harrill (45%): I don't think Barbie will<br />be the most popular.

Second, I feel<br />like Joe Biden is more unpopular, because people<br />see him as a stagnant president that hasn't done<br />much since getting into office (this is not my<br />personal opinion). And, I think this opinion<br />stems from the bafflement of his oldness. I<br />mean, people call him \"Sleepy Joe.\" And, yes,<br />he is the oldest US president to get elected and<br />does seem to forget some things but CMONNN, the<br />man is literally running the United States of<br />America. I can't even function properly when I've<br />had less than 7 hours of sleep. Sorry, didn't<br />mean to get off on a tangent. I don't think his<br />approval ratings will rise 1) because of this ^<br />and 2) as the Israeli-Hamas conflict gets worse,<br />more Americans will want the US to get involved.<br />However, I don't think Biden will, unless there's<br />a large threat to American citizens.","Peyton Murry (65%): I should probably wait to<br />answer this until after the game tonight.

If his approval rating trends down in the<br />next few weeks, then you would need more than just<br />sampling error, but there's plenty of non-random<br />polling error.
