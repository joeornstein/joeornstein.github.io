However, I'm not sure<br />if Ornstein counts as being \"in the class\" or<br />not, but with age comes a higher risk of breaking<br />a bone, so I put 10% on the off chance he slips<br />while roller skating or something.","Joseph Kennedy (5%): I think it is very hard to<br />break a bone as most people have never broken a<br />bone in 18 years. I find this very unlikely that<br />someone will break a bone in this class beofre the<br />end of the semester.","Meredith Stevens (10%): 1) Not a high chance<br />unless it’s some freak accident 2) Bone breaks<br />don’t occur as commonly as they did when we were<br />kids because we are more cautious.","Noah Herndon (25%): I give this question a pretty<br />low probability of happening. Breaking bones<br />aren't really often occurrences. Bones are usually<br />broken through sports, and I highly doubt anyone<br />in this class will be playing sports for UGA which<br />is why I give it a low probability of occurring.","Edward Cox (35%): It is unlikely that someone will<br />break a bone because annually, about 2.8 out of<br />100 people break a bone. since this is half of a<br />year, I took that in half and based it off of how<br />many people are in the class. Then, I considered<br />the possibility that people are going to be drunk<br />which raises your chances to break a bone by 2<br />times. lastly, this is the first time people are<br />living by themselves so they are more likely to do<br />stuff without thinking as much.","Andrew Decker (10%): Statistics show that 7.7% of<br />people between 15-24 break a bone every year. With<br />that stat in mind I believe the odds are low of<br />someone breaking a bone from now until Nov.","Joe Ornstein (15.7%): There are roughly seven<br />million broken bones each year in the United<br />States, or an incidence of about 2% of the<br />population per year. A study from England<br />(https://medicalxpress.com/news/2008-01-annual-bone-fracture-percent-previous.html)<br />suggests that the rate of fracture is twice<br />as high for people in the age group we're<br />considering, so let's say 4% per year. That's<br />about 1% per 3 months (September - November). If<br />each member of the 17-person class (including me,<br />but assuming that at least one person never shows<br />up) has a 1% chance of breaking a bone, then the<br />chance that *no one* breaks a bone is 0.99^17, or<br />about 84.3%. The chance that at least one person<br />breaks a bone is 100 minus that.","Jeremy Lee (30%): 1. A lot of people play sports<br />so there is a good chance someone could break a<br />bone 2. I think that breaking bones isn’t that<br />common as an injury","David Barrero (35%): As people reach their young<br />adult stage they are less likely to break a bone<br />because their bone mass is denser. The probability<br />is higher because a lot of students in our class<br />do play sports which increases the chance that<br />someone in the class will break a bone.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): We have a lot of recreational<br />athletes in this class, but I don't believe we<br />have any UGA athletes. Because of this, it is safe<br />to say that we do not have too many people with<br />time to do activities such as sports to risk a<br />bone break.","Hannah Jones (20%): It is very rare to see someone<br />on campus with a cast on because they broke a<br />bone. With all the classes at UGA, I find it very<br />unlikely that one of the smallest classes such as<br />ours (around 15-20 people) would have someone with<br />a broken bone. I also think that there may be some<br />sort of injury but not to the extent of breaking.<br />Breaking a bone would mean a serious hit was<br />taken. Leading me to believe there is a very low<br />chance of someone in our class breaking a bone.","Mac Kinnebrew (20%): We have 17 people in our<br />class so I think there is a low chance someone<br />breaks something. I do think there is a chance<br />though because a lot goes on in college and freak<br />accidents do happen.","Ian Driggers (20%): I don’t think that anyone<br />in our class will break a bone before the end of<br />class. I think that a lot of kids in our class are<br />active but we do not play many contact sports on<br />the regular so the chances for us to break bones<br />decreases.","Nicholas Chao (80%): Even though there is only 17<br />people in this class, I still believe breaking a<br />bone is common enough to happen by the end of the<br />semester.","Adam Szczupak (15%): Although we are all very<br />active individuals, none of us play contact sports<br />and are young.","audrey Vaughan (20%): Not many people have broken<br />bones walking around campus so the likelyhood<br />of it happening in our class is very slim Most<br />broken bones happen through sports and intense<br />activities, which many of us arent participating<br />in"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.91500000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.94999999999999996,0.34999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.75,0.90000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.84999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.80000000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.89000000000000001,0.97999999999999998,0.84999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.55000000000000004,0.84999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.75,0.59999999999999998,0.75,1,0.90000000000000002,0.87,0.94999999999999996,0.84999999999999998],"y":[2.9860334061086178,2.0296851141378283,3.0352656958391888,1.9968789276201278,3.0199388271197676,1.9680186693090946,3.0324435700662433,2.0236425550654529,2.9844196703052148,1.9759249771945178,2.9688095929333942,1.9780650567729026,2.975662121945061,1.9649401722010225,2.9707202475052328,1.9611379951238632,3.0351987496018409,2.0014354534447194,2.9750929211266337,1.9789898490533233,3.0446628460194916,1.9954363282537089,2.964282682375051,2.0052331112092361,2.9686398547608404,1.9876359646674246,2.9972823372110726,2.0168962720548733,2.9651236219797283,2.0315525971120225,2.9644139755750074,2.0445207725046202],"text":["Patrick Egan (91.5%): ESPN's Football Power Index<br />(FPI) is a measure of team strength that is meant<br />to be the best predictor of a team's performance<br />going forward for the rest of the season. ESPN<br />gives UGA a 91.5% chance of winning. Yes; I am<br />copying ESPN for my homework.","Patrick Egan (90%): Using data from the<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration<br />(NOAA), which is apparently part of the Chamber<br />of Commerce, I was able to pull up the low<br />temperatures for every September day for the<br />previous 10 years. In those 10 years, 9/10<br />Septembers had a day where the low was below 62,<br />which the only exception being 2018. There is<br />currently a 3 year streak of having at least one<br />low in the high 50s, and I anticipate that to<br />continue.","Joseph Kennedy (95%): Georgia football is better<br />than Oregon football. Also the game is in Atlanta<br />and even tho it is a neutral field more UGA fans<br />will most likely come.","Joseph Kennedy (35%): In Athens from the months of<br />August to September, the average low during these<br />months is 67 degrees Fahrenheit. On average, this<br />makes it unlikely that the temperature will drop<br />below 62, but there is a slight chance since it is<br />only a 5 degree difference.","Meredith Stevens (90%): 1) 2022 National Champs 2)<br />Have beat Oregon past several years","Meredith Stevens (75%): 1) Georgia weather is very<br />bipolar it has a high chance to hit that at least<br />once 2) We transition into fall making the weather<br />colder","Noah Herndon (90%): Georgia is coming off a<br />National Championship winning season, and I don't<br />see them struggling with any SEC teams in the<br />regular season much less a PAC-12 team. Oregon<br />is the same team that lost to Utah twice in the<br />same season last year. Oregon is also coached by<br />Dan Lanning, the former defensive coordinator of<br />the dawgs. I think it would be a lie to say that<br />Kirby doesn't have him figured out. And finally,<br />while our QB just won a national championship and<br />decided to come back for even more, their QB has<br />lost to the dawgs 3 years in a row at Auburn. I<br />give Oregon a 10% chance to win because any team<br />in college football can win at any time, so it<br />would be unreasonable to give the dawgs a 100% to<br />win.","Noah Herndon (80%): I give it an 80% chance to<br />happen because if we look at past trends, such<br />as last years weather, the temperature dropped<br />below 62 degrees Fahrenheit multiple times before<br />October.","Edward Cox (85%): Uga is a much more talented<br />team through recruitment, their new head coach<br />is our past defensive coordinator. They have lost<br />valuable players due to the transfer portal due to<br />their past coach leaving.","Edward Cox (15%): Geographically, Athens is in a<br />place where the temperature doesn’t drop below 70<br />degrees Fahrenheit until later October. Being in<br />the south of the US, the weather is all over the<br />place but due to the humidity and the sunlight<br />exposure every day, it is very unlikely.","Andrew Decker (80%): Although the game is not<br />a home game, the game is still in the state of<br />Georgia so UGA will still have a \"home\" field<br />advantage. UGA also has had better recruiting<br />classes than UofO so I think they have better odds<br />a winning.","Andrew Decker (90%): According to recent data,<br />Athens temperature have reached into the 50's<br />towards the end of September. In the past 10<br />Septembers, 9 out of 10 have reached under 62.","Joe Ornstein (89%): The Vegas moneyline<br />(https://www.vegasinsider.com/college-football/matchups/georgia-vs-oregon/)<br />is currently -909 for a bet on UGA. You can win<br />$100 if you risk $909. That only makes sense<br />for bettors if they think there's at least a 90%<br />chance that UGA will win ( 909 divided by 100<br />+ 909 ). This is consistent with ESPN's model<br />(https://www.si.com/fannation/college/cfb-hq/ncaa-football/georgia-oregon-week-1-college-football-picks-predictions-odds-line-spread)<br />called the \"Power Index\", which predicts a 91.5%<br />chance that UGA will win.","Joe Ornstein (98%): Looking back<br />through the Weather Underground archives<br />(https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ga/athens/KAHN/date/2021-9),<br />the temperature at the Ben Epps weather station<br />has dropped below 62 F before September 30 every<br />year this century. But the *number* of days with<br />temperatures below 62 F has been decreasing. It<br />seems extremely unlikely, but not impossible, that<br />we'd break the streak this year.","Jeremy Lee (85%): 1. UGA is coming off of a<br />dominant championship season 2. UGA football is<br />the best in the nation","Jeremy Lee (15%): 1. It’s been very hot in GA<br />recently 2. Each year, it’s been getting hotter","David Barrero (85%): UGA is the reigning National<br />Champion and only lost one game last year while<br />Oregon lost three of their last five games the<br />previous season. UGA was also ranked #3 in best<br />recruiting classes of 2022 while Oregon was ranked<br />#13.","David Barrero (70%): In 2021, the temperature<br />in Athens fell below 62 degrees Fahrenheit<br />about 5 times during the month of September. The<br />probability is lower this year because of global<br />warming and the rise in the average temperatures<br />every year.","Arianna Ycaza (90%): The game is in Atlanta, there<br />will be many more UGA fans than Oregon fans there<br />which will rally up the dawgs.","Arianna Ycaza (40%): I think it will happen early<br />morning or at overnight between now and the end of<br />September, but not soon and not during the day.","Hannah Jones (90%): The University of Georgia<br />athletic teams are part of the south-eastern<br />conference (SEC) which is the strongest conference<br />in the nation compared to any other. The<br />University of Georgia also has signed more 5-star<br />recruits than any other football team in the past<br />five years, making them overall stronger than any<br />other team. This leads me to believe UGA will win<br />against Oregon.","Hannah Jones (55%): Georgia weather is highly<br />non-reliable and constantly changing from one<br />end of the spectrum to another. Some days are 85<br />with others going all the way down to 60. Because<br />of this i believe there is a fair chance that at<br />least one day will fall under 62. Georgia weather<br />also sees a lot of rain, with rainy skies comes<br />lower temperatures. Leading me to believe there is<br />a slight but very possible chance that the weather<br />could fall under 62.","Mac Kinnebrew (85%): The spread of this game is<br />-17 in Georgia's favor so they are highly favored.<br />This game is also in Atlanta which is much closer<br />to Athens than Eugene, Oregon, giving Georgia<br />heavy home field advantage.","Mac Kinnebrew (90%): I think this because over<br />this history of weather being recorded here the<br />average low is around 60 in the last week of<br />September. Last year there were around 10 days<br />that the temp dipped below 62 so it is highly<br />likely to happen this year.","Ian Driggers (75%): I think that UGA is a better<br />football team that Oregon but I am not 100%<br />confident. Football is a sport and like any sport,<br />anything can happen on any given day.","Ian Driggers (60%): I haven’t lived in athens<br />very long but I think that it will drop below 62°<br />Fahrenheit by September 31st. I think that we will<br />get some rain and it will drop the temperature.","Nicholas Chao (75%): I believe that UGA has a<br />football team that is really good and is 3 times<br />more likely to beat oregan.","Nicholas Chao (100%): I believe there will be that<br />night where the temperature will go down that low.","Adam Szczupak (90%): Implied probability of Vegas<br />moneyline","Adam Szczupak (87%): Low temperatures at night get<br />cold. I have lived in GA my whole life, so this is<br />purely qualitative.","audrey Vaughan (95%): UGA has a much better record<br />and team then Oregon ESPN predicts that UGA will<br />win","audrey Vaughan (85%): For several years in a<br />row the temperature has dropped below 62 before<br />October starts 62 is not that low so its very<br />possible that this will happen"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.23999999999999999],"y":[0.97741606982890517],"text":"Class

But if I were to guess, I do know the<br />publicity might be the motive.","Joe Kennedy (65%): Georgia is one of the cheapest<br />states for gasoline, as as the supply for gas<br />has began to increase again, I would say a drop<br />in twenty cents in 8 and a half weeks is pretty<br />likely. This considers how gas prices have dropped<br />25 cents in two weeks in Athens, GA. However,<br />something like Russia v Ukraine could happen again<br />and limit supply of gasoline.","Joe Kennedy (100%): Yes it abs already happened as<br />of August 30, 2022, his approval rating hit 44%,<br />the highest of the year.","Joe Kennedy (5%): This is very unlikely due<br />to Kanye’s song “heartless”, where in the song<br />he says “you run and tell you friends that you<br />leaving me / they say that they don’t see what<br />you see in me / you wait a couple months then you<br />goin’ see / you’ll never find nobody better than<br />me” and these lines reflect what just happened<br />with Kim and Kanye after Kim broke up with Pete.<br />I think Kanye’s ego is to big to take Kim back,<br />especially due to these lyrics he wrote and<br />released over 10 years ago.","Patrick Egan (1%): In the past week, the gas<br />price has dropped 4 cents. In 13 weeks, it will<br />be November 30th. It is unlikely the gas price<br />will be a constant 4 cents per week, but it is<br />definitely likely to keep dropping and now balance<br />out yet. However, it's like the drop will be<br />between 30-52 cents. Meaning I'm expecting the<br />price to be below $3.00 on November 30th, and<br />especially below $3.10. However I didn't put 0%<br />because I'd look very dumb if it ended up being<br />above $3.10.","Patrick Egan (50%): I wasn't sure what to answer,<br />so I decided to determine his approval rating<br />using the worst possible prediction method<br />possible: Asking strangers on Reddit. Only 6<br />responded, very helpful, internet. The responses<br />split 3-3.","Patrick Egan (0%): Kanye West will be too busy<br />planning his 2024 Presidential Election campaign<br />to even consider lending even a short moment<br />of his attention span over to Kim Kardashian.<br />Kim Kardashian will start October by dating a<br />multitude of men, including Drake, James Harden,<br />Pete Davidson again, Joe Ornstein, and Glen<br />Quagmire. However, on November 29th, Kim will run<br />up to Kanye and beg Kanye to get back together<br />with him, but before he can accept, he gets a call<br />from the Republican Party informing him that he<br />has already won the nomination for the Republican<br />ticket in the 2024 election, and decides that he<br />doesn't have time to date Kim and also win the<br />presidential election. They end up not getting<br />back together, and Kanye West ends up becoming<br />president, and he marries Pete Davidson instead.","Noah Herndon (60%): I'm not too confident on the<br />probability of this one happening either, but I am<br />going to lean towards gas being higher than $3.10<br />because there is no telling what could happen in<br />the war in Ukraine and how that could affect gas<br />prices.","Noah Herndon (60%): I have no clue, so I'm going<br />to play it safe. I'll give it a 60% chance of it<br />being over 42% because he is currently over 42%<br />and the approval ratings don't drastically change<br />that much.","Noah Herndon (10%): Kanye can post on Instagram<br />and dog on Pete Davidson all he wants, but that<br />doesn't mean he is going to get back with Kim.<br />I think Kanye could've had a chance to get back,<br />but he's done too much damage to be able to win<br />Kim back over. I don't think the way you win your<br />ex-wife back over is posting private messages all<br />over social media.","Joe Ornstein (15%): The 2022 rise in gas prices<br />was driven by a reduction in supply related<br />to the pandemic and Russian sanctions, plus<br />resurgence in demand since lows in early 2020.<br />Oil production is a long term investment, so it<br />takes years to bring new capacity online, but<br />the trends are towards increasing production<br />plus decreasing demand (owing to increasing<br />fuel efficiency / electric vehicles). It is most<br />likely that gas prices will decrease the rest of<br />the year. But will they decrease by 20 cents per<br />gallon in 3 months? The national average price<br />for regular gas has decreased $1/gallon over the<br />past 2 months, so that's not an implausible rate<br />of change. Futures markets (a type of market<br />where you can buy, say, a barrel of crude oil<br />for a certain price a certain number of months<br />from now) suggest that regular gas will decrease<br />by 51 cents during the final quarter of 2022<br />(https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/prices.php)<br />Of course, there may be further supply<br />disruptions: there could be another pandemic, or<br />an escalation in the Ukraine-Russia War, or some<br />other Black Swan event that drives up oil prices<br />again. Also, maybe the Marathon outside of Russell<br />Hall goes out of business, and I'm not sure how<br />we'll resolve the question if that happens.","Joe Ornstein (75%): Outside View: There are 87<br />days between now and November 30. Between days<br />591 and 678, most presidents over the past 50<br />years have slightly improved their approval<br />numbers. (The exception is Bush 2, whose numbers<br />were artificially high post 9/11). Since Biden's<br />approval rating is currently above 42%, this<br />suggests a greater than even chance that it will<br />still be above 42% in three months. Generally,<br />presidential approval has become more stable<br />over time, as the electorate has polarized and<br />people tend to make up their minds about the<br />president early on. Large three month swings are<br />unlikely without a significant external event.<br />Inside View: Biden's approval rating lows over<br />the summer seemed pretty closely tied to concerns<br />about inflation, particularly gas prices. (There's<br />a weak, but significant relationship between<br />the price of gas and presidential job approval:<br />https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/gas-prices-and-presidential-approval/).<br />If I think there's an 85% chance of gas prices<br />going down significantly, then I should think<br />there's a similar chance of Biden's approval<br />rating staying where it is or inching higher.","Joe Ornstein (1%): Outside View: According<br />to some research, 10-15% of divorced<br />couples eventually reconcile. There is<br />some evidence that celebrity marriages<br />are twice as likely to dissolve as normies<br />(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/better-divorce/202206/why-many-divorced-partners-remarry-each-other),<br />and 3 months is a short time window, so 10% seems<br />like an upper bound. Inside View: To help me<br />with this question, I consulted with an expert<br />in the field of Kardashianism, my wife Carly.<br />She is a person who, let's say, keeps up with the<br />Kardashians. From this conversation, I gather that<br />Kimye's differences are irreconcilable, and there<br />is very little chance that this will be one of<br />those 10% of divorces that get back together. At<br />some point over the next three months, Kim will do<br />*something* to get back on the public's radar, but<br />it's unlikely to be getting back with Kanye. I'll<br />tack on one percent because things happen.","Adam Szczupak (38%): Gasoline prices have<br />consistently been lowered over the last few<br />months, and I expect this trend to continue. The<br />uncertainty lies in to what extent.","Adam Szczupak (69%): Due to midterm elections in<br />early November, Biden will likely not say or pass<br />anything that would lower his party’s electability<br />or popularity.","Adam Szczupak (5%): Kim has never gotten back<br />together with an ex and Kanye has publicly been<br />shaming her for her actions with their children.<br />Although they were once married and would announce<br />it publicly rather soon.","Jeremy Lee (60%): - I honestly don't know because<br />the gas prices have been dropping, but they can<br />rise again - I think it will have to be above<br />$3.10 because of inflation","Jeremy Lee (75%): Biden's approval rating has been<br />increasing in the past 100 hundreds - The trend<br />from the other presidents has been increasing in<br />approval rating as they approach the 2nd year","Jeremy Lee (10%): - They seem to have a strong<br />disliking against each other now - They don't seem<br />to match each other's personalities","audrey vaughan (75%): although gas prices have<br />been dropping, its not very likely for it to drop<br />20 cents in 3 months inflation will probably not<br />get much better within the next 3 months.","audrey vaughan (85%): the previous presidents<br />stay pretty constant with their rating after the<br />2nd year, and he's at 42% right now, and it wont<br />be very likely for it to drop much lower based on<br />previous ratings. the population of republicans<br />and democrats are both around 40% and dont seem to<br />drop much lower than that.","audrey vaughan (5%): Kanye has brought their<br />relationship very public and bashed Kim several<br />times online, so because they've made everything<br />so public it would be harder for them to get back<br />together without Kim embarrassing herself. it's<br />been made very apparent that Kanye's relationship<br />with his children has gotten much worse and for<br />their sake I don't think Kim would get back with<br />him.","David Barrero (65%): Not much information to<br />gather and make a confident forecast, but usually<br />during the winter gas prices tend to drop which<br />is why the probability is low. I don't believe it<br />will fall as much as $3.10 because gas prices have<br />been very high this year and will continue to be<br />for the rest of the year","David Barrero (90%): Since January 2021 Biden's<br />approval rating fell under 42% in about three<br />or four of the months during that time span. The<br />November midterms could bring it under 42% by<br />making everything more divisive.","David Barrero (5%): I haven't seen any evidence<br />to show that either party are moving towards<br />reconciling with each other. Kanye continues to<br />post random stuff on his Instagram while having<br />internet \"beef\" with Pete Davidson who is Kim's ex<br />now.","Hannah Jones (70%): Gas will only continue to<br />increase due to competitors having to constantly<br />raise their prices. Not only that but it will be<br />football season in Athens which means gas will<br />be particularly high for a while to gain as much<br />money as possible. I think the price will stay<br />around $3.49 or definitely above $3.10. Football<br />season is prime time to make as much profit as<br />possible especially for home games when so many<br />fans travel.","Hannah Jones (55%): Currently (two months before),<br />it is 42.8% approve. I believe this means he<br />has rather a very good chance of that increasing<br />above 42% very easily by November 30th. I believe<br />this will also have a lot to do with the current<br />elections upcoming. Not only that, but looking at<br />the graph is shows that Biden's approval has only<br />increasingly gone up since July, which gives a<br />strong hint that it will continue to grow.","Hannah Jones (50%): Kanye will most likely<br />come out with an album before he gets back<br />together with Kim. This would be the perfect<br />publicity stunt. I believe after the album has<br />been successful, him and Kim will then publicly<br />announce that they are back together. Yet, knowing<br />how dramatic KIm and Kanye are, the chance of them<br />announcing they are back together before November<br />30th is still majorly possible. This makes my<br />prediction an even 50/50 because with these two<br />A-list celebrities, you really cannot say.","Andrew Decker (70%): I believe the Ukranian war<br />will still be going on in November so I doubt gas<br />prices will get any cheaper.","Andrew Decker (80%): I think Biden will get a<br />midterm bump in the polls. In general, after the<br />midterms, a presidents approval doesn't see a<br />steep decline.","Andrew Decker (20%): I highly doubt they will get<br />back together. The only factor that supports them<br />getting back together is the fact that they have<br />kids together.","Meredith Stevens (80%): 1) already above $3.10 2)<br />gas prices keep increasing","Meredith Stevens (85%): 1) currently at 43% 2)<br />most likely will stay consistent","Meredith Stevens (15%): 1) just went through messy<br />divorce 2) public opinion would be brutal","Mac Kinnebrew (60%): Gas is going down slowly, but<br />I do not think it will get below 3.10","Mac Kinnebrew (35%): During election season people<br />feel like more things are wrong and they focus on<br />everything they can to try and prove things are<br />wrong.","Mac Kinnebrew (10%): They are at different points<br />in life and I do not see them back together","Arianna Ycaza (30%): Yes, prices are dropping<br />again we’ve just seen them in a pattern.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): There is a lot of controversy<br />about his passing of the federal student loans<br />forgiveness.","Arianna Ycaza (20%): I don’t likely see this<br />happening because especially right now they tend<br />to fight over the internet a lot. Also think that<br />Kim and Kanye have been together consistently<br />since they started dating, it’s unlikely they<br />would get back together.","Ian Driggers (65%): I think gas prices will be<br />greater than $3.10 on November 30. I think they<br />will because there will be a switch from the<br />summer blend to the winter blend and diesel is<br />less expensive in the winter and unleaded is more<br />expensive.","Ian Driggers (60%): I think that it will be at<br />least 42% on November 30th. I think that democrats<br />in some states have a decent change of winning<br />some house/senate positions and I think that will<br />help boost his approval rating.","Ian Driggers (10%): Indont think so.

However, since there is a<br />93% change to win each game 12 different times,<br />we must raise .93 to the 12th power to get our<br />probability which is 41%","Patrick Egan (34%): I found a website where<br />some guy simulated the 2022 CFB season<br />1,000 times. In the 1,000 simulations he<br />ran, UGA won 12/12 games in 340 of the<br />1000 simulations. Here's the website:<br />https://phenrickson.github.io/cfb/team_profiles/preseason/2022/Georgia.html","Noah Herndon (90%): I give the dawgs a 95% chance<br />to go undefeated because we just beat the number<br />11 team in the nation 49-3 and they were supposed<br />to be our toughest opponent on the schedule.<br />After the ducks, the only teams that may give us<br />a problem in the first quarter are probably just<br />Tennessee, Kentucky, and Florida, but none of<br />those teams have a chance at beating us. We may<br />be a better team this year than last and that's<br />saying something. That was some of the best<br />offense I've ever seen out of the dawgs and our<br />defense just reloaded.","Joe Ornstein (32%): Outside View: Since 2000,<br />there have been 5 out of 22 seasons where an SEC<br />team went undefeated (none of them UGA). This<br />suggests an \"optimism ceiling\" of about 23%. The<br />chance that Georgia goes undefeated should be less<br />than the chance that any SEC team goes undefeated.<br />Alternatively, if I thought that UGA had a 90%<br />of defeating Oregon, and has the same chance of<br />defeating each of the remaining 11 teams in its<br />regular season (optimistic), then its chance<br />of going undefeated is 90% x 90% x 90% .... 11<br />times, which is about 31%. Inside View: Georgia<br />is facing a pretty favorable set of teams in<br />the regular season this year. Arguably our most<br />challenging opponent is Tennessee. Consequently,<br />ESPN's statistical model gives UGA a 21% chance of<br />going undefeated (including the SEC champsionship,<br />presumably against Alabama), which suggests<br />roughly a 40% chance of going undefeated in the<br />regular season alone. I'll split the difference<br />between these two perspectives.","Adam Szczupak (84%): The only games I think they<br />have a change to lose are Tennessee, Kentucky, and<br />Florida. Each of these games according to ESPN are<br />about 90% chance of Georgia winning. So all three<br />together (parlayed) imply a lower probability than<br />90, but still high.","Jeremy Lee (75%): After watching the Oregon game,<br />I can tell that UGA is a very dominant team - UGA<br />was undefeated in the regular season last year","audrey vaughan (95%): all the teams they play in<br />the regular season they beat last year they had an<br />undefeated regular season last year","David Barrero (88%): If the SEC championship<br />does not count toward the regular season UGA will<br />go undefeated this regular season because their<br />schedule does not looks similar if not worse than<br />last year where they went undefeated. I give UGA<br />a 12% chance of not going undefeated because these<br />are young players which mean more mistakes can<br />take place and sports can be a very volatile when<br />trying to give predictions.","Hannah Jones (85%): UGA will play teams ranked<br />much lower than them in the SEC. These teams<br />include: Missouri, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt. Even<br />the teams ranked a little higher do not stand a<br />chance against UGA's defense. UGA also has much<br />more 5 stars and returning strong players from<br />years before. Many of these players obtain a<br />major part in the offensive side of the team. The<br />only thing I can say to pose the opposite opinion<br />is that sports is very dependant on the actions<br />within the game. UGA could lose to any of these<br />teams solely because of a bad game, which is why<br />i put 85% of winning instead of 100%. But, UGA has<br />the potential to go undefeated this season.","Andrew Decker (50%): I think UGA looked very<br />strong in its first game against Oregon. I would<br />say that the only challenge to UGA this season are<br />is UTK. I think that will be the toughest game.","Meredith Stevens (75%): 1) undefeated last season<br />2) current national champs","Mac Kinnebrew (50%): I think that they should<br />win every game, but it is very challenging to go<br />undefeated in a college football season.","Arianna Ycaza (85%): We will more than likely<br />beat all the teams we are playing solely by our<br />tendency to win against them and their tendency to<br />lose when put up against teams that compare to us.","Ian Driggers (90%): I think UGA will go undefeated<br />in the regular season.

To start, it took \"Top<br />Gun: Maverick\" 1 month to reach $500 million<br />dollars in the box office, so if you give a movie<br />that has similar hype going into it twice as long<br />to reach the same box office total, I would think<br />that this could happen. This movie containing<br />Harry Styles makes it seem to have a large box<br />office with his insane amount of fans, so I think<br />that this is likely to happen.","Joseph Kennedy (25%): I think tensions will<br />continue to settle down in the coming weeks, but<br />I do not think that a ceasefire will be declared<br />before 2023. I think that the situation is to<br />large for Russia to think of peace so soon after<br />starting something so crazy.","Arianna Ycaza (35%): The opening weekend for<br />the film is projected to make in the high-teens<br />millions, and this is typically the weekend that<br />movies make the most money. In 2 months with each<br />weekend likely declining in box office revenue, it<br />is very unlikely that the box office revenue will<br />surpass $500million by November 23. Even if the<br />movie makes $19million for 8 weeks straight, the<br />box office revenue will not even make $200million<br />in that time frame.","Arianna Ycaza (20%): According to the Brookings<br />Institute, a cease-fire is unlikely due to the<br />fact that even that agreement would leave parts<br />of southern and eastern Ukraine occupied with no<br />guarantee that Russian intervention would cease.","Edward Cox (1%): After seeing the initial reviews,<br />people are going to loose interest and not want to<br />see it.","Edward Cox (20%): Seeing how unstable Putin is and<br />how far he has come, it is very unlikely that he<br />will call a ceasefire with Ukraine. He is going to<br />keep pushing until he cannot anymore.","Mac Kinnebrew (30%): The Elvis movie is not yet at<br />500 million and Elvis is a much bigger name movie.<br />This movie also has a small target range of young<br />women and not as many less men.","Mac Kinnebrew (25%): There are still many ongoing<br />invasions in Ukraine right now. This war has also<br />been going on for much longer than people thought<br />it would so it may not come to an end soon.","Adam Szczupak (21%): I haven’t heard of this<br />movie and I consider myself to be active with pop<br />culture; however, the fact that Harry styles is<br />in it significantly increased it’s odds because of<br />his huge fan base. Also, it has been a while since<br />a big movie came out. Odd time to release though,<br />as summer blockbusters usually gross more.","Adam Szczupak (15%): Russia is starting to get out<br />of the news and thus foreign condemnation, so they<br />would probably rather have the Ukrainian resources<br />than attempt to alieviate any issues with the west","Patrick Egan (1%): In 2022, there have been 7<br />movies that have grossed more than $500 million.<br />One of those was only released in China so I'm<br />ignoring it. However, the 6 worldwide movies<br />that grossed over 500 Million were all part of<br />pre-existing franchises. Top Gun, Jurassic World,<br />Doctor Strange, Minions, The Batman, and Thor.<br />All pre-existing series. Two other movies that<br />fell just short were the new Fantastic Beasts and<br />Sonic 2. The point is that Movies that aren't part<br />of already established series don't seem to make<br />it close to the $500 million mark. If we were to<br />find the highest movies that stem from a previous<br />movie, we'd find Uncharted and Elvis, which<br />made a respectable 400M and 250M, respectively.<br />However, those still come from pre-existing<br />names, with Uncharted starting out as a massively<br />popular Video Game franchise and Elvis, which is<br />Elvis. The highest grossing, completely original<br />movie (which is a movie that's not based off of<br />something else, or by some company like Disney<br />or Marvel that just always gets a lot of people<br />to watch) was Bullet Train. Bullet Train did not<br />even make $200M. The same research holds true for<br />2021, where the highest grossing original film was<br />Free Guy with only 331M. In fact, you would have<br />to go all the way back to 2017 to find a movie<br />which grossed over 500M that wasn't based off of<br />some pre-existing property. That movie was The<br />Boss Baby it barely passed with 525M. In order for<br />Don't Worry Darling to gross more than $500M in<br />box office revenue, it would have to do something<br />that hasn't been done in over 5 years by the Boss<br />Baby. The only way I can see Don't Worry Darling<br />passing 500M is if they replace Harry Styles with<br />a baby in a suit.","Patrick Egan (7%): UN Secretary-General António<br />Guterres said on 9/15 he feels a peace deal to<br />end the war in Ukraine isn't close. “We are far<br />away from the end of the war,\" he told reporters<br />following a call with Russian President Vladimir<br />Putin. \"A ceasefire is not in sight,” he said,<br />adding, \"I would be lying if I said it would<br />happen.”","Ian Driggers (50%): I have no idea either way.","Ian Driggers (20%): Russia is not going to comply<br />with Ukraines wishes","Nicholas Chao (0%): I do not thing this will<br />happen because the most recent reviews on the<br />movie are pretty negative in itself. This movie<br />also had a low budget, making it reaching 500<br />million very difficult.","Nicholas Chao (20%): Events along the war are<br />moving very slow and do not seem they are in the<br />direction of ending the war. Some sources say that<br />a ceasefire may just cause the war to be longer.<br />As of now, the war does not seem to be ending<br />soon.","Jeremy Lee (10%): - Many movies don't make more<br />than $500 million in box revenue within 1 month,<br />and those that do are extremely popular - The<br />movie is rated R, so the audience will be much<br />smaller than other movies that have been able to","Jeremy Lee (30%): - It doesn't seem like the war<br />will be coming to an end any time soon - If the<br />war does reach to lasting for 1 year, on average<br />only 20% of those wars will end in a ceasefire","Noah Herndon (10%): $500 million is a lot of<br />money for a movie that had a 20-30 million dollar<br />budget. I have a really hard time seeing this<br />movie make that much. It would have to be a<br />massive hit, and I think there is just too much<br />controversy surrounding it for it to make that<br />much money.","Noah Herndon (20%): Ukraine has said that they<br />aren't going to accept a ceasefire if it means<br />giving themselves up to Russia, and Russia isn't<br />going to stop till they get back Ukraine, so I<br />don't really see a ceasefire happening, especially<br />before November 30th.","Hannah Jones (30%): People are not raving about<br />the movie and the reviews for the movie are not<br />amazing. Not only that but it is a thriller which<br />does not typically pull a major audience whereas<br />action/superhero does. This movie will make a good<br />amount of gross revenue but because of its bad<br />publicity and the type of movie it is, it will not<br />make that money by november 23rd.","Hannah Jones (14%): This conflict is long<br />simmering and has the tension that it will not be<br />over for quite a while. Not only that but more and<br />more attacks are happening every single day. This<br />will go on for a while.","David Barrero (5%): Only two movies in 2022 had<br />a total gross over 500 million in 2022 which<br />were Top Gun and Spiderman: Now Way Home which<br />were two blockbusters of the year and they both<br />almost didn't reach the mark. There have also been<br />critics that have had early access to the movie<br />and the reviews have not been the best which may<br />deter the public to go watch the movie.","David Barrero (10%): Instead of looking for peace<br />now, the president of Ukraine now believes that<br />the war can be won and is looking to continue to<br />fight this war until it is won. Many Ukrainians<br />want a cease-fire but only if the land that was<br />taken from their country is liberated which means<br />that they will continue fighting and no ceasefire<br />will happen soon.","Audrey Vaughan (20%): Although Harry styles<br />is very popular, the rotten tomato rating was<br />a 36% which is pretty bad. Many people really<br />rely on rotten tomato so I think that will make<br />many people not see it. The critic reviews that<br />have come out give bad reviews so that will also<br />prevent a lot of people from seeing it.","Audrey Vaughan (5%): one way a ceasefire could be<br />declared would be for other parties to enter the<br />war. This includes NATO/ china. The likelihood of<br />all parties of NATO joining is already very low,<br />and even if they did join it would take a while<br />for Russia to actually call an end to the war.<br />Along with this, the Russian government has a<br />very isolated leader who wont call for a ceasefire<br />unless he absolutely has too.","Olivia West (60%): Considering the movie \"Don't<br />Worry Darling\" stars famous celebrities such as<br />Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde, I think it has a<br />fairly high chance that will gross $500 million in<br />box office revenue before November 23rd. According<br />to the New York Times, surveys were taken from<br />consumers in regards to their interest in seeing<br />the movie, and the results conducted that \"Don't<br />Worry Darling\" is expected to receive $20 million<br />in revenue on opening night. The only doubts I<br />would have are considering the movie received<br />only 35% on rotten tomatoes, making my probability<br />slightly lower.","Olivia West (10%): Considering that the Russia<br />- Ukraine war has been ongoing for the past 6<br />months, I don't think any side will ceasefire<br />anytime soon. Russia was generally believed<br />to be preparing to quickly remove Ukraine's<br />pro-Western government, but expectations quickly<br />escalated into a bloody conflict that resulted in<br />significant destruction and casualties, further<br />lowering the possibilities that Russia or Ukraine<br />will give up after going this far.","Andrew Decker (20%): I admittedly don't know about<br />the movie much or the movie industry. I think<br />grossing 500 million in 2 months is pretty tough<br />for a movie that I barely know about. I looked<br />at the recent Spiderman No Way Home movie which<br />grossed around 760 million in two months. For<br />a Spiderman movie to gross 760 in two months, I<br />think gives this movie a low chance to make 500<br />million.","Andrew Decker (20%): I think the war in Ukraine<br />is not close to being over. I think the Russians<br />will keep occupying part of Ukraine. I see the<br />war being similar to the war in the middle east<br />where it is an ongoing conflict. Putin recently<br />said that there is no plans for him to stop the<br />invasion. They recently discovered a mass grave<br />site. In light of both recent revelations, I think<br />the war will still be going on in two months.","Joe Ornstein (5%): Pre-pandemic, there were plenty<br />of movies that topped a billion in worldwide box<br />office revenue each year. But in 2022, there have<br />so far been only 7 movies that have grossed over<br />$500 million. Each one of them is a big budget<br />(>$100 million) movie like Top Gun Maverick or<br />Jurassic World Dominion. (The sole exception is<br />Minions: Rise of Gru, which has grossed about<br />$900 million on a budget of $80 million.) For<br />comparison, Don't Worry Darling has a budget of<br />around $20-35 million, so exceeding $500 million<br />would be wildly successful. I suspect it will<br />gross less than $200 million - movies with a<br />comparable budget that were box office *successes*<br />this year include Where the Crawdads Sing ($130<br />million gross) and Scream ($140 million gross).","Joe Ornstein (10%): A lot changed since we posted<br />this question - the Ukrainian counteroffensive<br />in Kharkiv raised my estimation that Ukraine<br />could successfully retake its territory and force<br />a Russian withdrawal. That said, retaking the<br />Donbas region is likely to be more difficult, and<br />I don't expect Ukraine to outright win the war<br />over the next two months. In fact, Putin's losses<br />raise the probability of more dangerous forms of<br />escalation. Ultimately, the chance of a negotiated<br />settlement depends entirely on Putin, and I don't<br />expect him to come to the table unless he thought<br />he was in danger of losing power (or he did lose<br />power and his successor negotiated a ceasefire).<br />Such unexpected shifts are possible, but unlikely.<br />(For reasons we will discuss in a few weeks,<br />experts are nearly always surprised by major power<br />transitions in autocracies.)"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.59999999999999998,0.34999999999999998,0.84999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.25,0.75,0.45000000000000001,0.40000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.67000000000000004,0.32000000000000001,0.83999999999999997,0.62,0.48999999999999999,0.75,0.75,0.59999999999999998,0.94999999999999996,0.59999999999999998,0.75,1,0.75,1,1,0.59999999999999998,0.40000000000000002,0.5,0.45000000000000001,0.63,0.84999999999999998,0.93000000000000005,0.84999999999999998,0.94999999999999996,0.53000000000000003,0.84999999999999998,0.84999999999999998,0.5,0.5,0.59999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,1,0.55000000000000004,0.34999999999999998,0.84999999999999998],"y":[3.0288314738310875,3.9934912955854087,4.9930321122054009,3.0280450987396761,3.9753274690825493,4.966660282644443,3.0295782293193043,4.0478343343595045,4.9611878803698346,2.9818041978636756,3.9677551675587894,5.0350968018872662,3.0103559241397306,4.0405054349219425,5.0134106031386185,2.9971301270183175,3.9612870036391543,5.0063633521087469,2.9900174654088914,3.9987245667027311,5.0115846290253101,3.0166742639150472,3.9855427052592858,4.9642089785309507,3.0186274095205592,3.9554439231054856,4.9789879087358715,2.9984806188382209,4.0284184505464511,4.9505271594272928,2.9690151235787199,3.9723098182119427,4.9862358251819385,2.9850629396969453,3.9742060519522058,5.0098135492065925,2.9870189704000949,3.9883415020536632,5.0260250618681308,3.0366692453389987,3.9531861519441009,5.0068876764969898,2.9978547292994335,4.0405359512194989,5.0316036639735104,3.0374735187739135,4.0424910094123332,4.9819681784603747],"text":["Joseph Kennedy (60%): I do not know much about<br />the US senate election, especially in the state<br />of Georgia. However, as of September 13, 2022, the<br />Georgia senate polls has Herschel walker trending<br />down while Raphael Warnock trending up. Although<br />it is close, I will say Warnock will receive more<br />votes.","Joseph Kennedy (35%): According to DraftKings, the<br />braves have a 27% chance to win the division, and<br />I think I agree with them. Even though I believe<br />the Braves are a better team, they started to<br />many games back of the Mets at the start of the<br />season and that made them play catch up towards<br />the end of the season. To add, the Mets have a<br />significantly easier remaining schedule as they<br />host the pirates and marlins, and take a trip to<br />Oakland. Although the braves play the nationals,<br />they also have two series' with the Phillies, a<br />team in the playoff hunt, and with the giants,<br />another team hoping to make the playoffs. I think<br />with the +2 games the Mets have and the easier<br />schedule, they will most likely win the division<br />over the braves.","Joseph Kennedy (85%): According to forbs magazine<br />titled \"New Artemis I Launch Dates: NASA Refines<br />Launch Dates For Moon Mission\" released on<br />September 1, 2022, and then tweaked on September<br />13, 2022, the intended launch date is September<br />27, 2022. I would be sure NASA would be accurate<br />on when they decide to launch their spacecraft<br />especially since they publicly announced the date<br />twice. To add, if things do go wrong and the date<br />needs to be postponed from September 27, 2022,<br />I'm, sure it will not take longer than a month<br />more for the spacecraft to launch. But we truly<br />don't know NASA's struggles, but as of now, I<br />think a launch date before the end of the semester<br />seems likely.","Arianna Ycaza (60%): As of late August, The Hill<br />found that Walker has a 2 point lead on Warnock<br />based on a poll given to the general Georgia<br />public, however, the same poll shows that 53% of<br />Georgia voters expect Warnock to win.","Arianna Ycaza (40%): The Mets have more wins<br />overall despite the Braves having won more games<br />since June 1st.","Arianna Ycaza (85%): According to Nasa, the<br />projected launch was scheduled for September<br />3rd but could change to the 5th due to weather.<br />Considering this, it should have launched or will<br />launch as a resechedule in the weeks to come.","Edward Cox (20%): While he is more experienced<br />within the governmental side, Herschel Walker has<br />much more support even in the primary election<br />for each party. Unless more people go out and vote<br />or actually happen to care about possible abuse<br />accusations, it is likely that Walker will receive<br />more votes during the election.","Edward Cox (25%): While it is possible, it may not<br />be likely.","Edward Cox (75%): While they seem to keep pushing<br />the launch date back, I think there is enough time<br />for them to figure out their problems and what<br />they need to do before the end of our semester.","Mac Kinnebrew (45%): I chose a near 50/50<br />probability because this race is currently<br />projected to be very close and it could change<br />before the election happens. I do not think<br />Warnock will receive more votes because according<br />to fivethirtyeight Herschel is a slight favorite.","Mac Kinnebrew (40%): The Mets are 1.5 games up<br />on the Braves right now so the Braves are already<br />behind. The Mets remaining schedule is also much<br />easier.","Mac Kinnebrew (80%): The projected launch is now<br />sept. 27 so there is plenty of time to delay and<br />still launch it before the end. It has also been<br />postponed many times so I don't see it being<br />pushed back a lot longer.","Adam Szczupak (67%): Incumbency advantage and I<br />think Perdue was a much stronger candidate than<br />Walker. Moreover, the demographics of Georgia have<br />only gotten more democratic leaning since then.","Adam Szczupak (32%): Although they are 0.5 games<br />ahead and in my opinion have the superior team<br />to the Mets, the Mets have a much easier schedule<br />down the stretch and have Jacob degrom and max<br />Scherzer to catalyst their consistent win rate as<br />opposed to the braves who are more streaky. Vegas<br />has their implied probability at 34%.","Adam Szczupak (84%): They are set to launch, they<br />are just looking for a good launch window, which<br />I think is extremely likely to open up before<br />November 30th. Mechanical issues is why i put it<br />as an 84% chance, because stuff like that always<br />can delay launches or things of that nature.","Patrick Egan (62%): The race is incredibly close,<br />however I'm giving Warnock the edge because both<br />Warnock and Walker have agreed to have a debate<br />in mid October, and I think a debate will greatly<br />benefit Warnock's chances of winning.","Patrick Egan (49%): The race between the Braves<br />and the Mets is so neck and neck that I could<br />easily see it going either way. It's 49 instead of<br />50 because at the time of this prediction the Mets<br />hold a 1 game lead.","Patrick Egan (75%): NASA now says the potential<br />launch dates for Artemis 1 are September 27, with<br />a backup of October 2 now under review. If they<br />can't launch it in these days then I will be very<br />concerned.","Ian Driggers (75%): Warnock is ahead in the polls<br />right now so I am going to stick with that.","Ian Driggers (60%): I think the braves have a good<br />chance of winning but I am not sure.","Ian Driggers (95%): It is predicted to launch on<br />sept 27th so I think that if it doesn’t, there is<br />enough time to launch before Nov 30th","Nicholas Chao (60%): I think this will happen<br />because Georgia is on track to continuing on<br />becoming a swing state and lean towards the<br />democratic side. As of now even though Walker is<br />up in a very thin margin, I still believe these<br />swing states will all lean towards Warnock.","Nicholas Chao (75%): I believe that coming off<br />a world series definitely makes the Braves a<br />contender for that title again. It will be still<br />tough to beat other teams such as the Astros and<br />Dodgers, but I think for our own division, we can<br />pull through.","Nicholas Chao (100%): It is launching September<br />27th. This would make it by the end of the<br />semester. The mission will take 38 days, even<br />ending the mission before the end of the semester.","Jeremy Lee (75%): - Because GA was a blue state<br />in 2020, I think there is a good chance that they<br />will vote for a democratic senator - Warnock's<br />popularity seems to be increasing while Walker's<br />is still below Walker's","Jeremy Lee (100%): - IM RISKING IT FOR THE BISCUIT<br />I LOVE THE BRAVES - The braves have been really<br />strong this season and only have the Mets as their<br />contender who they have beat multiple times","Jeremy Lee (100%): - NASA states that they will be<br />launching Artemis I on September 27 - No way NASA<br />doesn't launch Artemis on the date they stated","Noah Herndon (60%): This one is really hard to<br />predict because Walker is not very bright and fit<br />for the job but is also Trump-endorsed and the<br />greatest running back of all time which holds a<br />lot of weight around here. Ultimately, I think<br />Walker and Warnock's debate on October 14th will<br />sway a decent amount of votes towards Warnock<br />giving him the win.","Noah Herndon (40%): I watch baseball occasionally,<br />but I'm not really informed; therefore, I played<br />it safe. I gave the Braves a less than 50% chance<br />of winning the division only because they are<br />currently down by two games, so not only do they<br />need to win the rest of their games, they also<br />need the Mets to lose at least two games.","Noah Herndon (50%): There were two scrubs within<br />one week which doesn't bode well for Artemis.<br />Whenever they extend the window for a new launch,<br />they have to make sure their new launch lines up<br />with the lunar cycle. So it's kind of a 50/50; it<br />could go either way.","Hannah Jones (45%): Currently, Walker is taking<br />the lead by 1.6%. The poll standings tell us a<br />lot about the future votes. Walker is also a fan<br />favorite for a lot of the population in Georgia<br />giving him a little bit higher advantage.","Hannah Jones (63%): They are currently ranked 2 in<br />their division which shows a good chance. The team<br />is also stacked with players that are doing really<br />good including Swanson and Acuna. The braves are<br />also known to be full of surprises. No one thought<br />they would win the world series this past season<br />and they did. They have a good chance of winning<br />their division.","Hannah Jones (85%): They have already announced<br />two possible dates including september 30th<br />and october 2nd. Both of these dates are before<br />november 30th. Nasa typically always sticks with<br />their original dates too. Forbes posted this and<br />said it is essentially scheduled.","David Barrero (93%): Raphael Warnock is the<br />incumbent senator which will result in him gaining<br />reelection and thus getting more votes than<br />Herschel Walker. In the 2020 election the average<br />winning percentage throughout the states for<br />incumbents was 93% and for Congress it was 96%.","David Barrero (85%): The Braves will win the<br />division as they have one of the best records<br />following the All-Star Game and have continued<br />their hot streak for months. Having beat the Mets<br />in the last","David Barrero (95%): This mission was supposed to<br />launch on August 29th but because of some issues<br />it has been delayed till the 27th of September<br />which still is far from November 30th if there<br />are more delays. NASA would want to launch this<br />mission as soon as possible because it will look<br />bad for them if they continue delaying the launch.","Audrey Vaughan (53%): yes- out of 6 polls, Walker<br />was ahead in 3 and Warnock was ahead in 3. So<br />based on that they are about 50-50. Another<br />article says that Warnock is leading by 1.5%<br />margin of error, so once again this isn't a<br />very large amount to be ahead by. 4 days ago, an<br />article said that 52% of Georgia voters support<br />Warnock.","Audrey Vaughan (85%): In order for the braves to<br />win their division, the Mets have to loose their<br />next game. It's between those two teams so they<br />have a pretty good chance of winning. The braves<br />have also won 5 years in a row.","Audrey Vaughan (85%): NASA says that there are<br />37 launch opportunities between now and November<br />30. That being said, they will most likely launch<br />during that time. They have already started<br />the prelaunch tests so they should be ready to<br />actually launch soon.","Olivia West (50%): I think that there is a<br />50-50 chance that Warnock will receive more<br />votes than Walker, considering the results of a<br />\"voter likeliness\" poll. According to Quinnipiac<br />University, Warnock slightly leads Walker in the<br />poll, resulting in 52% - 46% likeliness of the<br />candidates. With this, it leads to a very close<br />call in who will win the election, considering the<br />results only ranged 6%.","Olivia West (50%): For this scenario, I think that<br />there is a 50-50 chance that the braves will win<br />their division. Considering that they're on a 4<br />game winning streak and their one game back of the<br />New York Mets, they show that they have a fairly<br />competitive team. Looking at the record of the New<br />York Mets, they also have a similar winning streak<br />and overall competitiveness, making it an even<br />game for the Braves to win their division.","Olivia West (60%): According to NASA, Artemis I is<br />scheduled to launch on September 27, 2022, making<br />the possibility fairly high that it will remain on<br />this schedule. Considering there were a few delays<br />from the failed launch attempts in August and<br />early September, it makes the probability lower<br />that the launch will actually follow through this<br />time.","Andrew Decker (60%): As of the 20th, the rcp polls<br />have to race at a tie. I would say the Warnock<br />has an advantage as he is an incumbent but I could<br />see Herschel winning too. I think the way this<br />election comes out is going to reflect how the<br />national elections turn out too.","Andrew Decker (30%): As of today the Braves are<br />back 2 games. As much as I want the braves to<br />win the division, I think the Mets have an easier<br />schedule remaining than the Braves. The Mets play<br />the Brewers(decent team), A's (horrible), Marlins<br />(bad), the Braves, and the Nats (bad). The Braves<br />play the Nats (bad), Phillies (good), Mets, and<br />the Marlins(bad). I think that if the Braves want<br />to win their division, they have to win both the<br />Mets and Phillies series. I think overall that the<br />Mets have a better chance at winning the division.","Andrew Decker (100%): According to Nasa, they are<br />planning to launch on Sept 27. Even if the launch<br />is delayed, I couldn't imagine them delaying<br />it for 2 months at this stage in the process.<br />Although the administrator of Nasa said that they<br />are in no rush, I believe that they will try to<br />get the rocket off by Nov 30.","Joe Ornstein (55%): The most recent polls of this<br />race are pretty mixed. About half show Warnock<br />with a substantial lead, and half show Walker<br />with a slight lead. Over the past six years,<br />polls of races like these have been slightly<br />biased towards Democrats, as Republicans have,<br />for one reason or another, become less willing to<br />talk with pollsters. The polling firms have made<br />efforts to deal with this, but between a possible<br />bias towards Democrats, and the high variance<br />of state-level polls, I'd say there's a lot of<br />uncertainty in this race. Both the 538 poll-based<br />models and prediction markets like Predictit and<br />Metaculus put Warnock at a 55% chance of winning<br />right now, so that's what I'm going with.","Joe Ornstein (35%): The Braves and the Mets are<br />two of the best teams in the MLB this year, and<br />right now the Braves are two games behind the<br />Mets to win NL East. There are 15 games left in<br />the regular season, and by my reckoning the Mets<br />have an weaker set of teams left to play in their<br />schedule than the Braves (Oakland and Milwaukee<br />compared to Philly and Washington). The Vegas<br />moneyline right now puts the Mets at roughly<br />2-to-1 odds of winning NL East.","Joe Ornstein (85%): Because Artemis I is going<br />to the moon, there are only a certain number of<br />\"launch windows\" when the moon's orbit will be<br />in the right place. They are being tremendously<br />cautious, having already scrubbed two missions due<br />to faulty sensors and leaky valves. But there are,<br />as best as I can tell, still three launch windows<br />remaining before the end of the semester. Even if<br />NASA scrubs 50% of its missions (a number of found<br />thrown out on some website), three launch windows<br />means a 87.5% chance that Artemis will launch<br />during one of those windows."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.23000000000000001,0.17000000000000001],"y":[1.965865975432098,0.99770924081094559],"text":["Class

The process of re-joining the<br />steel is a very complicated and long process and<br />is continuing to be up for debate. Biden wants to<br />rejoin the deal but only if I ran comes back into<br />compliance.","Joseph kennedy (25%): Accoridng to many news<br />articles on this topic, almost all of them agree<br />that the US will not join the nuclear deal.<br />Although I am basing this decesion off the publics<br />opinion, I think I can agree it's not very likley<br />the US will get in on this deal.","Jeremy Lee (20%): - Since the midterm elections<br />are coming up, Biden won't do anything that could<br />change the course for the democratic party -<br />Although both countries want to rejoin the deal,<br />neither of them have been taking any actions to<br />make it happen","Patrick Egan (30%): Both the US and Iran claim to<br />be interested, but they have struggled to reach an<br />agreement. Due to recent protests and civil unrest<br />in Iran, I don't believe a plan will come to be by<br />the end of the semester.","David Barrero (5%): There have been talks about<br />the Iran Nuclear Deal since April of last year<br />and yet no consensus has been agreed upon. During<br />this time for the rest of the semester there is an<br />increase in focus on the midterms which will most<br />likely slow down the already slow talks about the<br />US rejoining the deal. The President and his party<br />might also not want to have made a decision until<br />after the elections for there not to have any<br />consequences on the party of the President. This<br />leaves little time for the deal to be discussed<br />about and resolved.","Joe Ornstein (10%): Once again, a situation that<br />has changed dramatically since we posted the<br />question. Even before the latest protests, there<br />was little sign that US and Iranian diplomats<br />were engaging constructively on this question, and<br />now that the Iranian regime is shooting civilians<br />in the streets I give a 0% chance that the Biden<br />administration lifts sanctions by December. The<br />only way I see this question resolving to Yes is<br />if the protests result in the Islamic Republic's<br />collapse, and the Biden administration lifts<br />sanctions on an interim government. That's a<br />pretty quick timeline, though.","Arianna Ycaza (15%): No, because with the midterm<br />elections coming up in early November, Biden is<br />not likely to take action on the Iran Nuclear<br />Deal so that he is able to appeal to moderate<br />voters and Republicans who do not support the<br />Iran Nuclear Deal. If he were to rejoin the Iran<br />Nuclear Deal between the midterm election and<br />November 30, that would cause a lot of controversy<br />and would cause his ratings to plummet.","audrey vaughan (55%): Mohammad Morandi, the<br />Iranian team negotiating team adviser, said in<br />august that they are closer than they've been<br />before to securing a deal with the US. Biden<br />has also sought to rejoin the deal, however,<br />the Israeli prime minster said that he will do<br />whatever it takes for Israel to not be apart of<br />the agreement, which could play an effect on the<br />US's decision to join.","Nicholas Chao (0%): With lots of controversy<br />revolving around this decision and people<br />questioning Biden's leadership, I believe he<br />would not do something so major. Midterms are<br />also coming up and this could seriously affect the<br />democratic party.","Olivia West (30%): I don't think there is a chance<br />that the US will re-enter the deal given how<br />inconsistent they have been, going from nearly<br />certain in March to almost zero chances in July,<br />then back in the direction of an agreement in<br />August to yet another deadlock in September.","Andrew Decker (50%): I think it could go either<br />way on the US rejoining the accords. Recently,<br />Iran has called on the US to come to the table<br />and discuss the deal. Some say that it is now<br />or never to seal the deal. Biden has indicated<br />that he wants to rejoin but he will have to get<br />it done very soon. Some also say that at this<br />point the deal would be practically worthless as<br />Iran already has sufficient materials to create a<br />nuclear weapon.","Noah Herndon (15%): I gave it a small probability<br />because the government works really slow, and<br />even if Biden does want to rejoin the Iran Nuclear<br />Deal, I think it would take a long time and<br />not be completed by November 30th. Also, it is<br />election season, so Biden probably doesn't want<br />to do anything controversial that would affect the<br />midterm elections. Also, Iran really doesn't want<br />the U.S. to rejoin the Nuclear Deal, and if both<br />sides aren't backing it, I don't see it happening.","Hannah Jones (4%): Biden wants to rejoin yes, but<br />i do not believe that will happen before the end<br />of the semester. That is super fast and would need<br />more time. Also, the agreement would only happen<br />if Iran comes back to compliance which will not<br />happen anytime soon.","Edward Cox (15%): Our former president royally<br />pissed them off. They want nothing to do with us<br />and with the Ukraine war going on, this is not our<br />most pressing issue at the moment.","Adam Szczupak (5%): There are much more pressing<br />issues on Biden’s agenda and flip flopping of<br />foreign policy between presidents does not set<br />a good historical precedent. However, Biden<br />did rejoin the Paris climate accord after trump<br />announced the US leaving during his term.","mac kinnebrew (30%): I do not think it is likely,<br />but Biden also wants to rejoin. I think he will<br />not rejoin because of the worry of backlash from<br />the US and other countries.","Ian Driggers (70%): I think that it will happen<br />before the elections in November 8th"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.40000000000000002,0.75,0.59999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,0.65000000000000002,1,0.65000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.79000000000000004,0.16,0.29999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.65000000000000002,0.69999999999999996,0.40000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.80000000000000004,0.56000000000000005,0.34999999999999998,0.25,0.59999999999999998,0.5,0.20000000000000001,0.94999999999999996,0.40000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.40000000000000002,1,1,0.69999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.80000000000000004,0.69999999999999996,0.69999999999999996,0.69999999999999996,0.69999999999999996,0.34999999999999998,0.59999999999999998,0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.80000000000000004,0.5,0.94999999999999996,0.96999999999999997,0.47999999999999998,0.14999999999999999,0.98999999999999999,0.84999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.78000000000000003,0.11,0.029999999999999999,0.58999999999999997,0.59999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.34999999999999998,0.69999999999999996,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.34999999999999998,0.40000000000000002],"y":[3.0359973506536333,0.95845935905817892,3.9567703495034947,2.0228194633265959,2.9608369522728024,0.98860159229952838,4.0317101161926985,1.9758656758349389,3.007627045828849,0.98536077539902178,4.0411295641679317,1.9834394792327656,3.0356494185049088,1.0085517535218969,3.9659478868125007,1.9755267312051727,3.0491628075484187,0.9748009559232742,3.9998982181772589,2.0418088997714223,3.0290044951951129,1.0417837644461543,4.0157084041042257,1.9931020124582575,3.0078037125291304,0.9913073862204328,3.9871791769284757,2.0281008780002594,2.9678770229686053,1.0072500948561356,4.0031654993537815,2.0499416384613141,3.0184115981683135,1.0299045749707147,4.0033152777934449,1.9953228436643258,3.0316064152866602,1.0136274554999545,3.9703884886577727,2.0090220445534213,2.9593178746988995,0.99291124974843115,3.9965651167090983,1.9730803892016411,2.951918368600309,0.96829386160243303,3.9878622928401457,2.0269560081418603,3.0330413384595887,0.95934403322171424,4.045092705124989,1.9606395755894481,3.0354483770905061,1.0390338229946792,4.035678145242855,1.9577203025342897,3.0363776874262838,0.99306964688003063,3.9747897809604185,2.0242193855345247,2.9520773701369762,1.006328733288683,4.031926752440631,1.9781284326920285,2.9852829012321309,1.0053775003412739,3.9687857046024875,1.9535421464126557],"text":["Meredith Stevens (40%): It is unlikely because<br />currently the Democrat party takes up the majority<br />of the seats in the house with 222 Democrats<br />versus only 212 Republicans.

To add, she already can<br />dance a bit, which I think can help her in the<br />end.","Joseph kennedy (100%): If I read this question<br />correctly, the inflation rate of September 2022<br />according to multiple sources was 8.3%. As we are<br />in september 2022 currently, I think it's 100%<br />positive that this will happen.","Joseph kennedy (65%): There are 16/29 marvel<br />movies that have a minumum rotten tomatoes score<br />of 85%. It is a 50-50 shot that this movie will<br />be higher than 85% on rotton tomatoes. However,<br />what is leading me towards the \"yes\" side is that<br />fact that the marvel movie with the highest rottom<br />tomateos score is the og black panther, so I think<br />fans and critics will both like this movie too.","Jeremy Lee (90%): - Often during the midterm<br />elections, the opposite party of the president<br />takes over the House - Past trends have shown that<br />the opposite party usually control the House","Jeremy Lee (85%): - Charli D'Amelio is well known<br />on TikTok because of her dancing - She has a large<br />fan base so she will most likely be able to get a<br />lot of votes","Jeremy Lee (65%): - It's hard to say because the<br />past trends show that after a peak of inflation,<br />the inflation rate either drops drastically after<br />a couple months or very slowly - The inflation<br />rate has been dropping around 0.5 each month since<br />the peak of inflation in June","Jeremy Lee (80%): - Black Panther Wakanda Forever<br />has high anticipation and believe a lot of people<br />will like the movie especially since the first one<br />was so successful - The director of the movie, 5<br />out of 7 of his movies have been 85% or higher on<br />rotten tomato score, one of them being the first<br />Black Panther","Patrick Egan (79%): FiveThirtyEight said there was<br />a 69% chance, and I added 10 because the current<br />president is Democratic and usually the opposite<br />party does better in these types of elections.","Patrick Egan (16%): I have never seen dancing with<br />the stars. Looking at the list of competitors and<br />what people have to say about them, it appears<br />only 6 dancers have a chance of winning, 1 of<br />which being Charli. So she gets a 1/6 chance I<br />guess.","Patrick Egan (30%): The 10 year yield rate<br />continues to rise, but relative to the historical<br />relationship with core consumer inflation, the<br />current 10 year yield rate still looks low, which<br />implies 1) inflation will fall, 2) the 10 year<br />yield will rise, or 3) a bit of both. I'm hoping<br />for both I guess.","Patrick Egan (85%): The new Doctor Strange<br />apparently got an 85% or Rotten Tomatoes, so I<br />guess anything is possible...","David Barrero (65%): The President's party in most<br />midterms loses the most seats and it seems to be<br />projected the same this year, but there has been<br />a decrease separation in the polls making it a<br />bit more close. There also have been redistricting<br />which have taken democrats out of some seats.","David Barrero (70%): Charli D'Amelio seems to<br />be one of the favorites to win Dancing with the<br />Stars. Her dancing background along with her fame<br />on tiktok has her moved up in the power rankings<br />for either a top challenger or favorite to win it<br />all. Her partner is also very well liked and has a<br />lot of experience and skill.","David Barrero (40%): The US inflation rate has<br />been greater than 8% for the past 6 months but<br />in the previous 4 months the inflation rate has<br />started to fall with an average of about .35 %<br />and the inflation rate is usually under 8%. The<br />inflation rate for August was about 8.3-8.26%<br />which means if it drops around .35% the inflation<br />rate will be under 8%","David Barrero (85%): The new Black Panther<br />will get an audience score above 85% because it<br />has been in the works for a long time and the<br />anticipation for the movie has been very high.<br />The recent passing of Chadwick Boseman will have<br />a huge impact as this movie is going to honor<br />him and he was a huge inspiration for many people<br />as well as being well liked. Comparing it to big<br />action movies the audience scores have been high<br />this year and are usually higher than the rotten<br />tomato scores.","Joe Ornstein (80%): The president's party has<br />lost House seats in every midterm except one since<br />WWII. The exception was after 9/11, when GWB's<br />approval ratings were in the mid-60s. (Biden is<br />in no such position.) Given Democrats' razor thin<br />margins in the House, they cannot afford to lose<br />more than a handful of seats without losing the<br />majority. I'm only moderating my near-certainty of<br />a GOP majority because poll aggregators like 538<br />and prediction markets like PredictIt are posting<br />odds between 70-78%. Perhaps the backlash to<br />SCOTUS decisions is enough to mobilize Democratic<br />voters and save all those seats, but I strongly<br />doubt it.","Joe Ornstein (56%): As an Elder Millennial, I'm<br />pretty baffled by TikTok influencers, but my<br />impression from watching some Charli videos is<br />that she can, in fact, dance. This puts her at<br />an advantage over many of the other stars cast on<br />DWTS. In the first two episodes, Charli and Mark<br />scored higher than any other pair, which turns out<br />to be a pretty predictive indicator of success!<br />Over the past 30 seasons of the show, the eventual<br />winner was the Weeks 1+2 leader 56% of the time.<br />Also, Charli's partner is Mark Ballas, a two-time<br />winner of the mirror ball. The only pro with more<br />1st place wins is Derek Hough, who is a judge this<br />season.","Joe Ornstein (35%): I suspect it will be lower<br />this month than last month, but I don't hold this<br />belief very strongly. With gas prices decreasing,<br />and home prices leveling out amid recession fears,<br />the largest components of the CPI are set to bring<br />down the headline inflation rate. Economists'<br />forecasts are optimistic about the coming month's<br />inflation numbers. But they were optimistic about<br />last month's numbers too, so I'm not sure what to<br />think about that.","Joe Ornstein (25%): Looking at the Marvel<br />Cinematic Universe sequels, only 2/8 had a<br />higher Rotten Tomatoes audience score than the<br />first film. Pleasing fans with sequels is tough,<br />especially if the first movie was as well-received<br />as Black Panther. On top of that you have the<br />tragic loss of Chadwick Boseman, who really<br />powered the first film. While it's certainly<br />possible that Wakanda Forever will win over more<br />fans than the original, I wouldn't bet on it.","Arianna Ycaza (60%): The midterm elections tend<br />to be when the popularity of the party of the<br />president sees a decline, since the current<br />president is a Democrat we can also expect for<br />more Republicans to vote and flip the house.<br />However, I have not seen any predictions that<br />express that Republicans are 100% going to flip<br />the house, so I only put it at a little over 50%.","Arianna Ycaza (50%): Last week on DWTS, Charli<br />D'Amelio and her partner got the highest points<br />out of all the couples. She's clearly doing very<br />well due to her knowledge of dance technique and<br />experience, however this is still an entertainment<br />program and I think viewers will not want to see<br />the expected winner (Charli) to win in the end.","Arianna Ycaza (20%): Based on the CPI for<br />September that was released and influence by<br />August 2022 data, the September U.S. inflation<br />rate is supposed to come in around 8.3%. However,<br />this data causes Seeking Alpha to predict that the<br />end of year inflation rate in the U.S. will end<br />up to be around 4%, which shows that the inflation<br />rate is going to be decreasing through September<br />and into December. This makes me think that the<br />inflation rate for September will come in at a<br />under 8%, even if it's 7.5%+.","Arianna Ycaza (95%): I think the movie will get<br />an audience score above 86% on Rotten Tomatoes<br />considering the original film brought in almost<br />a perfect audience approval score of 96%, as well<br />as over $700million in the box office. Marvel fans<br />are very loyal and I predict that the new Black<br />Panther movie will see similar ratings.","audrey vaughan (40%): Newsweek says that Democrats<br />are closing in on the lead that the GOP had<br />maintained with voters for several months and<br />a poll showed that Democrats have a nearly 1<br />point lead over Republicans. along with this, the<br />overturning of roe v wade will have a big impact<br />on this. Many people were very upset over this<br />and I believe it will encourage people to go and<br />vote and could result in the democrats having the<br />majority seats.","audrey vaughan (20%): although Charli D'Amelio<br />is a very famous person and has a background in<br />dancing, dancing with the stars is a show with<br />an older audience. That being said, chari is<br />more famous among a younger crowd that doesn't<br />watch the show that often. The shows winning is<br />voted on by the public and those watching, so if<br />the audience watching does know who she is, she<br />probably wont win. the style of dance that charli<br />has done before is very different from the dances<br />that they do on the show, so that will give her a<br />disadvantage because she will be trying to learn a<br />very different style.","audrey vaughan (80%): over the past 12 months<br />prior to August it has been above 8%, so there<br />is a very likely chance that this pattern will<br />continue. Although it has been high, it's been<br />starting to go down so theres a slight chance<br />that it will drop below 8%, but it's very unlikely<br />because of the state of our economy and rising<br />inflation over the past several months.","audrey vaughan (90%): the first black panther<br />movie got a 96 on rotten tomato's was was<br />extremely popular and good so i believe that it<br />will. along with this, the new movie is produced<br />by the same director and has many of the same<br />starring actors.","Nicholas Chao (40%): It's pretty even right now<br />and anything could happen before November 8th.<br />But, the Democrats will most likely keep their<br />majority in the senate. With Biden's approval<br />ratings also rising slowly, this will also aid the<br />party.","Nicholas Chao (100%): Her popularity and high<br />follower count gives her a slight edge on the<br />other contestants on reality TV. She also has had<br />the highest scores on her debut performance.","Nicholas Chao (100%): The trend spiked around<br />mid-to-early 2021 and does not seem to come down<br />anytime soon. Even if it does, I do not believe it<br />will before next month.","Nicholas Chao (70%): I believe that Marvel has<br />seen that their recent movies have not done so<br />well from all the jokingness and veering from the<br />main plot. They will step in a different direction<br />with this new Black Panther. The first Black<br />Panther also has the highest rotten tomatoes of<br />all Marvel movies, so they will try to preserve<br />their greatness and they will also have to honor<br />Chadwick.","Olivia West (20%): Considering after the<br />Democratic Party took over the White House<br />in the 2020 election, I think there is a slim<br />to no chance that the Republican Party will<br />win a majority of seats in the US House of<br />Representatives on November 8. Additionally, the<br />Democrats kept control of the U.S. House after<br />gaining 222 seats to the Republicans' 213 in<br />2020. Democrats currently hold a 221-212 edge in<br />the U.S. House, which has two vacancies, as of<br />September 20, 2022, making the chances even lower<br />that the republicans will win .","Olivia West (60%): I think that Charli D'Amelio<br />and her dance partner have a fairly high chance<br />of winning dancing with the stars considering<br />Charli's amount of fame. Despite her being a great<br />dancer, she has over 100 million followers on<br />social media, giving her a strong lead way against<br />her competitors.","Olivia West (80%): The US inflation rate has<br />slightly dropped since June from 8.9% to 8.2% in<br />August. Considering that it has dropped not even<br />a whole percent within 3 months, I think there is<br />a very high chance that the US inflation rate will<br />still be above 8% in September 2022.","Olivia West (70%): Considering the first Black<br />Panther received 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, I think<br />there is a fairly high chance that the second<br />one will score above 85%. Also, there is a $200<br />million budget for this movie, averaging way<br />higher for its production than most other movies.","Andrew Decker (70%): 538 shows that the<br />republicans have around a 70 percent chance. It<br />is also statistically more likely for the party no<br />in the presidency to win more seats in the house<br />during the midterms.","Andrew Decker (70%): I do not know much about<br />Charli D'Amelio or Dancing with the Stars. I<br />do know that Charli has a background in dance<br />which I'm sure is helpful in a celebrity dance<br />competition. Also, apparently her debut dance<br />received very high scores so I think she has a<br />good chance of winning.","Andrew Decker (70%): It has been above 8 percent<br />since March and I do not think much has improved<br />so I think it is likely that it stays above 8<br />percent. I also think the recent market issues may<br />indicate a higher inflation rate.","Andrew Decker (35%): The first black panther<br />did not get above 80 percent on RT. Generally,<br />sequels are not received as well so I doubt that<br />the new BP will receive higher ratings. The only<br />thing keeping my prediction up is that I think<br />people will flock to the movie as it is Chadwick<br />Boseman's final film before his passing. That<br />factor might contribute to a higher score.","Noah Herndon (60%): Although democrats have a<br />majority seats in the US House of Representatives,<br />the opposing party of the party of the president<br />usually gains majority in the house. Also,<br />redistricting has caused some democrats seats to<br />be out of reach. I think it will be close, but I<br />do think Republicans will gain a majority of the<br />seats which is why I gave them a 60% chance to win<br />a majority of the seats.","Noah Herndon (75%): I did some quick research<br />on Dancing With the Stars because I have little<br />knowledge of it. Since it is a show about<br />celebrities competing in dance competitions, I<br />do think that Charlie Damilio has the upper hand<br />which is why I gave her a 75% chance to win.<br />Charlie was a professional dancer before TikTok<br />so if she is competing against people that don't<br />usually dance, I think she has a good chance of<br />winning. She also has a really big fanbase and<br />due to the decline of views and ratings of Dancing<br />With the Stars, the show could use someone with<br />a big fanbase to win in order to increase ratings<br />and views which is another reason I gave her a 75%<br />chance of winning.","Noah Herndon (30%): I don't think that the US<br />inflation rate will be greater than 8% because the<br />inflation rate has already begun to fall in July<br />and August and I think it will have continued to<br />fall in September. Gas prices have only gotten<br />cheaper this past month and since gas has a large<br />influence over inflation, I think it is safe to<br />assume that the inflation rate is less than 8%.<br />Also, the inflation rate fell by approximately<br />.24 from July to August and if it were to fall by<br />approximately that same amount in September, the<br />inflation rate would be below 8% or really close.","Noah Herndon (80%): Approximately 60% of Marvel<br />movies have an audience score above 85% on Rotten<br />Tomatoes which already bodes well for Black<br />Panther being above 85%. Another reason why I put<br />it at 80% is because this is going to be a very<br />heartfelt movie that is a love letter to Chadwick<br />Boseman. Marvel has had a couple of misses lately,<br />but I really think that they will get this one<br />right. Additionally, just based off the trailers,<br />it looks like it's going to be an amazing movie!","Hannah Jones (50%): Republicans are focusing on<br />the economy in most of their campaigns which wins<br />many people over. Yet, democrats are focusing<br />on more human rights such as abortion which will<br />pull other people. I think this is very 50/50<br />considering both sides have vastly different<br />focuses.","Hannah Jones (95%): Charli is already a dancer.<br />Her fans will go out of their way to vote for her<br />because the millions of followers she has wants<br />her to win.","Hannah Jones (97%): The inflation rate was 8.24<br />in August. Since not much has changed since then<br />i believe that it will hover right above 8. Not<br />only that but the past few months have had similar<br />patterns.","Hannah Jones (48%): The first Black Panther had<br />a score of 79%, typically the original is always<br />the best. Therefore this movie will probably get<br />a lower score. Also, the actor who played black<br />panther, Chadwick Boseman passed away. I think<br />more fans will go because he will be honored int<br />he movie which may up the audience score.","Edward Cox (15%): Often, the house stays with<br />the presidency and since there is a democratic<br />president in office, it is likely it will stay.<br />Also, over the past few years, the house has had a<br />majority of democratic seats so it is likely that<br />it will not change.","Edward Cox (99%): Because she has such a large<br />fan base and she is a pretty good dancer, she will<br />probably win.","Edward Cox (85%): I think it is very likely that<br />it will because looking at the last 10 years<br />or so, the rate of inflation is about equal to<br />august every year. It does not seem to differ too<br />much. It would need to be a significant drop and<br />something major would have to happen for it not to<br />be over 8%.","Edward Cox (90%): I am pretty positive because<br />it is so highly anticipated and it is directed<br />by Ryan Coogler, it will probably do very well.<br />Almost all of Ryan Coogler’s movies he has<br />directed has made over an 85 rotten tomatoes<br />score.","Adam Szczupak (78%): The opposing party to the<br />presidency usually gains the majority in the House<br />of Representatives, especially when the president<br />is unpopular such as the case with joe Biden.<br />However, the changing demographics in the American<br />landscape does favor the democrats.","Adam Szczupak (11%): Although Charli D’Amelio has<br />a track record of being a dancer, she specializes<br />in an entirely different style of dance. Moreover,<br />dancing with the stars is a extremely competitive<br />competition with professional dancers that train<br />for years. Nevertheless, she is very popular and<br />might do well with the fan vote and is undeniably<br />talented.","Adam Szczupak (3%): The fed raised interest rates<br />by 75 basis points, so if inflation is above 8<br />percent, it would be EXTREMELY bad. That would<br />signify an undeniable recession that would result<br />in terrible stagnation. However inflation was just<br />8.3% so it wouldn’t be unprecedented.","Adam Szczupak (59%): The fact that Chadwick<br />boseman passed away helps the positive perception<br />of the movie. Also, it is a high budget film with<br />a great cultural impact. Nonetheless, 85 percent<br />positive reception is hard to achieve, especially<br />with a highly anticipated film.","mac kinnebrew (60%): Democrats are in the White<br />house right now so people are more likely to be<br />more upset with them. The Republicans also only<br />need to flip one seat.","mac kinnebrew (20%): Charli is a great dancer and<br />so is her partner, but the show is full of great<br />dancers. This is a very hard thing to win.","mac kinnebrew (35%): The trend recently has been<br />that inflation is going down. The inflation rate<br />only needs to go down .2 to be lower than 8%.","mac kinnebrew (70%): I think it will because the<br />first movie was rated a 96. These types of super<br />hero movies and their sequels tend to do well.","Ian Driggers (30%): Even though the senate usually<br />loses seats of the party of the president, more<br />democrats are favored to win.","Ian Driggers (20%): I think that Charli damelio is<br />on dancing w the stars for a publicity thing but I<br />don’t think that she will win.","Ian Driggers (35%): I think that the inflation<br />rate will be less than 8% because the fed has been<br />working to drive it down and I have faith","Ian Driggers (40%): I think the new movie will<br />have an audience score around 75% so I am saying<br />less probability"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.23999999999999999],"y":[4.9862983816768978],"text":"Class

I<br />noticed this trend on the bloomebreg government<br />website, and during majority of midterm senate<br />elections, this trend occurs.","Joseph Kennedy (20%): This album has been<br />confirmed by travis to be his next studio album<br />since 2021, and still this album hasn't been<br />released. It was originally said to be released<br />in June, 2022, but following the incident at the<br />concert, plans for the album slowed down. Now it<br />is October 2022, and although rumors have that<br />this album will be released later this year, it<br />seems less and less likley as the year continues.<br />Travis still has UTOPIA in his instagram bio,<br />which shows the album is coming, but he hasn't<br />made a post about the album in a long time which<br />leads me to thinking this album will not come by<br />December 1st.","Joseph Kennedy (70%): I do not know much about<br />the israel prime minister election, but what I did<br />find was that he seems to be leading the way in<br />predictions. I do not know how hard it is to be<br />reelected in Israel, but it seems likely he will.","Joseph Kennedy (55%): I think that there will<br />defiently be a turkey shortage this thanksgiving<br />due to the bird flu causing shortages. The<br />only thing that prevents me from putting this<br />probbalitiy higher is that I am unfamiliar with<br />frozen trukey prices per pound. On multiple<br />sources, it says the price per pound sits around<br />$2 dollars at the moment, so I do not know how<br />much higher these prices will get up to this<br />thanksgiving.","Meredith Stevens (60%): 1) most likely yes<br />because the Democratic Party holds the power in<br />the presidency. 2) history has shown that the<br />opposite party from the presidency will hold<br />majority of seats in the house. Therefore as<br />Biden as president they will more likely be more<br />Republicans in the house.","Meredith Stevens (30%): 1) some website states<br />that it will be released around June. 2)<br />especially after facing the tragic incidents<br />of AstroWorld I think he will be more delayed<br />releasing new music.","Meredith Stevens (20%): 1) Currently he’s not the<br />prime Minister and it will be hard for him to take<br />over the spot of Yair Lapid 2) he also has already<br />been Prime Minister therefore not making it likely<br />for him to be one again.","Meredith Stevens (20%): 1) most likely not because<br />this is a national holiday that many people prep<br />for and companies know to provide for. 2) there<br />shouldn’t be a turkey shortage but there can<br />possibly be higher prices due to the demand.","Patrick Egan (31%): I don't keep up with politics,<br />but I do trust fivethirtyeight with my life, and<br />if they say the democrats will win, then they will<br />win. Surely.","Patrick Egan (2%): Travis Scott is currently<br />in Nevada for a concert residency called \"Road<br />to Utopia\" at Resorts World Las Vegas' Zouk<br />Nightclub. The residency is set to consist of<br />seven shows, though only two performance dates<br />have been announced so far: Sept. 17 and Oct. 15.<br />Given the gap between these 2 performances, the<br />fact that a 3rd of the 7 hasn't been announced,<br />and the assumption that he will not release the<br />album until after these 7 shows, its safe to<br />assume we won't see Utopia drop until 2023.","Patrick Egan (74%): I know nothing of Israel<br />politics. I do know Netanyahu is the incumbent,<br />and that he has served as prime minister since<br />2009. I also know Netanyahu is right leaning<br />(probably), as he has advocated for the free<br />market and believes in the tightening of<br />immigration laws. Given that a very right-leaning<br />candidate just won an election in Italy, Israel<br />might follow suit. idk tho israel is weird.","Patrick Egan (65%): I asked an expert: My mom.<br />She said there was about a 65% chance of this<br />happening.","Audrey Vaughan (20%): although Joe Biden doesn't<br />have great ratings, democrats still appear to be<br />favored and will keep control of the senate. polls<br />are suggesting that the democrats might even flip<br />seats in the senate. fivethirtyeight forecasts a<br />61-100 change of democrats controlling the senate<br />in the midterms.","Audrey Vaughan (90%): Travis has been saying it<br />will be dropped in 2022, and he's already been<br />dropping bits of the songs and details about the<br />album for months. there have already been delays<br />but as long as the album doesn't get leaked within<br />the next few weeks it will be dropped very soon.","Audrey Vaughan (45%): Israel's prime minister is<br />stepping down from position due to a change in<br />their government. Because of this, the countries<br />former leader, Netanyahu, is planning on returning<br />to power in the November election. Netanuahu<br />was the prime minter for 12 years prior, and its<br />still unclear whether he can return to power. His<br />prior governments relied on smaller right-wing<br />and religious groups, but he was unable to secure<br />sufficient support.","Audrey Vaughan (5%): grocery stores are well<br />prepared for big holidays such as thanksgiving and<br />will most likely not run out or go into a shortage<br />of turkey. Shortages typically only happen with<br />an unexpected event, and stores are aware of how<br />popular turkeys are during that time. Even with an<br />avain influenza outbreak for turkeys and chicken<br />in 2015 there was still not an effect on turkeys<br />during thanksgiving, so it would be very difficult<br />for there to be a shortage.","Nicholas Chao (80%): The usual way the senate<br />seats are chosen is by the current president. This<br />would make it more likely for the majority of the<br />seats to swing towards the Republican Party.","Nicholas Chao (50%): All the information that was<br />released regarding the album release date was that<br />it is going to get released this year. I think<br />that December is a bit too far for this album to<br />be released and will be before then.","Nicholas Chao (35%): He has already announced that<br />he would be stepping down. Sources also estimate<br />that elections will take place in October, meaning<br />the new prime minister should be in office before<br />11/30.","Nicholas Chao (35%): Turkeys are a staple for<br />Thanksgiving feasts and the food industry has been<br />preparing for this holiday for decades. It is also<br />very unlikely for the price to exceed over $3, but<br />be around $2.","Hannah Jones (70%): A lot of the time whichever<br />party the president is affiliated with, the senate<br />will have majority of the opposite party. The<br />polls are also super close so one cannot really<br />say who will win control confidently. I think the<br />republican party may take this one though because<br />the democratic party is losing some ground in some<br />states.","Hannah Jones (85%): He said his album would<br />release in 2022, so the chances of it being<br />between now and december are high. It would<br />also be good press for him to release before<br />everyone is concerned with more holiday related<br />things. December is typically centered around<br />religious holidays so it would be smart to release<br />beforehand.","Hannah Jones (60%): He is already said to be<br />plotting his return. He also has been their prime<br />minister for many years on and off. Many people do<br />not want him to be prime minister but he seems to<br />have overruling power in a way.","Hannah Jones (96%): More people will be travelling<br />for thanksgiving this year now that a lot of the<br />population is vaccinated against covid. The nation<br />also always runs into turkey shortages during the<br />holidays so the chances of it happening again are<br />very high. I also think that grocery stores make<br />a lot of profit off of this so they will continue<br />doing so.","Noah Herndon (40%): I turned to 538 to draw<br />inspiration for my probability. According to 538,<br />democrats are slightly favored to hold onto their<br />majority of seats. Out of 100 scenarios, democrats<br />win in 67 of those scenarios. Also republicans<br />only need to win one seat, democrats don't need to<br />win any to maintain a majority of seats. As long<br />as democrats, maintain what is there's, they will<br />have a majority which is why I gave republicans a<br />40% chance of gaining a majority of seats in the<br />Senate.","Noah Herndon (40%): I give it a 40% chance of<br />happening because Travis Scott said in a magazine<br />that Utopia would release this year, but Travis<br />Scott is also no newcomer to delays. His last<br />album, Astroworld, Travis Scott advertised in<br />concert, was going to release in 2017. But it<br />eventually released in August of 2018. I think it<br />could release this year, but I'm leaning toward it<br />not which is why I gave it a 40%.","Noah Herndon (20%): Netanyahu is coming fresh off<br />defeat against Lapid and the polls are already<br />saying he falls short of putting together a<br />government which is the same problem he faced in<br />his last three attempts. Also, President Biden<br />isn't a fan of Netanyahu and while the US isn't<br />supposed to interfere in foreign elections, that<br />doesn't mean they can't or that Biden's disproval<br />of Netanyahu won't have an effect.","Noah Herndon (20%): Butterball spokesperson said<br />that turkey availability \"will look largely the<br />same as last year and we anticipate having a<br />wide range of sizes available for both fresh and<br />frozen whole turkeys.\" They also said that there<br />have been no \"supply disruptions and there are<br />no measurable impacts on Butterball Thanksgiving<br />turkeys.\" In 2021, the average price of a Turkey<br />per pound was $1.36, so I find it really hard that<br />the average price of turkeys exceeding 3/lb or not<br />being available at all.","mac kinnebrew (55%): The Democrats have control<br />of the White House right now so people are more<br />likely to be more upset with them. It is close<br />though because right now it is currently 50/50.","mac kinnebrew (70%): Travis has many shows coming<br />up that he has hinted at the possibility of<br />dropping new music there. He has also showed a lot<br />of studio sessions so it is likely that the album<br />is finished.","mac kinnebrew (15%): He has already been Prime<br />minister so I doubt it happens again. Israel is<br />also very unpredictable during this time and they<br />just got a new prime minister in July.","mac kinnebrew (60%): This year nearly 6 million<br />turkeys died due to disease. Over the past could<br />years there also seems to be a shortage very<br />frequently.","Arianna Ycaza (55%): Democrats currently have<br />the presidency, which typically means that the<br />US Senate will be flipped to the party that<br />is not of the President during the midterm<br />election. However, most polls only predict that<br />the Republicans will only win by a small margin<br />--- most predicting only about 10 seats having<br />high likelihood to flip. So, I think it could go<br />either way with a very slight favor towards the<br />Republicans flipping the senate.","Arianna Ycaza (10%): Honestly, I have not heard<br />any news about this and when looking up expected<br />dates for the album release, it was entirely<br />speculation and fan theories. The only one factor<br />that would cause for me to think an album was<br />coming anytime before December 1st is that the<br />release of an album single being November 5th of<br />2021, which leads me to believe that the possible<br />album release could end up being on the one year<br />anniversary, being November 5th of this year.<br />However, I think one year is an extremely long<br />time to await an album and there are no confirmed<br />release dates so personally I do not think the<br />album is coming.","Arianna Ycaza (85%): I cannot find much on this,<br />however the Washington Post is writing that<br />Netanyahu is preparing for a comeback based on<br />data from polls being taken and current voting<br />patterns.","Arianna Ycaza (10%): Typically, the Monday before<br />Thanksgiving still allows for a couple of days<br />until the actual holiday, and the grocery stores<br />have some Turkeys still in stock.","Jeremy Lee (30%): - Polls show that the democrats<br />have a 67 in 100 chance to win the majority - Past<br />Congresses show that a majority of the senates<br />followed the party of the President","Jeremy Lee (75%): - He has confirmed in interviews<br />that he will definitely drop the album in 2022 -<br />All of the past albums/songs that he has released<br />were around the end of the year","Jeremy Lee (50%): - He seems to have a chance<br />at becoming Prime Minister again because of the<br />political problems occurring in Israel as well<br />as the support he's receiving from some people<br />- However, Netanyahu was ousted for bribery and<br />fraud, so I don't know if people would want him as<br />a leader","Jeremy Lee (10%): - The history of the price<br />of turkey on Thanksgiving in Athens was around<br />$1.50-$2 - I don't think that the prices in turkey<br />will be able to rise that drastically especially<br />when our economy has been recovering","Adam Szczupak (33%): FiveThirtyEight forecast<br />predicts this 33% chance.","Adam Szczupak (37%): The album has been teased<br />for over the past 2 years. But Travis has stated<br />that he has been experimenting with new sounds,<br />which takes more time to culminate into a full<br />album. Moreover, artists usually build up hype<br />by announcing an album beforehand, which Travis<br />hasn’t officially done, rather he keeps teasing<br />it, which gives it a solid chance, but the album<br />is obviously not done enough for official release<br />yet.","Adam Szczupak (53%): Polls right now indicate<br />that Netanyahu will win about 60-62 seats in the<br />Knesset, needing 61 to become prime minister. The<br />Israeli citizens are very divided on their opinion<br />of him and the likud party, so this election on<br />November 1st will be very close. I gave him a 3<br />percent edge due to his extremely long tenure as<br />prime minister previously.","Adam Szczupak (79%): According to USDA data,<br />turkey production is at an all time low; at the<br />same time, families are starting to hold big<br />gatherings post covid again. These forces coupled<br />with inflationary forces create a perfect storm<br />for a shortage of turkeys. Nonetheless, the<br />ample time for stores to prepare for thanksgiving<br />gives them a fighting chance to be well stocked,<br />although they could price gouge regardless.","David Barrero (55%): The Republican Party has<br />more Senate seats up for reelection than do<br />the Democrat Party which means that there is a<br />higher chance for majority seats because usually<br />incumbents win their seats back and of the two<br />parties the Republican Party has more red leaning<br />seats up for grabs than the Democrat Party that<br />has more competitive races.","David Barrero (65%): Travis has said that he was<br />going to drop the album in 2022, but has been<br />quiet for the last few months and there hasn't<br />been any new speculation on when this album will<br />be dropping. I am giving the probability above 50<br />because it is supposed to come out this year, but<br />not certain because the whole month of December is<br />left out.","David Barrero (70%): The recent poll in Israel<br />shows that Netanyahu has a slight advantage over<br />Lapid who has been the interim PM for the last<br />few months. Netanyahu has previously been Prime<br />Minister of Israel the longest lasting in its<br />history which gives him an advantage in experience<br />and voter recognition.","David Barrero (70%): There is a already a<br />shortage of turkeys because of the Influenza<br />that affected a lot of turkeys during the summer<br />months. Now with so many people wanting turkey for<br />Thanksgiving there won't be enough","Charlie Estabrook (53%): Most of the seats that<br />are up for grabs are going to be very close in the<br />elections. I think most Americans are very angry<br />after the last four years and it happened to be<br />that democrats were in control. It is probably not<br />the democrat's fault for any of this, it could've<br />happened the other way around. I think a lot of<br />Americans are going to flip republican.","Charlie Estabrook (43%): Travis Scott released<br />two singles on November 4, 2021 and the covert<br />art for those singles had a dystopian theme. He<br />could be releasing the rest of the album exactly<br />one year later. Travis Scott is notorious for<br />teasing music, putting out a release date, and not<br />dropping the music. For example he was saying, in<br />concert, that he was going that he was going to<br />release his album Astroworld a the end of 2016.<br />That album didn't come out until August 3, 2018.","Charlie Estabrook (73%): Netanyahu remains<br />popular in Israel. Recent conflict with Israel and<br />Palestine has become an important issue in Israel<br />politics and Netanyahu's stance is a popular<br />one. The Israel people are tired and want full<br />focus in restoring national pride. Netanyahu's<br />coalition has been making recent gains and there<br />are predictions for a whole turnout of Arab voters<br />which would help Netanyahu.","Charlie Estabrook (76%): I think there will be<br />Turkey's they are going to be expensive. Avian<br />Influenza is affecting turkey production. Regular<br />supply chain issues that we have been facing all<br />of the pandemic are still lingering and affecting<br />turkey production along with inflation. Turkey<br />production is down from around 4% from last year.","Olivia West (30%): Considering there is currently<br />a Democratically dominant house, there is a low<br />chance that the Republican Party will secure a<br />majority of seats in the US Senate. Also, the<br />United States currently has a Democratic President<br />and it will most likely influence the results of<br />the elections, making it even less likely that the<br />Republican Party will secure a majority of seats.","Olivia West (20%): Travis Scott, the famous<br />rapper, announced that he was going to release<br />his album \"Utopia\" in June of 2020. Considering<br />that it has been two years and the album has<br />not been released, I think there is a slim to<br />no chance that the album will be released before<br />December 1st. Also, Travis Scott has been late on<br />his previous album releases, making it even less<br />likely that he will release \"Utopia\" by December.","Olivia West (60%): Considering Benjamin Netanyahu<br />has served as the Prime Minister of Israel for<br />the past 15, I think there is a fairly high<br />chance that he will be reelected by the end of<br />the semester. Despite this, Netanyahu said that he<br />will step down from office this year, making the<br />probability slightly lower.","Olivia West (70%): Fox News reported that 2022<br />turkey output will be 5 percent below 2012 levels,<br />the lowest level in ten years, making it a very<br />high chance it will not improve by Thanksgiving.<br />Also, according to The Department of Agriculture,<br />after being exposed to Highly Pathogenic Avian<br />Influenza between January and July, the population<br />of turkeys decreased by around 6 million, making<br />the chance even higher that there will be a turkey<br />shortage.","Andrew Decker (40%): I think it will be close. 538<br />has it at a 1/3 chance for the GOP. Only reason I<br />go higher is the typical trend about non president<br />parties in midterms. I also saw that the GOP<br />gained more voters compared to Democrats.","Andrew Decker (15%): Travis Scott takes his time<br />with his albums and I bet he would rather drop<br />it at a better time in terms of sales. My guess<br />is that if he drop it this year, it will be right<br />before Christmas. If he drops it next year, it<br />will probably be right before summer.","Andrew Decker (60%): I do not know much about<br />Israeli government. I did look up the betting odds<br />and they have him at a 50 percent chance to win.<br />I also saw that his party has made gains in recent<br />weeks in terms of seats in parliament.","Andrew Decker (90%): I feel like there is a turkey<br />shortage every year. With Covid and supply chain<br />issues already hurting the meat industry, I think<br />this year will have a major Turkey shortage. I<br />also read that there was a virus that killed 6<br />millions US turkeys recently. Butterball said<br />that they do not expect the virus to slow down<br />distribution but I think that this might be smoke<br />coming from higher ups.","Edward Cox (75%): It’s unlikely to win majority.<br />Look at fivethirtyeight","Edward Cox (60%): I have no clue. There really<br />isn’t a whole lot of information about this","Edward Cox (70%): No idea but I’m going to say<br />yes because he has the most support right now and<br />last year the elections were held on the 11th of<br />November.","Edward Cox (80%): I’m really not sure. But imma<br />buy 80 bc I feel like I have to choose And there<br />are a lot of sources saying there will be a bird<br />shortage due to the avian flu.","Joe Ornstein (38%): Unlike the House, where<br />midterm backlash / GOP structural advantages give<br />Republicans a strong chance of winning a majority,<br />in the Senate the Democrats have a somewhat more<br />favorable map, and Republicans nominated a few<br />candidates with personal liabilities that could<br />cost them otherwise winnable races, like Oz in<br />Pennsylvania and Walker in Georgia. To hold on<br />to 50 seats, Democrats need to win both of those<br />races (GA and PA) or they can lose one and make<br />up for it by winning Nevada. There are other less<br />likely paths, but those are the most likely paths<br />to a majority. At the moment, Democrats lead the<br />polls in both those races, but by a margin that is<br />well-within historical polling error, particularly<br />given the recent bias in state-level polls towards<br />Democrats. Prediction markets give Republicans a<br />43% chance of winning a majority, and 538 gives<br />them a 33% chance. I'll split the difference<br />between those two.","Joe Ornstein (59%): This has been the subject of<br />a lot of Kremlinology, e.g. looking for secret<br />messages in Kylie Jenner instagram posts, but<br />it's difficult to find any real information on<br />the topic. Outside View: Scott announced that<br />the album would drop in 2022, and his albums<br />always drop on Fridays to maximize plays for the<br />Billboard charts. There are 13 Fridays left in<br />2022 and 8 of those are before December, so 8/13<br />= 61.5%. Inside View: When's the best Friday<br />to drop an album? Well, I found this article<br />looking at data from 2019 really illuminating:<br />https://amberhorsburgh.medium.com/what-2019-album-releases-can-teach-us-about-2020-planning-1092554c019a.<br />If you want to maximize your streams, avoid<br />releasing the same day as Taylor Swift (Midnights<br />scheduled to drop October 21) and avoid major<br />holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also,<br />I see that Scott has a \"Road To Utopia\" show in<br />Vegas on October 15, so I'm guessing he won't<br />release Utopia before the Road to Utopia is over?<br />I dunno. Grasping at straws. That leaves 4 Fridays<br />out of 7 viable options, or 57%","Joe Ornstein (15%): Israel is a parliamentary<br />system in the 120-seat Knesset is elected by<br />proportional representation. To become prime<br />minister, one must secure the support of 61 votes<br />in the Knesset following the November 1 election.<br />Neither left-wing nor right-wing party alliances<br />are likely to secure an outright majority of<br />seats, which suggests a protracted period of<br />coalition bargaining, or even a new election,<br />as happened in 2019. In either case, Netanyahu,<br />even if he eventually becomes Prime Minister,<br />would not do so before December 1. If the polls<br />are significantly understating Likud's strength<br />(by, say, 10 seats), then Netanyahu could quickly<br />secure coalition partners and form a government,<br />but I consider that unlikely, given the ongoing<br />corruption trial.","Joe Ornstein (5%): There are two factors driving<br />price increases in turkey this Thanksgiving:<br />general price inflation for food and an avian<br />flu epidemic that is killing millions of turkeys<br />across the country. Will those factors be<br />enough to drive prices above $3/lb for a frozen<br />Butterball? Price inflation for food is somewhere<br />in the neighborhood of 10% annually right now,<br />and the average price for a turkey in the US over<br />the past decade has been about $1.40. So inflation<br />alone brings us to an expected $1.54. The avian<br />flu would have to double the price of turkey above<br />an beyond ordinary inflation to reach $3. There's<br />*some* evidence that we've seen price spikes that<br />large for boneless skinless breast meat, but I<br />can't find good data on whole frozen turkeys.<br />Despite 6 million turkeys dying from avian flu,<br />it's a small share of the 250 million turkeys<br />that are slaughtered each year in the US. What<br />industry projections I could find suggest that<br />we're looking at a price of $1.76 per pound this<br />year, which is well above the historical average,<br />but nowhere near $3."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.65000000000000002,0.5,0.65000000000000002,0.29999999999999999,0.29999999999999999,0.56999999999999995,0.69999999999999996,0.75,0.84999999999999998,0.29999999999999999,0.5,0.69999999999999996,0.67000000000000004,0.5,0.69999999999999996,0.80000000000000004,0.55000000000000004],"y":[3.0166746384464203,3.0089592145755888,2.9541915620677175,2.9869293782860042,3.0368571683764456,2.9601259757764637,2.9526280176825823,3.0487219020957128,3.027798245009035,3.0498153192456812,3.0304230368928984,2.9775834491476418,3.0063205989776178,3.0210732385050507,2.9885822618380189,2.9866189419524742,3.0321232708869501],"text":["Joseph Kennedy (65%): If we got this question<br />earlier in the semester, my probablitiy would have<br />been a lot lower, but many things have changed<br />regarding teams in this group. Wales and England<br />have been struggling recently in their final few<br />games before the world cup, where England hasn't<br />won or scored a goal in their last five games.<br />Iran, while looked to be the weaker of the four<br />teams, has been playing well and could shock a few<br />teams does still worry me though. Still, I think<br />with England and wales struggles, we can grab a<br />few points off them and likley finish second in<br />the group.","Meredith Stevens (50%): 1) in order to return<br />16 the US will have to be two very strong teams<br />whales and Iran 2) The US has not reached round 16<br />many times but has reached it in 2010 and 2014.","Patrick Egan (65%): I do not watch or care about<br />soccer, however the US is favored to beat Wales<br />and Iran, and we only need 2nd, so I'm predicting<br />A RESOUNDING UNITED STATES 2ND PLACE JUST BEHIND<br />ENGLAND SO WE QUALIFY! WOOOO USA! USA! USA! USA!","Audrey Vaughan (30%): The U.S is very in<br />the middle compared to the other countries<br />predictions, so the highest prediction is +100000,<br />the lowest is +450, and the US is +8000 so based<br />on that they aren't the best team but they arent<br />horrible. So they might make it but not super<br />likely. The US didnt go to the world cup in 2018,<br />but they did in 2014 and they were ranked 13th.<br />(also I know literally nothing about the world cup<br />so i don't fully understand what the prediction<br />websites are saying)","Nicholas Chao (30%): Over the past couple of world<br />cups, the United states either did not make the<br />round of 16 or got eliminated during the round of<br />16.","Hannah Jones (57%): Honestly I don't know much on<br />this subject but I think the US has a good chance<br />of reaching the round of 16. The men's US soccer<br />is not typically the best in the world but they<br />are a strong team. I think they will beat someone<br />in their group in order to move on.","Noah Herndon (70%): I don't know much about<br />soccer, but I looked up the rankings and saw that<br />America is the 15th ranked team while Wales is the<br />18th and Iran the 21st. All the US needs to do is<br />beat these two teams, and the USA's expectations<br />are to make it to the round of 16. The USMNT<br />also made the round of 16 in 2010 and 2014, not<br />2018 though, but we will ignore 2018. For those<br />reasons, I give the USMNT a 70% chance to make it.","mac kinnebrew (75%): The USMNT has gotten a lot<br />better with many good young players that play for<br />big time clubs. The round of 16 is tough to reach,<br />but not impossible.","Arianna Ycaza (85%): Yes, based on my research<br />the Round of 26 during the World Cup consists of<br />them playing within the individual groups and the<br />winner moves forward. The United States will win<br />their group, as they are much better at soccer<br />then Iran and likely will do better or similar to<br />their other group competitors England and Wales.","Jeremy Lee (30%): - In the previous World Cups,<br />USA has rarely reached the round of 16 and most of<br />the time they didn't advance that far - The teams<br />that USA has to go against for group stage look<br />like good teams","Adam Szczupak (50%): According to popular Vegas<br />sports books (DraftKings and fanduel) the US team<br />is at +100 or an implied probability of 50% to<br />reach the round of 16","David Barrero (70%): USA has been playing at<br />its worse currently especially during these two<br />past friendlies where the attacking presence<br />of the team was no where to be seen. Before<br />these friendlies however the US had been<br />playing decently and their young talent has<br />been flourishing overseas. However in the Group<br />Stage they will be facing competition that will<br />give them problems with teams such as England,<br />Wales, and although underrated an Iranian team<br />that always competes well and is coming off a win<br />against Uruguay in a friendly. With that being<br />said both England and Wales are also struggling<br />and the youth of the US will give them enough to<br />squeeze by in 2nd place of the Group","Charlie Estabrook (67%): The United States is<br />in Group B. It is very doable for the US to<br />make it out of group me as their only difficult<br />competition is England. The US should be able to<br />take car at least two of the other teams in the<br />group and draw another. The United States didn't<br />qualify for the last World Cup and they really let<br />the entire country down. I think the US is very<br />hungry to make a mark in the World Cup and with<br />enough support from us, I think they can make it<br />past the knockout stage and into the round of 16.","Olivia West (50%): The United States soccer<br />team is ranked number 14 in the FIFA Men's World<br />Rankings, making them have a slightly higher<br />chance to reach round 16 of the 2022 World Cup in<br />Qatar. Although the US team is very competitive,<br />other teams competing with them have a higher<br />world ranking, making their chance 50 - 50.","Andrew Decker (70%): I am not the biggest soccer<br />fan. I do know that the US betting odds have the<br />US getting second in the group. They would be<br />behind the UK with superstars like Tottenhams<br />Harry Kane. While Wales and Iran both have decent<br />teams, I think the US can make it out of the the<br />group stage.","Edward Cox (80%): I have no clue how good our team<br />is but I’m pretty sure we are not the absolute<br />worst. All we have to do is beat one team. I think<br />we should be able to do that with our odds.","Joe Ornstein (55%): Outside View: The US has made<br />it to the Round of 16 in 4/7 World Cups since it<br />first qualified in 1990. Inside View: This year,<br />the US is in Group B with England, Wales, and<br />Iran, a group that has been called the \"Group<br />Of Death\" on account of political hostilities<br />between the countries / the high combined FIFA<br />Ranking. England ranks 5th overall, so they are<br />the clear favorite to win the Group. Runner up<br />also qualifies for the Group of 16, and the sports<br />betting odds have the US slightly under even odds<br />of beating Wales and securing the runner-up spot.<br />I'll go a shade

I think that it is not<br />likley that the braves will win back to back<br />world series, as the last time this happened was<br />1999-2000. I think it is very unlickly for the<br />braves to win the world series this year.","Joseph Kennedy (20%): On average sicne 2000,<br />each year there is only 2 categroy 4 hurricanes.<br />To add, category four hurricans occur the most<br />in september. Since 2022 has already brought us<br />two category 4 hurricanes and that it is already<br />October, I do not see us having another categroy 4<br />hurricane.","Joseph Kennedy (15%): The last time kanye got<br />banned was in March of 2022. I do not think<br />instagram will ban him again, just for how big of<br />an account he has on instagram. I think that it<br />is very unlickley he gets banned again before the<br />start of the new year.","Patrick Egan (25%): 25 seems low, but of all the<br />teams in the MLB Postseason, the Braves are the<br />ones I think have the largest chance of winning<br />the World Series. The issue is that there are 12<br />incredibly good teams going for it, which stinks.<br />They should all just give up and let the Braves<br />win.","Patrick Egan (35%): There have been 146 Total<br />Cat4 hurricanes (recorded by humans). Only 52<br />were in the months of October or November (mostly<br />October). With the peak of Hurricane Season being<br />almost over, it's unlikely we'll have another Cat<br />4 by the end of the semester.","Patrick Egan (0%): Oh boy, I'll sure look like a<br />fool if this is wrong! Kanye West was banned in<br />March, and I'm sure he's learned his lesson and<br />is ready to follow Meta's Terms of Service and<br />not violate the rules :) he only has to make it 2<br />months I believe in him","Nicholas Chao (45%): Even though the Braves are a<br />very strong team and were first in their region,<br />I don't see then wining the world series back to<br />back. Very few teams actually make it happen.","Nicholas Chao (100%): Not sure if this questions<br />specifically meant for hitting the US, but<br />Hurricane Julia is currently a category 4 in the<br />Caribbean.","Nicholas Chao (75%): He is currently restricted<br />from Instagram. His reaction was not too good and<br />now switched to Twitter. I think this would only<br />make it worse and after his restriction, he will<br />get banned from his actions.","Noah Herndon (60%): The latest odds have the<br />Braves at +500 to win the World Series, but the<br />Braves have been incredibly hot as of late which<br />is why I think they have a good shot at winning<br />the World Series. The Braves have also been on<br />this stage before; they know how to play in big<br />games and win big games. I gave them a 60% chance<br />of winning because there are still plenty of games<br />left, but I do think they can win it, so I leaned<br />towards a higher than 50% chance of winning the<br />World Series.","Noah Herndon (30%): I think there is a possibility<br />that there is another Category 4 this season,<br />but I think it is more likely that there won't<br />be one. November is usually tame when it comes<br />to hurricanes because most of the cooler weather<br />has moved in. There are still possibilities of<br />hurricanes in October, but I really don't believe<br />that they will reach Category 4 status. My<br />probability on this question is primarily due to<br />gut feeling; I just don't feel like we will see<br />another Category 4.","Noah Herndon (60%): Kanye's Instagram has already<br />been restricted, so I don't think it's too much<br />more to predict that he would be banned from the<br />platform. He was locked out of his Twitter over<br />the weekend for posting anti-semantic tweets,<br />and I only think it's going to get worse. He is<br />clearly fully unhinged and needs help, but I do<br />think there's a decent chance he's banned from<br />Instagram by the end of the semester.","Audrey Vaughan (40%): there have only been 14<br />teams in all of history to win at least 2 world<br />series in a row, so the chances are already very<br />slim. however, the braves are at the top of their<br />bracket and are doing very well this season so<br />far, so there is a possibility that they could<br />pull it off, especially because of the support,<br />money, and publicity that they have from winning<br />last year","Audrey Vaughan (5%): there have only been 143<br />cat 4 hurricanes in the past 170 years near the<br />Atlantic. That being said, we already had a cat 4<br />hurricane this year so its very unlikely for that<br />to occur again. the worst months for hurricanes<br />are June to the end of November, so there's not a<br />lot of time for another bad hurricane to happen.<br />If there was a possible cat 4 hurricane coming<br />within the next 2 months it would probably be<br />known by now.","Audrey Vaughan (70%): Kanye West has been locked<br />out of his twitter and instagram accounts for<br />anti-semitic posts and his accounts have been<br />restricted. Many insta users are requesting a<br />permanent ban because of his posts. Recently a<br />man named Andrew Tate was banned from instagram<br />because of his misogynist posts and sexist<br />content. Instagram will not hesitate to ban Kanye<br />as well for his offensive posts.","Charlie Estabrook (32%): The Braves had the second<br />highest winning percentage in the league over<br />the last half of the season (81 games). They are<br />playing incredibly well and more importantly they<br />are defending champions. They have experience and<br />they are in the same position that they were last<br />year.","Charlie Estabrook (58%): There have been two major<br />hurricanes this year so far. In 4 of the last 5<br />years there have been more than 2 major hurricanes<br />according to the national hurricane center.","Charlie Estabrook (100%): I am writing this on<br />Monday and was banned from Instagram Sunday.","Adam Szczupak (9%): the odds via DraftKings<br />sportsbook gives the braves an implied probability<br />of 8.55 percent, so since they know much more than<br />me, I will use their research, with a little bias.","Adam Szczupak (31%): Hurricane season ends on<br />November 30th. Although this was predicted to be a<br />strong season, the usual \"peak\" of September 10th<br />has came and went with only one major category 4<br />hurricane. This leads me to believe that, unless<br />meteorological conditions change, there will not<br />be another category 4 hurricane over the next<br />month and 20 days. Nevertheless, there is still<br />large chance that things change and due to climate<br />change, hurricanes have become more abundant and<br />powerful.","Adam Szczupak (8%): Although he just got banned<br />from twitter due to his anti-Semitic rant, he has<br />never gotten banned from Instagram. Moreover, he<br />posts his more controversial stuff on twitter,<br />not Instagram. Also, I feel that it is much harder<br />to get banned permanently from Instagram unless<br />you do something EXTREMELY bad, which Kanye would<br />prefer not to do.","David Barrero (35%): As a fan I want to put 100<br />but I cannot there are many teams that have a<br />great chance of winning including the Dodgers,<br />Astros, Yankees and a few dark horses. The Braves<br />have a great chance this year, but it is hard to<br />say yes with so many good teams in the playoffs<br />and the likelihood is low as only 14 MLB teams<br />have ever won back-to-back championships.","David Barrero (1%): There have only been 144<br />hurricanes to have been recorded as a category 4<br />hurricane since 1851 which means there is a little<br />less than one category 4 hurricane per year since<br />then. Having there already been one high category<br />4 hurricane this year the chance drops for there<br />to be another one during this semester.","David Barrero (35%): Kanye West has not been<br />banned completely already and I don't know if he<br />ever will, but he was just temporarily suspended,<br />so it really depends on if he calms down for a bit<br />or continues down this rabbit hole that will lead<br />to him being banned forever.","Meredith Stevens (60%): 1) Braves are current<br />national champions 2) Braves dominate home runs<br />which are very valuable in baseball. Since June<br />1st they have the best record in MLB (78-34)","Meredith Stevens (70%): 1) Hurricane season has<br />only just begun. There are still 2 more months of<br />hurricane season 2) According to colorado. edu it<br />states that there should be at least 6 more named<br />storms and 4 more hurricanes.","Meredith Stevens (30%): 1) he is a public figure<br />and if he would get banned from instagram then he<br />would most likely sue and cause a lot of problems<br />for the instagram company 2) Instagram also is a<br />place of creativity and freedom to where he most<br />definetly uses and to which his fans enjoy.","Olivia West (50%): Considering the Braves have a<br />fairly good win to lose proportion of 101 wins to<br />61 loses this season, they have a decently high<br />chance to win the World Series. Despite this, the<br />Mets also have the same win to lose ratio, making<br />the odds 50-50 for both teams.","Olivia West (40%): Considering that it is rare for<br />a hurricane to reach a category 4, I'd say that<br />there is a lower probability that there will be<br />another detrimental hurricane this season. Despite<br />this, the probability becomes slightly higher due<br />to the fact that the NOAA says that there is a<br />65% chance of an above-normal season of hurricane<br />activity.","Olivia West (60%): Considering that Kanye tends<br />to go on extreme rampages on Instagram, which<br />involves private conversations from his ex wife<br />or friends, I think there is a fairly high chance<br />that he will get banned from Instagram. Also, he<br />tends to write controversial captions under each<br />of his posts, making it an even higher chance that<br />he will get banned.","Andrew Decker (20%): It is very tough to win the<br />World Series. A lot of times only the teams that<br />are hot in the post season win. I think it is<br />possible but tough since they would most likely<br />have to play through tough teams like the Dodgers<br />and Astros.","Andrew Decker (60%): There is usually a Cat 4<br />hurricane twice a year. Cat 5's are more rare.<br />Hurricanes can occur even in November so I would<br />say that the odds are pretty good.","Andrew Decker (25%): As of now he is currently<br />suspended. I doubt he will get permanently<br />banned since celebs generally don't get banned. I<br />wouldn't put it past Kanye though to get banned.","Edward Cox (10%): Fivethirtyeight gives it a 14<br />percent chance. I have no clue.","Edward Cox (10%): It doesn’t look likely because<br />they seem to be very uncommon. According to<br />“Tampabay.com”, there have only been 14 category 4<br />hurricanes to reach land since 1924. Being in late<br />hurricane season, much less hurricanes are likely<br />to occur meaning it is also unlikely that one will<br />for in October or November.","Edward Cox (80%): It looks like it might happen<br />with him making a lot of antisemitic comments<br />he has been making and they shouldn’t have any<br />tolerance for it.","Arianna Ycaza (65%): I actually have no<br />statistical evidence to back myself up on this.<br />I have read numerous of articles saying that the<br />Braves will not serve as World Series champions<br />for the 2022 season. However, I have also read<br />that this year's team is better than the World<br />Series championship team.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): We only have about a month<br />left for the typical hurricane season, and we have<br />only seen one category 4 hurricane (Ian) come and<br />pass so far. Based on hurricane maps, there do not<br />seem to be any coming within the next couple of<br />weeks so I have to predict no.","Arianna Ycaza (90%): On Saturday October 8th,<br />Kanye West made some anti-semetic statements<br />on Twitter, which led to both his Twitter and<br />Instagram accounts getting locked as a result<br />of violating their policies. The accounts are<br />technically not banned, but he is suspended from<br />posting until the unspecified suspension period<br />is over. Typically, when an account gets suspended<br />for violating community guidelines or hate-speech,<br />the next step is a ban. We've seen this happen<br />before in accounts such as Donald Trump's, who is<br />no longer allowed to post on many platforms. Elon<br />Musk, who just resigned and renegotiated his deal<br />to have a share in Twitter, just announced that<br />he would want to have Kanye back on Twitter and<br />I'm not exactly sure if or how this would affect<br />Instagram's actions.","Ian Driggers (13%): Vegas has them at a 13.2%<br />chance of winning the world series","Ian Driggers (20%): Most hurricanes are in the<br />time drake or mid September to mid October. The<br />storms after that are not as intense","Ian Driggers (55%): I think kanye will be banned<br />but just slightly. I wouldn’t be surprised if<br />he realized that he was abt to be banned and his<br />people close to him started limiting his access<br />but I could also see him saying some very harsh<br />things on there and getting banned for good.","Jeremy Lee (20%): - As much as I love the braves,<br />the odds of a team winning the world series<br />2 years in a row is very low - There are very<br />dominant teams in the other divisions right now<br />such as the yankees and dodgers","Jeremy Lee (50%): - Where are still in the middle<br />of hurricane season so it's a possibility that a<br />category 4 hurricane could form - In the history<br />of hurricanes, the category of hurricanes from<br />October to November vary either being really weak<br />(Cat 1) or really strong with Cat 4 or 5","Jeremy Lee (60%): - He's already restricted on<br />Twitter and Instagram - He's been constantly<br />posting and tweeting inappropriate stuff, and it<br />doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon","Hannah Jones (45%): They were not predicted to win<br />last year and they suprised everyone. Judging by<br />that, i would not expect them to win two years in<br />a row. Not only that but the phillies are a very<br />strong team and they may sweep.","Hannah Jones (64%): Apparently there is one<br />forming right now in the caribbean. We have<br />already seen 9 this season. It would be common to<br />see another one.","Hannah Jones (34%): Kanye helps instagrams numbers<br />a lot. Hes the reason a lot of people go on the<br />app everyday; they want to see the crazy stuff he<br />posts. Not only that but he will never get banned<br />from instagram, maybe twitter though.","Joe Ornstein (17%): Moneyline is about +500 right<br />now, which only makes sense to buy if you think<br />the Braves have a 1/6 shot. There are five teams<br />with a serious shot of winning the World Series<br />right now: Dodgers, Astros, Mets, Yankees, and<br />Braves. So 1/6 seems about right (6th outcome<br />being that one of the other long-shots wins).","Joe Ornstein (18%): Major Cat IV or V hurricanes<br />generally do not form as late as October or<br />November, as the North Atlantic Ocean begins to<br />cool. That said, 25% of the past 20 years have<br />seen a storm that large form sometime after<br />October 11. (See wikipedia timelines) At the<br />moment, the National Hurricane Center is not<br />tracking *any* tropical cyclones or disturbances,<br />except for the Category 1 Julia which just<br />made landfall in Nicaragua. That brings down my<br />estimate to 18%.","Joe Ornstein (30%): My read is that permanent<br />bans on Instagram are reserved for pornography<br />(i.e., things that could get Instagram in trouble<br />with regulators) and that hate speech tends to<br />result in more temporary suspensions (like West's<br />suspension back in March for similar conduct).<br />My guess is that he's temporarily suspended,<br />heads cool, and he's back posting by the end of<br />the semester. That said, it's certainly possible<br />that Zuckerberg and friends decide that multiple<br />violations of their Terms of Service is grounds<br />for a permanent ban."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.29999999999999999,0.45000000000000001,0,1,0.19,1,0.10000000000000001,0.94999999999999996,0.90000000000000002,0.80000000000000004,0.90000000000000002,0.84999999999999998,0.93000000000000005,0.96999999999999997,0.10000000000000001,0.65000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.90000000000000002,0.69999999999999996,0.5,0.050000000000000003,0.69999999999999996,0.01,0.69999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.94999999999999996,0.01,0.69999999999999996,0.01,0.75,0.75,0.93999999999999995,0.10000000000000001,0.94999999999999996],"y":[3.9570976221701128,2.0414496611803772,4.0422693937318401,2.0339300661114974,3.9551408278057352,1.9756779019488022,3.9975193335441874,2.002599750342779,4.0200333604123442,1.9716286698356271,4.0120722165796909,2.0358123016310854,4.0004761042539032,2.0164137471700085,4.0294814890716228,2.0259895588504149,4.0252154388232153,1.9747095005353912,3.9623938080854715,2.0189532215939834,4.0176824046531694,2.0462100317003205,3.985607087239623,2.0038819855079053,4.029434148222208,2.0106114768888803,3.9941314332187177,2.0302293178392574,4.0461312837200243,1.9868228463921696,4.0230346584226933,2.0004332564305516,3.9889770820271222,2.0474120308877901],"text":["Joseph Kennedy (30%): The daily population grows<br />about 200,000 people per day, and there is only<br />56 more days until November 30th.

I've received MULTIPLE answers<br />giving Midnights a 99-100% chance of outselling<br />Evermore. A few of the top reasons I've received<br />on this were: With all the different versions and<br />people buying a clock worth of vinyl and a clock<br />of cds. It has to be more considering Evermore<br />was a surprise and the preorders of Midnights<br />seem to be going well. They've really created<br />a fomo atmosphere for Midnights and then they<br />release another copy you also must have. Evermore<br />was released in the middle of the Christmas dead<br />season with a few hours of digital pre-orders<br />and no physicals available. Midnights is getting<br />released during peak \"buy music for holiday<br />presents!\" with a couple months of preorders and<br />physicals immediately available. It's going to<br />outsell it massively. Thanks, Swifties!","Nicholas Chao (19%): The world clock estimates<br />that there is a net gain of 1 person every 25<br />seconds and counting the amount of seconds until<br />11/30 divided by 25 will not reach 8 billion.","Nicholas Chao (100%): There is a hard general<br />consensus that Midnights will surpass Evermore in<br />sellings. Even the most diehard Taylor Swift fans<br />thing it will be a blowout.","Noah Herndon (10%): I think there's a decent<br />chance that the world population reaches 8 billion<br />by the end of the year, but I highly doubt it<br />will reach 8 billion by the end of the semester.<br />I think the world population growing by 20 million<br />in less than two months is unreasonable. Also,<br />the United Nations expects us to hit 8 billion in<br />2023, and I really don't feel like betting against<br />the United Nations, so I'm going to lean on the<br />safe side and give it only a 10% probability.","Noah Herndon (95%): Evermore was a surprise drop<br />so it missed out on preorders and such while<br />Midnights has been able to take full advantage<br />of pre-sales. Also, Midnights is dropping right<br />before the holiday season which allow it to take<br />advantage of being bought as a gift. Meanwhile,<br />Evermore was dropped in the middle of the holiday<br />season so it was overlooked and ignored by the<br />Christmas season. For all these reasons, I give<br />Midnights a 95% chance of selling more than<br />Evermore.","Audrey Vaughan (90%): the united nations predicts<br />the world population to hit 8 billion on november<br />15 Even if it only gets close to 8 illion by nov.<br />15, by the end of the semester it will most likely<br />hit it.","Audrey Vaughan (80%): evermore became the<br />best-selling album of the year in July, with<br />374,000 copies sold in 2021. Evermore was the<br />seventh most consumed album, and earned 818,000<br />total units. It surpassed 462,000 sales by<br />November 2021, howeverrrrrr midnights has been<br />promoted for several months and it has already<br />gotten so much publicly and pre-sales. Midnight is<br />predicted to sell better than her album \"Red\" and<br />she has really popular artists featured which will<br />also help with the sales.","Charlie Estabrook (90%): The United Nations put<br />out that they think the world will reach 8 billion<br />people in population by November 15th, 2022. If<br />the United Nations thinks that, and a I trust that<br />they know much more than I do, then I believe it.<br />There is a chance that there is a world crisis<br />such as a nuclear war, so I am not 100 percent<br />certain.","Charlie Estabrook (85%): Evermore was released on<br />very short notice. Midnights has been announced<br />in advance, is highly anticipated, and has done<br />good in pre-order sales (which count towards first<br />week sales). I also think Midnights being released<br />on October 21st is a better release date than<br />Evermore's December 11th release date. December is<br />Christmas season and I think people are thinking<br />more about Christmas than an album.","Adam Szczupak (93%): The UN, which is a rather<br />reliable source for information, stated in a<br />recent article that the world population will<br />reach 8 billion on November 15th 2022. This is<br />a very specific date which gives it claim some<br />validity. Moreover, there is about a month and a<br />half cushion if this estimate is off.","Adam Szczupak (97%): Taylor did not market<br />Evermore much, while she has marketed this new<br />album extensively. Moreover, Evermore was released<br />with a mere few hours of digital pre-orders and<br />no physicals available, whereas Midnights has a<br />couple months of hype with preorders and physicals<br />immediately available.","David Barrero (10%): The population grew in the<br />past year by about 60 million people and it is<br />not likely that the 20 million growth will happen<br />in one month. The busiest months for child birth<br />have also passed which means the growth rate will<br />diminish.","David Barrero (65%): This the first Original album<br />of Taylor Swift since 2020 and there is a lot of<br />hype around it because of the fact and not only<br />that but her pre-order sales have been high. I<br />also asked a swift fan about what they thought and<br />they predicted that Midnight will have more sales<br />first week.","Meredith Stevens (90%): 1) Yes it should because<br />it is very close currently being at 7.98 billion<br />2) Every day the amount of births is around<br />385,000. So by November 30rd it should well exceed<br />8 billion.","Meredith Stevens (90%): 1) Midnight is getting<br />released during peak holiday / gift giving season.<br />While evermore was released during the middle<br />of christmas dead season. 2) Evermore was a<br />suprise wbile Midnignt has been announced and the<br />preorders have been doing very well.","Olivia West (70%): Considering that there is an<br />average population growth of 150,000 people a<br />day and there is currently 7.9 billion people in<br />the world, there is a fairly high chance that the<br />world population will reach 8 billion by the end<br />of the semester. The probability becomes slightly<br />lower because 50 days left x 150,000 people per<br />day rounds to 7.4 million people, and the world<br />population needs 10 million to reach 8 billion.","Olivia West (50%): Considering that Taylor's album<br />\"Evermore\" was very popular and sold over 500,000<br />copies its first week after it was released,<br />the probability that her new album will sell<br />more 50-50. Even though her new album is very<br />anticipated, selling more than 500,000 copies in<br />the first week will be difficult to beat.","Andrew Decker (5%): I did some calculations. First<br />I found out the average life growth per day this<br />year. Then I multiplied it by the number of days<br />until Nov 30. Then I added that number to the<br />total number of people right now. According to my<br />calculations, in November, the population should<br />be around 7.92 billion, not 8 billion.","Andrew Decker (70%): Her last album was announced<br />only a few days before release. This album has<br />been more publicized and has been announced for<br />longer. Therefore I think there will be more<br />copies sold week one.","Edward Cox (1%): Based off of the population<br />growth today, it should grow to around 10 million<br />by the end of the semester. Unless somehow, there<br />was some sort of baby boom, it is most likely not<br />reach 8 billion.","Edward Cox (70%): I have no idea but im choosing<br />a side. I think it probably has a chance to sell<br />over a million in over a week because it is Taylor<br />swift.","Arianna Ycaza (95%): Yes, within the past week we<br />have increased by population by over 20,000,000<br />people which puts us on track to reach 8 billion<br />within the upcoming weeks.","Arianna Ycaza (95%): \"Evermore\", released in<br />December 2020 with only a day's notice, made over<br />1 million copies of the album globally within<br />the first week. This album sold this many copies<br />in the first week with one version of the album<br />and no opportunity to preorder. As of 10 days<br />before the album release, Taylor Swift's official<br />website has 4 vinyl versions and 4 CD versions<br />available to buy, so it is safe to assume that a<br />considerable amount of copies have already sold.<br />It is also important to note that \"Evermore\" was<br />not available to buy in stores until December<br />18th, exactly one week after the album's surprise<br />release. Another statistic that sways me to<br />believe that \"Midnights\" will sell more or at<br />the very least the same amount of copies globally<br />within the first week than \"Evermore\" did is that<br />every Taylor Swift album besides her debut album,<br />\"Taylor Swift\" sold 1 million copies globally<br />during their first week.","Ian Driggers (1%): It is predicted that it will<br />reach 8 billion by end of 2022 or beginning of<br />2023","Ian Driggers (70%): I think that people will<br />really rally behind Taylor switft for her album.","Jeremy Lee (1%): - Based on the average growth<br />rate of around 14,000 people per day, I don't<br />think it will be able to reach 8 billion by the<br />end of the semester - The population would need to<br />grow at least 20 million within the next month and<br />a half","Jeremy Lee (75%): - Evermore seems to be her<br />least popular album out of all the albums she has<br />put out since the start of her career - She has<br />a really big fan base now and I believe a lot of<br />people would support her by purchasing a lot of<br />albums","Hannah Jones (75%): It is currently projected to<br />reach 8 billion. 70 years from now it is supposed<br />to increased by 2.5 billion. I would trust these<br />predictions because they are from experts.","Hannah Jones (94%): This album has a lot more hype<br />than evermore did. She also came out with \"taylors<br />version\" prior to this album so her relevance has<br />increased. I also think since blake lively has a<br />lot to do with the production of the music videos<br />it will get a lot of attention.","Joe Ornstein (10%): This is a weird one, because<br />we're making a prediction about a prediction. We<br />can't literally go out and count every person in<br />the world, so things like the world population<br />clock are necessarily estimates based on past<br />projections from agencies like the UN or US Census<br />Bureau. The Worldometer is basing its projections<br />on the 2019 UN World Population Prospects report<br />and US Census, which didn't project 8 billion<br />people until 2023 and 2026 repspectively. But<br />the latest update (WPP 2022) projects 8 billion<br />people by November 15. So...the way the question<br />is phrased, it comes down to whether or not the<br />people behind Worldometer Population Clock will<br />update their methodology to solely consider WPP<br />2022 before the end of the semester. This is a<br />substantially more boring question.","Joe Ornstein (95%): Evermore actually had<br />unusually low first-week numbers for a Taylor<br />Swift album (~329k, for an artist who is<br />regularly selling >1million in the first week),<br />probably because it dropped just a few months<br />after Folklore (~846k first week). Since this is<br />Taylor's first studio album in 2 years, I would<br />be very surprised if its first week sales were<br />as low as Evermore. Purportedly, there were 100k<br />pre-orders within one day of announcing (and<br />preorders get included in the Week 1 total for<br />Billboard 200)."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.48999999999999999,0.33000000000000002,0.38],"y":[1.0451327432179824,3.0027794426772743,5.0364814605796706],"text":["Class

She<br />said it was likely to be above 8500, so I gave it<br />80% for her.","Patrick Egan (1%): I went through Athens Georgia<br />weather history for every November since I was<br />born. It did not snow ONCE. it is not snowing. i<br />hope. I put 1% because I want snow and that makes<br />me give it a chance.","Patrick Egan (85%): TBD","Hannah Jones (0%): They are projected to admit<br />5,000-6,000 student in early action. They also<br />have never admitted that many students to uga<br />ever. I see no chance in them allowed this many<br />student in regular decision.","Hannah Jones (0%): Athens has had a warm fall so<br />far which means that the chances that it snows<br />between now and november 30th are low. Also the<br />snowy period for athens and most of georgia is<br />january to february, not november.","Hannah Jones (85%): This is one of those things<br />where you have to go though with the joke. It<br />would be more funny if the lettuce outlived her<br />for sure.","Nicholas Chao (0%): For 2021, they only admitted<br />8066 students and I do not see going over 400+<br />more students than last year.","Nicholas Chao (0%): Snow is already really rare<br />in Georgia and is only a few days out of the whole<br />year. Those days are usually only in January or<br />February and I do not see it coming before Nov<br />30th.","Nicholas Chao (60%): Even though she is under<br />a lot of fire, and odds are that she is leaning<br />towards stepping down, I think that she would last<br />another 6 days compared to the lettuce's shelf<br />life.","Noah Herndon (80%): I feel like the class of 2026<br />sets the standards for future classes; UGA isn't<br />going to admit nearly 9,000 students last year<br />and then admit less than 8,500 students this year.<br />For 2020, they admitted approximately 7,000, 8,000<br />for 2021, and 9,000 for 2022. UGA is trending<br />higher and higher in student counts, so I don't<br />think they would all of sudden cut out a lot of<br />Early Admissions. Lastly, we just won the National<br />Championship, a lot of people want to come here.<br />I think there's a really good chance we admit more<br />than 8,500 students.","Noah Herndon (0%): As someone who has lived in<br />Georgia all my life, it has never snowed before<br />December or even got remotely close to snowing<br />before. It has maybe snowed once or twice in<br />December in Georgia my entire life, but never<br />before. I think it is impossible; there is<br />absolutely no way it snows before December, and I<br />am willing to die on this hill.","Noah Herndon (80%): I think a couple of days<br />is too short of time for a prime minister to<br />drastically step down. Politicians are also<br />usually narcissists, so I would be surprised<br />if she stepped down. She only just became Prime<br />Minister in September, so I highly doubt she will<br />no longer be the prime minister before November.","Olivia West (90%): Considering that UGA offered<br />8,917 Early Action applicants a spot at this<br />school for class of 2022, I think there is a<br />very high chance that UGA will admit over 8,500<br />students early action this year. Also, since there<br />are usually about 20,000 students who apply each<br />year and UGA's acceptance rate is 50%, there is<br />a very high chance that UGA will admit over 8,500<br />students early action this year.","Olivia West (20%): Considering that temperatures<br />still have a very high average during the month of<br />November in Athens, I'd say that there is a very<br />low chance that it will snow before November 30th.<br />Also, Athens generally only receives about 12 mm<br />of snow per year, making the chance even lower<br />that it will snow before November 30th.","Olivia West (40%): There is a fairly minimal<br />likelihood that Truss will outlive the lettuce<br />given that she has only been in the position for<br />38 days and that period she and Kwarteng have been<br />accused of doing enormous damage to the British<br />economy. Also, considering that she is very<br />disliked by the public, it makes it an even less<br />chance that she will outlast the lettuce.","Andrew Decker (30%): I doubt it. Last year 8917<br />were accepted EA. While the school obviously wants<br />more and more people, I think UGA is probably<br />going to limit admissions this year as the campus<br />is too full. Although they might admit more than<br />8500 because of the new space in the BDM hall.","Andrew Decker (5%): Athens usually has no snowfall<br />in November. I give it 5 percent because of any<br />odd chance but I highly doubt it will snow.","Andrew Decker (75%): I think she will outlast<br />the lettuce. As of monday, the lettuce only has<br />5 days left. There was also an article that came<br />out today stating the Truss does not plan on<br />resigning. I'd give it pretty good odds she can<br />last 5 days more.","Arianna Ycaza (95%): Last year, UGA released<br />that their target freshman class size was around<br />6,000 students. We have to expect that this year<br />the target class size has to be similar or at<br />most only slightly larger, considering that the<br />class of 2026 is the largest class UGA has ever<br />welcomed. Application rates are looking to go up<br />after UGA secured the national championship, UGA<br />is a popular school that the high school class of<br />2023 is applying to. For the class of 2026, UGA<br />admitted 8,900 students Early Action. This year, I<br />predict that there is a very high chance that UGA<br />will again admit 8,900 students or even higher in<br />order to gain their target freshman class again<br />next year, while also keeping up with the number<br />of applications increasing.","Arianna Ycaza (5%): This will not happen because<br />like most of North Georgia, Athens will only<br />experience 1 or 2 days of snow per year and most<br />of the time it occurs during January or February.<br />November in Athens GA has an average yearly<br />snowfall of 0\".","Arianna Ycaza (95%): It is clear that officials,<br />the public, and the press all want Liz Truss to<br />be removed from power as Prime Minister. However,<br />according to Channel 4 News UK: The Conservative<br />Party Rulebook outlines that Prime Ministers<br />cannot be removed for one year. Members of<br />Parliament are sending letters of no confidence to<br />the chairman of the 1922 committee, Graham Brady<br />who represents the conservative party members in<br />the House of Commons. These letters cannot trigger<br />a vote to remove Truss but parliament members are<br />hoping that the letters can influence the 1922<br />committee to change the rules so that Truss can<br />be removed only after a month as PM or for the<br />Sir Graham Brady to advise Truss that it is of her<br />best interest to leave, similar to what happened<br />with Teresa May and Boris Johnson. The shelf<br />live of the lettuce used in the Daily Star's live<br />stream is 10 days and some have already passed<br />at this point. Based on everything said, I think<br />there is little chance of Truss being removed<br />from office through a rules change or a standard<br />parliamentary vote in the next couple of days.","Audrey Vaughan (95%): In 2022, 8,917 students were<br />admitted early action. in 2021 8,086 students,<br />in 2020 7025 students. Every year it seems to<br />increase how many students are admitted early.<br />There have been lots of complaints that UGA<br />accepted too many students in 2022, however, the<br />building of the new dorm allows for several more<br />students to attend UGA first year, so I believe<br />the number will be at least 8,500.","Audrey Vaughan (5%): It never snows in Georgia<br />before December or January last year in Athens,<br />the temperature on November 30, was a high of 66,<br />and a low of 30.9. This being said, its nowhere<br />near snowing in November.","Audrey Vaughan (85%): depending on the definition<br />of the lettuces lifespan... If its the edible<br />lifespan it could live around 1-3 weeks, but if<br />its just how long it can last sitting there, it<br />could be several months. Many are saying she only<br />has 7 days in control before becoming hostage to<br />market forces though. she's only been in the job<br />for a little over 40 days and is already doing so<br />bad, she will definitely be leaving soon.","David Barrero (85%): Last Year there were over<br />8500 students accepted early and it does not seem<br />that the number will drop because the amount of<br />applicants applying early keeps increasing. It<br />is very likely that because more students apply<br />if UGA keeps about the same acceptance rate then<br />there will be over 8500 students accepted.","David Barrero (10%): The temperatures every year<br />have been and the days when it snows has been<br />decreasing. Before this Athens rarely gets any<br />snow anyways and for it to snow before what seem<br />to be the \"winter months' it is highly unlikely.","David Barrero (55%): I do not know how the<br />tensions are in the UK but from what I have seen<br />it seems as if her time is finished. The one thing<br />that makes this troubling is if Parliament can<br />agree on a successor for her before the Lettuce<br />dies, and we do not know what it means to outlast<br />the lettuce it is unclear by how it will be<br />decided that the lettuce is done or not.","Meredith Stevens (95%): 1) According to<br />admissions.uga.edu it states that they’re going<br />to admit 8,900+ 2) Even if they don’t admit 8,900+<br />their is still a strong possibility of more than<br />8,500 students.","Meredith Stevens (30%): 1) Most likely know<br />because the average temperature in Athens ranges<br />from 43°F-59°F 2) It is rarely below 30° F this<br />is all from weather spark. com","Meredith Stevens (10%): 1) Most likely yes I don’t<br />think it will be in the livestream for that long<br />2) She just started as prime minister and has a<br />long time to go. The commitment must be serious to<br />keep the lettuce for that long.","Charlie Estabrook (68%): 8,917 were at admitted<br />EA last year and I don't see why we couldn't see<br />similar numbers next year. The only thing that<br />could make that number go down significantly<br />is if the rumors about Creswell hall getting<br />demolished next year are true and there would be<br />significantly less housing space for students.","Charlie Estabrook (16%): The average low for<br />Athens in November is 42 degrees which is a long<br />step away from 32, where even it if temperatures<br />do reach freezing, the average number of days with<br />rain is 6.","Charlie Estabrook (34%): It has been said that<br />the only thing keeping her in office right now<br />is the process of finding a new successor. Today<br />is day five for the lettuce and I think finding a<br />successor and getting them into office is going to<br />take a little long then 5 five more days.","Mac Kinnebrew (70%): Every year they admit more<br />and more early admission students. I also think<br />many more will apply with Georgia winning the<br />national championship.","Mac Kinnebrew (75%): Although I don’t think it<br />will snow hard, I think it will snow a little. It<br />is already beginning to get cooler out and I think<br />it will snow at least one day.","Mac Kinnebrew (50%): I am very on the fence about<br />this one. I think they lettuce may die but Liz<br />truss also may be near here end.","Adam Szczupak (98%): UGA demonstrated that they<br />have the infrastructure to admit 8900 last year<br />early action, so I see no reason for that to<br />change. Especially with covid numbers going down","Adam Szczupak (3%): It hasn’t snowed in athens on<br />November since 1976. Also, that is only two weeks<br />away","Adam Szczupak (34%): There is a UK betting site<br />that has the implied probability of her remaining<br />in office at 31%. I think it is a tad higher.","Edward Cox (85%): Uga says that they base their<br />numbers off of the previous years and there were<br />8,900 early admitted students last year. This is<br />primarily from people who love football or know<br />that this is where they want to go and for the<br />time being uga is still number one on college<br />rankings. I think it will depend if the football<br />honestly.","Edward Cox (1%): It looks like it never snows in<br />November but snows frequently in December.","Edward Cox (75%): I have no clue. I don’t think<br />she will be out in the next ten days but I think<br />she is screwed to hold the position for much<br />longer.","Joe Ornstein (90%): More and more students<br />have been applying to EA at UGA, from 10k EA<br />applications a decade ago to ~20k last year. On<br />Twitter Monday, the UGA Admissions office reported<br />there were *26k* EA applications this year, up<br />21%. If we admitted fewer than 8,500, that would<br />be a historically low EA admissions rate.","Joe Ornstein (2%): I may be reading the NOAA<br />data wrong (so I'll give it more than 0%),<br />but there has not been a single November day<br />over the past seven years when a Clarke County<br />weather station has recorded snowfall. Heck,<br />there's barely been a weather station in *all<br />of Georgia* that's recorded more than trace<br />amounts of snow during that time period.<br />https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/daily-snow/GA/snowfall/20211116","Joe Ornstein (54%): Bookies in the UK (where<br />wagers on politics are inexplicably legal) will<br />pay out 15 pounds for a 10 pound wager that Lizz<br />Truss is replaced in 2022. So that's about 66%<br />chance she's replaced by the end of the year. But<br />the Daily Star says their lettuce will decay in 35<br />days (by November 25). If the odds of her lasting<br />until the end of the year are 33%, then a constant<br />hazard rate suggests her chance of lasting five<br />weeks is .33^(5/9), or roughly 54%. For context,<br />after a disastrous few weeks as Prime Minister (a<br />failed tax reform plan followed by a market crash<br />in the value of the pound), only 7% of UK voters<br />approve of Liz Truss' government (compare that to<br />42ish percent Biden approval). In parliamentary<br />systems, it is much more normalized that party<br />leaders resign in the face of poor popularity<br />(as Boris Johnson did after it was revealed that<br />he and his staff had a bunch of COVID parties).<br />Prime ministers are expected to maintain the<br />party's image, and failing that, the Tories<br />can and (likely will) force her out.

I think that<br />this sequal of the game will also get a 10 on IGN<br />due to the overall hype and also since it looks<br />like a good game.","Jeremy Lee (50%): - Although he's showing some<br />interest in buying Twitter, he did drop the deal<br />out nowhere that one time which shows that he<br />has hesitations about buying the company - to be<br />honest, I have no idea whether he's going to buy<br />Twitter or not","Jeremy Lee (80%): - The latest God of War on<br />the Playstation 4 was given a review score of<br />10 which came out 3 years ago, and all the other<br />God of Wars were given above 9.0 ratings with<br />older Playstation models - With the Playstation<br />4 version of the game receiving such a high<br />evaluation, I believe the new God of War Ragnarok<br />will receive the same ratings especially with the<br />better graphics","Patrick Egan (1%): Buying a business takes a long<br />time, and with Elon and Twitter still bickering<br />over tons of minor details about the deal, it's<br />unlikely this deal will be completely until<br />probably 2025 imo.","Patrick Egan (4%): Only 19 games have ever gotten<br />a perfect score on IGN. I expect God of War to<br />pass a 9, but it's just far too unlikely it'll get<br />a 10, it's just another God of War game.","Hannah Jones (72%): Musk would have complete<br />control over twitter. He also revived his $44<br />billion twitter bid. I think he will end up buying<br />twitter because he wants it to be a more freely<br />spoken place.","Hannah Jones (48%): I don't know much about this<br />but no matter what it is pretty hard to earn a 10<br />on a rating. Also, this is possibly the last game<br />of the series so depending on how it ends it could<br />leave people upset and lower their ratings.","Nicholas Chao (70%): All articles point to<br />that Elon is on the verge of buying Twitter and<br />that there is a deal in place but not yet been<br />fulfilled. I believe by the end of the semester it<br />will happen.","Nicholas Chao (50%): Even though the last game<br />got a 10 and the prequels received mid to high 9<br />ratings, I don't see this one getting a perfect<br />10. Achieving this is really hard and critics are<br />getting stricter is more and more games come out.","Noah Herndon (20%): Elon Musk vocalized his desire<br />to buy Twitter spring of this year. Since then<br />he has flip flopped on his decision, so he may<br />not even still want to buy it and the end of the<br />semester. And even if Elon Musk commits to buying<br />Twitter, there is so much court and law stuff it<br />will have to go through before it is actually set<br />in stone because Twitter is such a big platform.","Noah Herndon (70%): This is the most anticipated<br />release of the year and will most likely be a<br />contender for game of the year. The original<br />scored a 10/10 according to IGN, and this one is<br />supposed to bigger and better than the previous<br />which I think gives it a good chance to repeat.<br />Also, another highly praised Playstation series,<br />The Last of Us, had the original and sequel score<br />a 10/10. As God of War Ragnarok is a sequel and<br />a playstation game, I think it has a good shot at<br />getting a 10/10.","Olivia West (70%): Since Elon Musk is<br />reconsidering the $40 billion offer on Twitter<br />and basically already owns most of Twitter through<br />shares, there is a fairly high chance that he will<br />but Twitter. Musk also suggested that a plan to<br />buy Twitter be finalized, reversing a months-long<br />push to get the arrangement terminated, making the<br />chance even higher that he will purchase it.","Olivia West (50%): Considering that God of War:<br />Ragnarok is one of 2022's most anticipated games,<br />I'd say there's a fairly high chance that it will<br />receive a score of 10 in IGN's review. Also, God<br />of War in 2018 received a score of 10, so it makes<br />the chances even higher that God of War: Ragnarok<br />will also receive a score of 10 in IGN's review.","Andrew Decker (50%): Musk has gone back and forth<br />over the acquisition of Twitter. At one time he<br />seemed to back out of it, but now the gov has<br />seemingly forced him into buying it. Although he<br />has recently asked for the buy out to be delayed<br />because of debt finaciation. Overall I have no<br />idea if it will be done before Dec.","Andrew Decker (30%): The first game got a 10.<br />Its tough to follow up 10s in a row but it is<br />certainly possible as the game has a lot of hype.","Arianna Ycaza (95%): With a 9.2% stake in Twitter,<br />Elon Musk became the biggest shareholder of<br />the social media company over the summer. This<br />percentage proved to be a worthwhile investment as<br />the company grew by 27% after his buy-in. A deal<br />arranged for him to buy the company was put on<br />hold in April, however lawyers and officials have<br />been given a deadline of October 28 to close the<br />deal with Musk, who is offering to buy the company<br />for a value of $44 billion. Musk seems serious<br />about going through with this deal in order to<br />protect free speech on the platform and reduce<br />bots.","Arianna Ycaza (90%): God of War (2018) received a<br />score of 10 in IGN's review. Based on this alone,<br />we can project that the second game will receive a<br />decently high score. Furthermore, IGN sequel video<br />game reviews seem to be relatively consistent<br />with the review score given to the original game.<br />Additionally, through a brief look-through of the<br />most recent list of games that have received a 10<br />review score by IGN, majority seem to be directly<br />categorized as action-adventure games, similar to<br />God of War: Ragnarok.","Audrey Vaughan (15%): Elon musk is the largest<br />outside shareholder of twitter, owning 73.5<br />million shares. However he only has a 9.2% stake<br />as of right now. Elon made a proposal to buy<br />twitter in mid april, and he still does not own<br />it. Buying twitter is a really big deal, and<br />its something that would take a lot of time for<br />everything to follow through, assuming that the<br />owner of twitter even sells it to him. That being<br />said, it will probably be several months before<br />anything is even finalized.","Audrey Vaughan (60%): (I really don't understand<br />how to read these video game ratings but im doing<br />my best.... this may be completely wrong) most the<br />god of war games received a 9-10 rating, however<br />only the most recent received a 10, so i believe<br />its pretty hard to get a 10 rating. Apparently<br />this is the most anticipated game of 2022, but<br />when I asked several guys they said that its<br />supposed to be really good and get around a 10<br />rating.","David Barrero (65%): Elon Musk seems certain on<br />buying Twitter with an incredibly large bid. Many<br />people are starting to predict how Twitter will<br />change once Elon Musk is in full control. He has<br />also said that when he does he will unban Donald<br />Trump from twitter which shows how he thinks he<br />will indeed buy it.","David Barrero (75%): Looking back at all the games<br />that IGN have given a 10 it seems as it isn't that<br />rare for them to give a 10. One of the games that<br />IGN has given a 10 in the past years is God of<br />War which precedes this game. It is very likely<br />that once again the new god of war will get the 10<br />because it has been highly anticipated and hyped.","Meredith Stevens (75%): 1) He has offered to<br />buy twitter already and according to sky news by<br />October 28th will either close his deal or go to<br />trial 2) He is already the biggest share holder of<br />the company.","Meredith Stevens (50%): 1) The 2018 God of War<br />received a 10 rating by critics. 2) The odds<br />of getting a 10 IGN review on both films is not<br />common.","Charlie Estabrook (47%): It is unclear where Elon<br />is heading with purchasing twitter. He has talked<br />about building the \"X' app and I could see him<br />scratching the twitter deal and building it from<br />the ground up. There is also push back from the<br />public that could make it more difficult for him<br />to get the deal done. I think Elon could see this<br />entire thing as a waste of time.","Charlie Estabrook (84%): I don't know much about<br />God of War, but I can say that I have seen it<br />everywhere on social media recently and it has<br />a lot of hype. Ragnarok's game length is rumored<br />to be twice as long as its prequel which fans are<br />very excited about and even IGN themselves. IGN<br />gave God of War a 10 and if Ragnarok lives up to<br />the hype, I think it certainly gets a 10.","Mac Kinnebrew (30%): Elon has run into many<br />problems recently when trying to acquire twitter<br />and I think he will give up. I do not think he<br />wants to take the financial risk and I think he<br />did it for publicity.","Mac Kinnebrew (40%): It is somewhat hard to get a<br />10 rating and this game seems very violent. I do<br />not think it will get a 10 because of how violent<br />it is, but it also is a very anticipated game.","Adam Szczupak (60%): Bloomberg.com quantified that<br />the market priced in on October 10th an about 60<br />percent chance of the deal going through, so I’m<br />utilizing that metric.","Adam Szczupak (99%): I read a Reddit page and they<br />all were very confident.","Edward Cox (75%): Being that he is reviving the<br />plan of buying twitter is very promising and for<br />the fact that he is offering the original amount<br />asked makes it likely that he will buy twitter<br />over the next few weeks.","Edward Cox (85%): I’m not sure but based on the<br />games which have a 10/10 rating, i think that<br />Santa Monica Studio will be able to pull it off.<br />The God of War 2018 was seen as one of the best<br />games and they both took abt the same amount of<br />time to develop. The same fan base is going to be<br />diving back into the same world they love.","Joe Ornstein (81.2%): As of the close on Tuesday,<br />Twitter's stock price is $51.79, which is about<br />81% between where markets thought Twitter was<br />valued without Musk buying it (~$41) and what it<br />would be valued at Musk's $44 billion acquisition<br />($54.20). He has sold about $7 billion in Tesla<br />stock to prepare for the purchase, so the only<br />ways this doesn't resolve to 'yes' is (1) he<br />changes his mind again, (2) external funders<br />don't come through, or (3) the sale doesn't get<br />finalized before the end of the semester. All<br />pretty unlikely.","Joe Ornstein (35%): This franchise has received<br />critical acclaim for every game in the series,<br />and the previous game (God of War - 2018)<br />received the coveted 10/10 from IGN. Ragnarok<br />is the sequel to the 2018 game, with the same<br />creative team, which suggests that their chances<br />are good. But it's worth noting how high a bar<br />this is. A full 10/10 is something that IGN only<br />awards to games it considers a \"masterpiece\"<br />(https://corp.ign.com/review-practices).<br />Only 29 games, about 2 per year, have<br />received a 10/10 since 2008, and the list<br />(https://www.ign.com/articles/how-and-where-to-play-every-modern-ign-1010-game)<br />is a veritable who's-who of genre-defining games.<br />So many brilliant games have come out over the<br />past 14 years that got, say, a 9.8/10 (including<br />all the other games in the God of War franchise).<br />Given that bar, I expect that the most likely<br />result is some regression to the mean: a great<br />score for Ragnarok, but not a *perfect* score."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.62,0.67000000000000004,0.11],"y":[4.0246067946078252,5.0255664556520063,3.0220473078079522],"text":["Class

Adesanya has fought almost 350% more<br />times than his opponent perarra, which makes me<br />think that his expereince can carry him a long way<br />in winning this fight.","Joseph Kennedy (30%): Although North Korea has<br />launch tested the most missiles in a year ever, I<br />think it is unlickley that they launch another one<br />over Japan or SK airspace in the next 20 days. I<br />think the window is too small for more missiles to<br />launch in a specific area. The one caviot to this<br />however is that this country is North Korea, so a<br />launching more missiles wouldn't suprise me.","Joseph Kennedy (45%): According to multiple<br />sources, Bolsonaro is trailing another condidate<br />by about 4 percent, and with the election<br />nearing its end, I think it is unlickley he gets<br />re-elected.","Adam Szczupak (65%): The betting odds across all<br />sports books comes to about -170. The implied<br />probability of this bet then hitting is ~63%. I<br />think, given Israel's track history of being the<br />unanimous best fighter of his weight class for<br />some time now earns an extra 2 percent spread as<br />a responsible risk allocation for this forecasting<br />challenge.","Adam Szczupak (13%): Before the October launch,<br />there had been no launches from North Korea since<br />2017. The sporadic, expensive nature of these<br />nuclear tests suggests that it is unlikely that<br />they will launch another one in the near future.<br />However, they have been more prone to aggressive<br />action during Biden's term than during Trump's.","Adam Szczupak (30.77%): According to the UK<br />betting site \"William Hill\", there is an implied<br />probability of 30.77% for him to win the election.<br />The polls during the general election were<br />extremely wrong, so I disregarded them as a data<br />point, instead opting for a non-biased, third<br />party source from outside Brazil.","Audrey Vaughan (60%): Pereira, his competitor,<br />has defeated Adesanya on two occasions already,<br />but that serves as more motivation for Adesanya<br />and Pereira's guard is lower. adesanya has a<br />23-1 record as of now, but based on their body<br />measurements they are pretty equal. Adesanya is<br />defending his tittle so he has more on the line<br />for this too.","Audrey Vaughan (70%): South Korea claims that<br />north Korean warplanes have been flying near their<br />shared border, and they've detected a short-range<br />ballistic missile launch North Korea launched<br />about 40 ballistic missiles this year, so it<br />wouldn't be uncommon or a surprise for them to do<br />it again very soon.","Audrey Vaughan (30%): Bolsonaro has been behind in<br />the polls, however he is on the rise, and the gap<br />has closed by 10 points over the past 4 months.<br />He was behind by 21 points and how he's only<br />behind by 11. however it may not be enough to win.<br />recently he hasn't made many mistakes but over his<br />term he has gained a lot of negative attention and<br />much of the population dislike him","Joe Ornstein (60%): Without any deep knowledge<br />of UFC, I gotta go with the bookies. Moneyline<br />on Adesanya is is -165, so about a 60% chance of<br />winning.","Joe Ornstein (20%): North Korean missile tests<br />are frequent (a few per month) but they rarely<br />violate South Korean / Japanese airspace. They are<br />typically launched directly into the sea.","Joe Ornstein (20%): The polls have tightened<br />uncomfortably for Lula in the days leading up<br />to the runoff. The Economist poll aggregator<br />(https://www.economist.com/interactive/brazil-2022)<br />has the two candidates within 4 points, and the<br />polls significantly underrated Bolsonaro's support<br />in Round 1. However, I don't believe the Round<br />2 polls will see as big of a miss: for one, it<br />is easier to poll a two-candidate race than a<br />multi-candidate race. Poll respondents are no<br />longer weighing between voting for Bolsonaro<br />or a third party. With many fewer undecideds,<br />the chance of a large polling error decrease.<br />Prediction markets appear to agree, putting<br />Bolsonaro's chances between 25-30%.","Noah Herndon (70%): Israel Adesanya is a the<br />current betting favorite to win the UFC 281 Main<br />event. He became the middleweight champion in 2019<br />and has stayed at the top ever since. Adesanya<br />is undefeated against every middleweight champion<br />he has faced so far, so I think there is a really<br />good chance he stays undefeated. Since he is a<br />stranger to losing and is the betting favorite, I<br />gave him a good chance of winning.","Noah Herndon (20%): The ballistic missile<br />fired over Japan was the first one fired in<br />approximately 5 years, so it would be out of the<br />ordinary if North Korea rapidly fired off another<br />one. Also, if North Korea fired another ballistic<br />missile, it may actually cause conflict this time<br />around because it would be the second in less<br />than two months, and as deranged as North Korea,<br />I don't think they actually want conflict. They<br />just want others to think they are big and bad;<br />they are all bark and no bite. North Korea is<br />also likely to wait until after China holds its<br />Communist party congress this month before they<br />fire off anything else which is why I don't think<br />there is a good chance they fire off another<br />missile over Japan or South Korean airspace.","Noah Herndon (40%): Bolsonaro's opponent Mr. da<br />Silva received the most votes ever in the first<br />round of voting with 57 million. Simone Tebet,<br />who placed third in voting, has indicated that<br />she would endorse da Silva which easily give<br />him enough votes to secure the presidency. And<br />while the voting was close enough to ensure a run<br />off, da Silva still had 48.4% of the votes while<br />Bolsonaro only had 43.2%. So I think da Silva<br />will win, but I am not completely shutting out<br />the possibility of Bolsonaro winning because he<br />received way more votes than he was supposed to<br />receive, so he could possibly surprise again and<br />win the presidency.","David Barrero (65%): Although Israel is the<br />favorite to win the main event, there is history<br />between Israel and Alex with Alex taking the two<br />wins against Israel during their kickboxing days.<br />UFC is a different beast all together and Israel<br />should come out on top, but the two losses could<br />go to his head and result in a surprise defeat<br />which is why his probability to win is not as<br />high.","David Barrero (35%): The last time North Korea<br />launched a ballistic missile over Japan was in<br />2017 and I don't think they will repeat this for<br />a while because of the ramifications a misfire can<br />have on the global scene, but it is more likely<br />that it go over south korean airspace","David Barrero (15%): Bolsonaro's approval rating<br />created by Statista is very low compared to what<br />an average president's with a 28% approval rating.<br />He is also losing in the first round of elections<br />and the third place candidate that was removed<br />from the running leans more towards Bolsonaro's<br />opponent.","Patrick Egan (62%): Israel's money line is about<br />-165, which is around a 62% chance. I don't watch<br />UFC, but Vegas knows what I do not.","Patrick Egan (22%): It's doubtful, because<br />November 12th is rapidly approaching, but the<br />unpredictability of Kim Jung Un with his weapons<br />arsenal makes it a tough call.","Patrick Egan (39%): Lula is definitely the<br />favorite in this election over Bolsonaro, but in<br />an election this close, and with Bolsonaro making<br />a bit of a comeback, it could go either way.","Nicholas Chao (75%): All the odds and predictions<br />on gambling sites have Isreal Adesanya beating his<br />opponent. All the odds are in his favor.","Nicholas Chao (30%): The last missile they<br />launched was 3 weeks ago and from the amount of<br />news coverage it got, I don't see another missile<br />in the next 3 weeks.","Nicholas Chao (20%): From the current poll<br />trackers, Jair is second place to Luiz. Luiz is<br />usually as much as 10% ahead of Jair during the<br />race.","Hannah Jones (63%): He is a very strong<br />competitor. He has defended his belt 5 straight<br />times. He also has never been knocked down in the<br />UFC.","Hannah Jones (82%): They have had 4 launch over in<br />the last week already. Not only that but they will<br />not stop launching missiles anytime soon. They<br />have distinct intent on conflict.","Hannah Jones (45%): The ex-president won the first<br />round of the presidential election. I also think<br />since the current president is right winged, the<br />next elected president will be left winged. this<br />is a pattern seen in many countries including the<br />United States.","Olivia West (40%): Even though Adesanya has been<br />undefeated against every middleweight fighter<br />he’s faced so far, his competition, Pereira,<br />for this fight also shows a very strong ability<br />to win. Furthermore, in his most recent match,<br />which he lost to Jared Cannonier, he displayed<br />indications of decline. For the majority of<br />the game, he played it safe and occasionally<br />lacked inspiration, overall leading to a lower<br />probability that he will win.","Olivia West (80%): Considering that North<br />Korea has already launched 23 missiles in this<br />year alone, I think that there is a very high<br />chance that another one will be launched before<br />November 12th. The likelihood is increased by the<br />possibility that North Korea may launch another<br />missile in retaliation for Kamala Harris's recent<br />statements in support of the United States'<br />extended deterrence obligations to allies in Japan<br />and Korea.","Olivia West (50%): Considering that Jair Bolsonaro<br />won the first round of presidential re-election<br />despite the poll predictions, I'd say there's a<br />decently high chance he could be re-elected as<br />president. Although he won the first round, the<br />probability becomes slightly lower due to the fact<br />he secured 43% of the vote while his competition<br />secured 48%.","Arianna Ycaza (75%): According to a<br />LegitGamblingSites.com, he is undefeated and<br />attempting to defend his title for a seventh<br />consecutive time. Also, the website's algorithm<br />slightly favors him to win over Pereira.","Arianna Ycaza (30%): As of October 4th, North<br />Korea had test launched 5 ballistic missiles in<br />10 days and the most recent one was over Japanese<br />airspace. However, that was the first missile<br />test that was launched over Japan since 2017. The<br />President of South Korea and the Japanese Prime<br />Minister talked with Joe Biden and they all called<br />the action unacceptable, dangerous, and won't<br />allow it to happen again.","Arianna Ycaza (50%): Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,<br />the left-wing candidate, is slightly favored to<br />win in the polls being done by Brazilian news<br />sources and outlets. However, Bolsonaro proved<br />everyone wrong when he came out with 43.2% of the<br />popular vote in the first round of presidential<br />elections when he was very much favored to lose.","Mac Kinnebrew (80%): Israel adesanya has only lost<br />one fight in his UFC career. He is also -170 so he<br />is projected to win.","Mac Kinnebrew (30%): I don’t think they will<br />launch a missile before November 12th because they<br />just recently launched one. North Korea is also<br />very unpredictable so I may be wrong.","Mac Kinnebrew (25%): In the first round of voting<br />he lost to Lula. There is still a chance because<br />he could flip some voters before the final voting.","Andrew Decker (70%): The betting odds favor<br />Israel. He also has only lost one fight in his UFC<br />career which was when he decided to go up a weight<br />class. Israel Adesanya is one of the best MMA<br />fighters in the world right now. The only thing<br />I think Pereira has is that he beat Israel in a<br />match before they were in the UFC.","Andrew Decker (70%): I think it is likely that<br />they will. Within the last month they have fired<br />multiple missiles over Japan and South Korea.","Andrew Decker (35%): I think Lula has better odds.<br />Polling has Lula up around 6 points. I also found<br />a Brazilian website that aggregates polls and they<br />have Lula's odds at 80 percent.","Edward Cox (85%): I have looked on numerous<br />betting sites and looked at both of their records<br />and Adesanya has over double the chances of<br />winning than Pereira. Adesanya seems also to be<br />the returning champ of middleweight boxing. I<br />think he will win.","Edward Cox (65%): I'm really not sure whether<br />they will or not. Im reading that the last time<br />a missile was launched was October 12th but<br />im really not sure. There isn’t a whole lot of<br />information about this where I am looking but I<br />think that the closer we get to the midterms, the<br />more likely he will be to keep launching missiles.","Edward Cox (30%): His approval ratings are in<br />the trash and his opponent isn’t doing much<br />better but enough. He has around a 33% approval<br />rating while his opponent has a 47% approval<br />rating. While looking around, it seems as if Jair<br />Bolsonaro failed to fulfill many promises which<br />he made during his Champagne. Usually, this sinks<br />popularity even though he is again promising to<br />battle inflation in the country. He also seems to<br />be extremely far-right politically and as we have<br />seen, if we have a president who is too far to one<br />side, the people choose the exact opposite which<br />isn’t always a good thing.","Charlie Estabrook (79%): Adesanya is a good<br />fighter and the current odds are in his favor at<br />-165. Adesanya is not a ground fighter at all,<br />but luckily for him his opponent, Pereira, isn't<br />either. There shouldn't be trouble for Adesanya.","Charlie Estabrook (45%): North Korea has not<br />received much stern push back from either the U.S.<br />or S. Korea so I think it wouldn't be crazy for<br />them to try another missile launch soon.","Charlie Estabrook (48%): After reading about this<br />election in Brazil, it is looking similar to the<br />2020 U.S. presidential election. I think Bolosnaro<br />loses and protests the result.","Jeremy Lee (80%): - He has a lot more experience<br />than the opponent - He has a really good record","Jeremy Lee (30%): - They recently launched a<br />missile over Japan and it was the first time<br />in 5 years - Although they test launch a lot of<br />missiles, a majority of them do not tend to be<br />over Japan or South Korea","Jeremy Lee (20%): - Other candidates seem to<br />be ahead in the polls - A lot of articles are<br />mentioning him being overtaken by rivals in<br />opposite parties"],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.55000000000000004,0.089999999999999997,0.80000000000000004,0.69999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0.5,0.75,0.69999999999999996,0.54000000000000004,0.59999999999999998,0.75,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.84999999999999998,0.67000000000000004,0.65000000000000002],"y":[0.96855206904001534,1.0199623706983403,1.0283821435412392,1.0233692563604564,0.9625947042135522,0.95587494422215968,0.95301234549842773,0.96909118420444429,1.0493922747904434,1.018154946807772,0.99356295436155051,1.0388653818983584,0.95541937139350919,1.0316540770931169,0.96230815930757674,1.0472322680754587],"text":["Joseph Kennedy (55%): Trump is planning on<br />announcing that he will run for the 2024<br />presidential election on Thanksgiving of 2022.<br />Trump wants to announce his bid after midterm<br />elections, which ends on November 8th, so I think<br />as soon as that is over, he will announce his bid<br />before 2022 ends. I am unsure if he will anounce<br />it beofre the end of the semester, but I will give<br />him the benefit of the doubt that he will.","Adam Szczupak (9%): In the four most recent<br />presidential races in which there was no<br />incumbent, presidential nominees launched their<br />campaigns an average of 531 days before the<br />election. November 30th 2022 is a little less<br />than two years before the next election, making an<br />announcement for a presidential candidacy rather<br />early, especially when considering the ambiguous<br />nature of whether Biden will run again.","Audrey Vaughan (80%): trump told the new York<br />magazine that he's already made his decision to<br />run again, but he doesn't know if he's making<br />his announcement before or after the November<br />election. even if he announces it after, it will<br />probably be that month of the elections. However,<br />if he launches his campaign before the midterms,<br />it would be easier for him to portray any<br />official investigation against him as politically<br />motivated, so he will probably do so sooner than<br />later.","Joe Ornstein (70%): I'm being a bit bold here,<br />but I think this is pretty likely. Typically,<br />presidential candidates announce their campaigns<br />in the year before the election. For Trump to<br />announce before Thanksgiving would be quite<br />early by historical standards, but there are a<br />few reasons to buck the Outside View here. For<br />one, Trump somewhat famously announced his 2020<br />candidacy *two days* after being sworn into office<br />in 2017. He has also hinted a few times that he'd<br />like to make \"an announcement\" after the midterms,<br />but before Thanksgiving. The optics would be good<br />for him, because it would come on the tails of a<br />likely Republican midterm victory that he could<br />claim credit for, and shift the story away from a<br />few ongoing investigations against him.","Noah Herndon (20%): Most people running for<br />president announce their bid the year before<br />election year. In the past four elections without<br />an incumbent, the potential presidents announced<br />their bids spring of the year before election<br />year. Also, Trump can't even announce his bid for<br />president until after midterm elections due to<br />campaign finance restrictions which would give<br />him a limited time from the end of midterms to<br />November 30th which is why I don't think there is<br />a good chance he announces his bid for the 2024<br />presidential election.","David Barrero (50%): It isn't entirely clear if<br />the former President will announce his bid for<br />presidency soon as I was only able to find one<br />source that says he wants to announce after the<br />midterms but before Thanksgiving.","Patrick Egan (75%): President Donald Trump has<br />said that he will be announcing his intentions<br />shortly after the midterm elections in 2022.<br />There's a lot of days in between then and November<br />30th for him to announce, so I believe he will.","Nicholas Chao (70%): Many articles point to that<br />Trump would announce this fall and maybe even by<br />Thanksgiving. That would be before 11/30, which is<br />the end of the semester.","Hannah Jones (54%): Trump wants his old job<br />back. Not only that but he would wait until after<br />midterms to announce his bid. That happens to be<br />right after thanksgiving which is before november<br />30th.","Olivia West (60%): I'd say there's a good<br />probability Donald Trump will announce his<br />candidacy before Thanksgiving given the repeated<br />statements he has made to his allies and The New<br />York Times about his intentions for a political<br />return and a probable summer launch of another<br />presidential campaign. Also, considering that the<br />2024 election is nearing, I also think that he<br />will announce his bid sooner than later since he<br />has to start campaigning soon.","Arianna Ycaza (75%): Personally, due to his<br />decline in popularity and power through being<br />stripped of various social media platforms, I find<br />it a longshot for Donald Trump to announce him<br />running in the first place. However, according<br />to CBS, KellyAnne Conway, Trump's former advisor,<br />explained that she advised him to wait until after<br />the midterm elections but before Thanksgiving.<br />Thanksgiving will be before November 30th so if<br />he does announce he's running I think it will be<br />before November 30th.","Mac Kinnebrew (30%): Nobody know what truly is<br />going on with Trump so this is kind of a guess. He<br />is under heavy investigation and facing charges so<br />I don’t think he will run.","Andrew Decker (20%): I think it is far too early<br />to announce a bid. The only reason I see him to<br />announce a bid this early is if either Desantis<br />announces or the GOP dominates in the midterms.","Edward Cox (85%): It looks like he has intentions<br />of running again whether that be legal or not by<br />making claims such as “I might have to run again”<br />while speaking about the 2024 elections. Also, his<br />champagne advisor, Kellyanne Conway is saying that<br />he plans on announcing within the next few weeks.<br />Before thanksgiving.","Charlie Estabrook (67%): It is nearly inevitable<br />that he is going to run again. I think one of the<br />only reasons he hasn't formally announced it yet<br />is because he doesn't want any spotlight taken<br />away from these important midterm elections. I<br />see him announcing his bid shortly after midterm<br />elections.","Jeremy Lee (65%): - Trump has been mentioning<br />running for 2024 for quite some time - He has a<br />lot of supporters

It is very<br />difficult to stay undefeated, and I think if<br />they do lose this season, it will be during this<br />stretch.","Audrey Vaughan (80%): Playing the Titans on<br />December 4th is the eagles biggest competition,<br />but other then that they will most likely win the<br />next three to four games. So an undefeated seasons<br />for them is mainly relying on how the game against<br />the titans goes. the Eagles are 7-0 whereas the<br />titans are 5-2 so even though the titans will be<br />their biggest competition, they will most likely<br />win.","Patrick Egan (22%): The Eagles are overrated, but<br />the teams coming up on their schedule kinda blow,<br />so although its likely they lose, I can't confirm<br />anything.","Andrew Decker (50%): The eagles have a cupcake<br />schedule. That being said, it is tough to win in<br />the NFL and upsets are very common. I think the<br />most likely upset would be to the Commanders.","Nicholas Chao (0%): There are 6 more games before<br />the end of the semester. Even though the Eagles<br />are really strong, I do not see them winning all 6<br />of them, having a 14-0 record.","Ian Driggers (70%): The eagles are favored in all<br />their next 3 games which puts us at the end of the<br />semester.","Edward Cox (10%): They are going to play some<br />pretty good teams and this season when their whole<br />schedule has been hot ass.","Adam Szczupak (21%): Although the Eagles have<br />one of the easiest schedules according to both<br />the NFL and PFF rankings, the odds on draft<br />kings that they go the remainder of the season<br />undefeated currently lies at 25 to 1 (3.85 implied<br />probability), the semester ends in 5 weeks. The<br />matchups for the eagles during this time all<br />parlayed together give +362 odds or an implied<br />probability of 21.28 percent.","Jeremy Lee (30%): - Although the Eagles are the<br />only team right now to be undefeated, it's rare<br />that any NFL team goes undefeated during the<br />regular season - They've have won a lot of games<br />by a single point or even a field goal, so I<br />believe they have a good chance of at least losing<br />1 game","David Barrero (5%): The first half of the<br />Eagles' schedule has been fairly easy as it was<br />deemed that their strength of schedule is the<br />second lowest in the whole league. Even with a<br />weaker schedule the Eagles have still struggled<br />throughout and will eventually lose as they have<br />three big divisional matchups, 2 against the<br />Giants and 1 against the Cowboys. It is also<br />extremely rare for a team to go undefeated as the<br />last team to do so were the 2007 Patriots.","Joe Ornstein (65%): There are three more Eagles<br />games left between now and the end of the<br />semester. The Vegas odds give them a roughly 80%<br />chance of beating the Washington Commanders next<br />week, and the other two teams have even worse<br />records than Washington! So let's say 0.8 x 0.9 x<br />0.9 = 65%","Arianna Ycaza (50%): Based on my research, the<br />Eagles are favored to go undefeated for the<br />rest of the season but it honestly just seems<br />very unlikely for an NFL team to go completely<br />undefeated for an entire season, especially when<br />they upped it to 17 weeks.","Noah Herndon (90%): I think the Eagles have a<br />very high chance of still being undefeated by the<br />end of the semester. Their next game is against<br />the Washington Commanders who they have already<br />beaten, so I don't think they will have a problem<br />with doing that again. Their next game after that<br />is against the Colts who are 3-5-1. The Colts are<br />having a bad season and have no real quarterback;<br />their last game was a 26-3 loss to the patriots.<br />Next, they must face the Packers. Aaron Rodgers<br />should've retired last year because the Packers<br />have lost 5 straight games, and I don't think<br />their losing streak will end with the Eagles if it<br />is still alive.","Meredith Stevens (75%): currently they are 8-0<br />which is good but they still have a long way to go<br />with some tough competition coming. The Giants are<br />6-2 so the eagles should win but the Giants have<br />been playing above their heads all season long.<br />They also have Saquon Barkley who should be good<br />at beating and tackling the eagles defense.","Olivia West (70%): Considering that the Eagles<br />have already had a fairly good playing season<br />and are ranked #1 in the NFL, I think they have a<br />fairly high chance to stay undefeated by the end<br />of the semester. Also, the next three teams that<br />they play before the end of the semester haven't<br />had as good season as the Eagles, making the<br />chances even higher.","Mac Kinnebrew (5%): It is very rare for NFL teams<br />to go undefeated in the regular season. The Eagles<br />are also a team that is not talented enough to go<br />undefeated.","Charlie (32%): The NFL is very unpredictable<br />compared to college football. It is very very rare<br />for an NFL team to go undefeated and November is a<br />big month for upset losses in the NFL","hannah jones (70%): They are a very strong team.<br />Their next three games are \"easy\" compared to the<br />other games they have won."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-down","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,0)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,0)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.69999999999999996,0.20000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.90000000000000002,0.67000000000000004,0.66000000000000003,0.75,0.59999999999999998,0.5,0.76000000000000001,0.80000000000000004,0.65000000000000002,0.75,0.27000000000000002,0.029999999999999999,0.78000000000000003,0.80000000000000004,0.59999999999999998,0.55000000000000004,0.45000000000000001,0.20999999999999999,0.29999999999999999,0.20000000000000001,0.29999999999999999,0.40000000000000002,0.20000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.10000000000000001,0.59999999999999998,0.20000000000000001,0.69999999999999996,0.10000000000000001,0.68000000000000005,0.80000000000000004,0.40000000000000002,0.63],"y":[1.9812737646512688,0.96385560254566371,1.9848433027975261,1.0356931547634303,2.0477353414054962,1.0163959557656199,1.977671535522677,1.0131435506744311,1.9871422001859174,1.0181005667895078,1.9974967014277354,0.95043030176311727,2.0432993975235147,0.97075345972552896,2.0076006172690541,1.0165389746427536,1.9901084528770299,0.99207817332353443,1.9940076559549198,0.96007446669973429,1.9719705196563155,0.99772549716290082,2.0301108684157954,0.96471947475802156,2.0382458767620846,1.0078892968595028,2.0195165037410332,0.99810641205403949,2.0470362172694876,1.0078276047250256,2.0192706203553827,0.96266909998375927,1.9773470949847252,1.0442784968065097,2.0047774416860191,0.98029501503333449],"text":["Joe Kennedy (70%): For a runoff to occur, one of<br />either walker or warnock needs to get at least<br />50% of the votes, and as of now, this doesn't look<br />like this will happen.","Joe Kennedy (20%): Elon says trump will not be<br />on twitter before midterms. I think Trump will<br />be back on twitter, but not before the semester<br />ends since there will be only a few weeks for then<br />trump to be back on twitter. I do not know if Elon<br />wants to do somehting so riskey so fast aswell.","Audrey Vaughan (60%): Warnock has 49% support of<br />survey respondents, while walker has 47% and the<br />rest is an independent party, so as of right now<br />and based on surveys, they would be going into a<br />runoff. Although many websites and surveys have<br />these similar results, they all very slightly, and<br />cant fully depict an accurate result.","Audrey Vaughan (90%): One of the reasons for Elon<br />Musk buying twitter was to give the social media<br />platform full \"freedom of speech\" so bringing<br />trump back to twitter will definitely be a high<br />priority. Elon Musk also discussed Trumps ban<br />and allowing him to return if he was able to buy<br />twitter, and now that he has bought it, a large<br />portion of twitter users are waiting for Trump to<br />return. Along with this, when the election results<br />come out trump will have a lot to say, and Musk<br />probably wants him to be back on his account for<br />that.","Patrick Egan (67%): Georgia is a very competitive<br />state and this election is expected to be<br />extremely close, so a runoff seems likely.","Patrick Egan (66%): Elon Musk acts fast, and I<br />feel this will be one of his earliest actions.<br />Only time will tell if he gets it in before the<br />end of the semester, though.","Andrew Decker (75%): 538 gives pretty good odds<br />of going to a runoff. Last year there was also<br />a runoff. I also think with the polarization of<br />both candidates, there might a surge for 3rd party<br />candidates.","Andrew Decker (60%): Im conflicted on this one.<br />Trump is apparently supposed to announce his bid<br />for 2024 in the next week. If he does, I could<br />see him getting back on twitter. The only thing<br />keeping me from saying 100 percent is the issue<br />of advertisers dropping twitter over the move. I<br />think it could go either way on this issue.","Nicholas Chao (50%): Many sources and their<br />research has estimated that there will not be a<br />runoff, but by current standings, both are around<br />the 45% area. This is not as near to 50% as they<br />would like which may or may not lead to a runoff.","Nicholas Chao (76%): Elon Musk hints that he would<br />bring back Donald Trump and other banned accounts<br />with him owning Twitter. He states that they will<br />not be back before the midterm elections, but will<br />be back on the platform.","Ian Driggers (80%): Chase Oliver is projected to<br />get 1-2 percent of voters and both candidates were<br />projected around 48% so I think it will go into a<br />runoff","Ian Driggers (65%): Elon musk said that banned<br />accounts won’t get resorted until after the<br />election and he mentioned that trumps name was on<br />that list","Edward Cox (75%): Seeing the divide between the<br />candidates, it is projected that walker will be<br />leading even just a little bit but I heavily doubt<br />either will receive over 50% of the votes.","Edward Cox (27%): He seems to have a lot more<br />on his plate and many sources say that it won’t<br />be for another few weeks. I definitely don’t<br />think it is his main priority to get Trump back<br />onto twitter but I think it will happen at the<br />beginning of next year along with facebook’s 2<br />year ban for him.","Adam Szczupak (3%): The Libertarian Candidate has<br />little to no support. Unless the election comes<br />down to a mere few thousand votes, it will not be<br />in a runoff.","Adam Szczupak (78%): Elon Musk has already<br />announced that he plans to reinstate his account,<br />the only uncertainty lies in if Donald Trump<br />will activate said account, as he has publicly<br />stated he will remain on his social media platform<br />\"Truth\".","Jeremy Lee (80%): - As the election date gets<br />closer, the polls in FiveThirtyEight show that<br />they are really close to each other with Warnock<br />at 46.7% and Walker at 47.7% - It's hard to tell<br />who will win because Georgia went into a runoff<br />election last time as well. Typically being a red<br />state, Georgia was voted blue two years ago","Jeremy Lee (60%): - Elon Musk stated that he would<br />reinstate all of the suspended/banned accounts but<br />it would have to wait until after the midterms -<br />Musk strongly believes that banning accounts isn't<br />right and wants Trump to get his account back","David Barrero (55%): The race in question is<br />extremely tight with a few percentages separating<br />the two candidates and with having to have 50%<br />it can't be said either one will have the needed<br />amount.","David Barrero (45%): Elon Musk has fired the<br />previous head of legal and privacy which was<br />deemed as the one responsible for taking Trump off<br />the site in the first place. He did say that their<br />would be no decision made until a new team in<br />charge of viewpoint convened so it just up to what<br />happens in the next few days.","Joe Ornstein (21%): To go to a runoff, the<br />margin between Walker and Warnock must be smaller<br />than the share of the vote going to third party<br />candidates (expected to be somewhere in the<br />neighborhood of 1.5%). In the FiveThirtyEight<br />model of the Georgia Senate race, this occurs 21<br />out of 100 times.","Joe Ornstein (30%): Quite possible, but unlikely.<br />Following the acquisition and layoffs, Musk<br />is actively trying to reassure advertisers<br />that Twitter isn't going to become a giant<br />TruthSocial/8chan. The strongest signal he could<br />send on that front would be to maintain the Trump<br />ban. Plus, the two had a bit of a falling out over<br />the summer, with Trump calling Musk a \"bulls#&t<br />artist\" and Musk tweeting that Trump should \"hang<br />up his hat & sail into the sunset\". I doubt Musk's<br />ego will allow him to forgive that anytime soon,<br />especially if there is Twitter ad revenue on the<br />line.","Arianna Ycaza (20%): No, I think that it will be a<br />close race but ultimately by tomorrow we will know<br />who one and I think one candidate or the other<br />will get over 50%","Arianna Ycaza (30%): According to CNN, Elon Musk<br />said he doesn’t plan on giving Trump his account<br />back before the midterm elections. This makes me<br />think that his motives are to avoid Trump taking<br />politics, so I think he will get his account back<br />eventually but not until after this semester.","Noah Herndon (40%): This election is a highly<br />polarized topic. You are either voting for Warnock<br />or Walker which means a vote for a third party<br />candidate is basically a vote against Warnock or<br />Walker respectfully. I don't think it will go to a<br />runoff, but I gave it a 40% because I still think<br />there is a decent chance considering that Warnock<br />and Loeffler went to a runoff election. Also, I'm<br />sure everyone is tired of seeing Warnock or Walker<br />ads literally everywhere, so maybe everyone will<br />just vote for one or the other to ensure that<br />there is no runoff election.","Noah Herndon (20%): On November 2nd, Elon Musk<br />said it would be a few more weeks before those<br />permanently banned on Twitter would be able to<br />have their account reinstated. Also, it has been<br />over ten days since Elon Musk officially owned<br />twitter and in that time Trump's account has not<br />been reinstated. If it hasn't by now, I think it<br />will be reinstated after the semester ends if at<br />all.","Meredith Stevens (60%): There is a possibility<br />since recent statistics from a poll in October<br />show Walker with 46% and Warnock with 48% neither<br />of them reaching a over 50%. As of Nov 6th fox<br />5 released a poll showing Walker with 49% and<br />Warnock with 47% support. Walker is very close to<br />receive majority but it is still unknown.","Meredith Stevens (10%): In my opinion no because<br />Elon has hinted that Donald Trump will not be<br />back on twitter before the midterms. According to<br />CNN Musck confirmed that “twitter will not allow<br />anyone who was deplatformed for violating twitter<br />rules back on platform until we have clear process<br />for doing so, which will take at least a few more<br />weeks.”","Olivia West (60%): Considering that the popular<br />vote has lead to 49.3 percent for Walker and 49.2<br />percent for Warnock, I think there is a fairly<br />high chance that the Senate election will go into<br />a runoff. Also, Georgia law requires candidates<br />to receive a majority vote to win the election,<br />making 49.3 percent not high enough and a higher<br />chance of there being a runoff.","Olivia West (20%): Considering that Elon Musk made<br />a statement that banned twitter accounts will not<br />be reinstated until a couple weeks after midterm<br />elections (November 8th), I think there's a fairly<br />low chance that Donald Trump's twitter will be<br />reinstated before the end of the semester. Musk<br />further claimed that anybody who has been banned<br />from the social media site for breaking content<br />guidelines won't be let back until a procedure for<br />doing so has been established, and that procedure<br />won't even be developed for a few weeks.","Mac Kinnebrew (70%): A runoff is pretty common in<br />these types of elections. This is also a pretty<br />tightly projected race.","Mac Kinnebrew (10%): I do not think it will be<br />reinstated because it has been a while since he's<br />been on. I also don't think hes trying to get back<br />on anymore.","Charlie (68%): This race is going to be very close<br />and I can definitely see it going into a runoff.","Charlie (80%): Elon will definitely allow him<br />back on twitter I think. There is a chance in my<br />opinion that Trump decides not to go back on if he<br />is allowed to and continue pushing Truth.","hannah jones (40%): it has not been close at all<br />prior to elections today. I also just dont foresee<br />a runoff because one of the two will win by a<br />little more than the other due to favor from the<br />other party votes.","hannah jones (63%): elon musk just bought twitter<br />so i find this highly possible. musk said he<br />wanted freedom of speech to be used on twitter. he<br />is in favor of giving trump his account back so it<br />is likely."],"type":"scatter","mode":"markers","marker":{"autocolorscale":false,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)","opacity":0.5,"size":5.6692913385826778,"symbol":"triangle-up","line":{"width":1.8897637795275593,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"}},"hoveron":"points","name":"(FALSE,1)","legendgroup":"(FALSE,1)","showlegend":true,"xaxis":"x","yaxis":"y","hoverinfo":"text","frame":null},{"x":[0.42999999999999999],"y":[3.0479117136448624],"text":"Class
