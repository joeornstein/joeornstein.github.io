Poor people in their apartment buildings can’t be far from the street car lines.\n\nThis is pre-zoning, so the Astors and Vanderbilts can’t keep slaughterhouses away from their grand houses by making it illegal. Instead, they simply build their houses here, where you can still ride a carriage to get downtown, but away from the street cars and elevated railways and docks. (Historical path dependence alert! The Upper East Side is still the place where all the New York old money live today, despite the original reason for living there disappearing.)"

Only a few hundred thousand lived in city-states.\n\nHistory focuses on these places because they’re the ones that leave archaeological records, but the vast bulk of humanity didn’t live in cities.\nThat started to change only recently."

(Pronounced “TEE-bow”).\n\nCompetition between local governments is the public-sector analogue to the private-sector market.\n\nAn efficient outcome can be reached through decentralized, individual decisions. No politics necessary! 😅\n\nIn a diverse polity, people with different preferences for public goods can sort themselves into jurisdictions best matching their preferences.\nBecause public goods exhibit economies of scale (Blom-Hansen, Houlberg, and Serritzlew 2014), local governments have an incentive to compete to attact new residents, lowering average costs.\n\nLike private firms, local governments are pressured to keep costs (taxes) low in order to successfully compete for residents.\n\n\nWhat important things are left out of this model?"

Grab a card to figure out how much money you have.\nMayors: instead of “lump sum” taxes, you must now set tax rates in percentage terms. What percent of each resident’s income are you taxing?\nIt costs $50 to move from one town to another (or to secede/amalgamate). Just deduct it from your money total whenever you move.\n\nThat’s it! I’ll give you another 10 minutes to make yourselves as happy as possible.\nGo!"

    "text": "Simulation 2: Debrief\n\nWhat happened?\nPerhaps things played out a bit differently when we added some friction to the idealized model:\n\nWhen income is heterogeneous, taxes are inherently redistributive.\nThis pressures people to sort not just on preferences, but on income as well.\nMoving costs limit the ability of poor households to integrate with rich households.\n\nIn practice, such costs include more than just the physical costs of moving (Hamilton 1975; Derenoncourt 2022)."

Well, it depends what you want to achieve…\nThe Tiebout (1956) model (Simulation 1) suggests that some types of public spending are best handled by competing local governments:\n\nLots of preference diversity\nLimited economies of scale\nNo “spillovers” across geographic boundaries\n\nResidential mobility limits the types of public spending that is feasible for local governments, particularly redistribution (Simulation 2).\nTax competition for mobile capital can yield a “Race to the Bottom” (Simulation 3).\n\nScholars disagree on how good a model this is of local tax incentives (Jensen, Malesky, and Walsh 2015).\nBut it’s a very good model of the competition for sports stadiums!\nMore on that in the Deep Dives."
