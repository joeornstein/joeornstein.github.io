During our final week, your group will present a summary of the case and your proposed solution. Make sure that your presentation is informed by and reflects a thorough understanding of the relevant scientific literature we introduced during the semester.\r\nCase Study 1: Mall Redevelopment\r\nLike many indoor shopping malls throughout the country, the Georgia Square Mall in west Athens has gone through a long period of decline. In March 2023, the Athens-Clarke County Commission approved a plan to redevelop the mall area. Describe and evaluate this plan. What is the extent of public subsidy and how is it being paid for? (What the heck is a TAD?) What is the likely effect of the redevelopment on housing and transportation in the county?\r\nCase Study 2: Athens’ Missing Middle\r\nIn 2022, Athens-Clarke County commissioned a report on opportunities to increase the amount of “Missing Middle” housing built in the county. Consider this report in light of the research on housing policy we’ve discussed. What would be the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed plan? What are the likely political barriers to implementing it? What changes would you make?\r\nCase Study 3: Urban Renewal\r\nCities large and small were radically transformed by Urban Renewal in the mid-20th century, and Athens is no exception. What parts of Athens were targeted by Urban Renewal and why? What is life like in these places half a century later? What is being done and what more should be done? For some jumping off points, see The Story Behind Linnentown and the North Downtown Athens page.\r\nCase Study 4: Public Outreach\r\nThe Athens-Clarke County government will frequently solicit public feedback on its initiatives (you have probably seen posters with QR codes linking to surveys like the one below).\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know is…who responds to these things? Are these QR codes an effective method for spurring local political participation? And does the county government actually use the feedback to guide its planning? Or is it just window dressing? (For this case study, you may actually have to talk with somebody who knows the answers.)\r\nCase Study 5: Districting\r\nFollowing the 2020 Census, the Georgia General Assembly passed HB 890, which redrew the Athens-Clarke County commission districts (and drew several members of the commission out of their seats). What are the consequences (good or bad) of this new set of district maps? Should Athens-Clarke County elect its commissioners at-large, like neighboring Oconee County?\r\nCase Study 6: Vertical Fragmentation\r\nAthens consolidated with Clarke County in the 1990s, reducing vertical fragmentation. What were the effects of this consolidation? Should other counties in Georgia follow its example? Why or why not? Would you favor a proposal to consolidate the Clarke County School District with Athens-Clarke County?\r\nCase Study 7: Active Transportation\r\nIn 2018, Athens-Clarke County approved the Athens In Motion plan for the city’s bike/pedestrian network, and has been incrementally building out the proposed network in the years since. What are the likely benefits and costs of pursuing this project? What political challenges do its proponents face? What changes would you suggest?\r\nCase Study 8: Parking Reform\r\nThere has been a movement in cities around the country to eliminate off-street parking mandates in zoning codes. Would a reform like this be beneficial in Athens? What might some drawbacks be in this particular case?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
