Why do cities exist, and what do they do for us anyway? We’ll introduce some fundamental concepts in the field of urban economics, including economies of scale, agglomeration effects, congestion costs, and path dependence. We’ll discuss the historical emergence of cities and the explosion of urbanization around the globe.\r\nDiscussion Questions\r\nWhy do cities exist?\r\nWhere did widespread urbanization occur prior to the Industrial Revolution, and why?\r\nWhat is likely to happen to cities in the aftermath of the pandemic?\r\nWhat is path dependence? How does it affect the development and governance of cities?\r\nWhy are some cities in strange places?\r\nWhat explains the tremendous growth of “primate cities” in the developing world (e.g. Bangkok, Jakarta, Kinshasa, Mexico City)?\r\nHow has China achieved such rapid urbanization, and what are the effects of this massive internal migration on Chinese politics and society?\r\nIs urbanization helpful or harmful for global poverty?\r\nReadings\r\nBooks\r\nGlaeser, Edward. 2014.
