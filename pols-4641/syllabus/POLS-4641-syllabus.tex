%% PREAMBLE %%
\onehalfspacing

% Loosely guessed from this: https://www.sciencealert.com/half-the-world-s-population-lives-on-1-of-its-land

\noindent Over half of the Earth's population lives within the sea of city lights visible on the satellite map above. These cities are the centers of global commerce and culture, but in order to function, they require effective governance. Cities need roads, schools, police, fire protection, parks, buses, sewers, and electricity. Many of our most pressing political problems --- including education, criminal justice reform, housing, and climate change --- are in large part problems of city politics.

In this course, we will explore what makes cities tick, and how research from political science, economics, sociology, psychology, and mathematics can help us build cities that are healthier, safer, fairer, and more livable for their residents. We'll begin with foundational research on the origins of cities and how best to govern them, then discuss some of the specific policy challenges faced by cities today, and end the semester with a few questions about the future of cities, both in the US and worldwide.

\section*{Course Structure}

The class will meet twice a week, and each class period will be devoted to a particular topic. At the beginning of the semester, we will split the class into teams of five or six students. Every day, one member from each team will be responsible for researching that days' topic and writing a paper that serves as a \textbf{Table Read} for the class session. Class time will be structured like a  \href{https://medium.com/swlh/the-silent-meeting-manifesto-v1-189e9e3487eb}{Silent Meeting}, where we take time to read our fellow students' papers and offer comments and suggestions. These comments will both motivate class discussion and help the students revise their papers for final submission. Our agenda for most class days will look like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction (5 minutes)
\item Table Read (15 minutes)
\item Team Discussion and Revisions (20 minutes)
\item Class Discussion (20 minutes)
\item Closing Thoughts (5 minutes)
\end{enumerate}

Each team will be responsible for dividing up the paper topics. You can find the complete list of course topics and their associated readings on the website. Papers should be roughly 2000-3000 words (about 6 pages), short enough to read in 10-15 minutes. After your table read, you have 24 hours to make any revisions and submit the paper. Late papers will be marked down a full letter grade per 24 hours.
 
Why structure the course this way? Well, originally it was an on-the-fly adjustment to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the structure proved popular and enduring, because it offers a few nice benefits:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It sure beats sitting for an hour and getting talked at.
	\item Everyone does the reading. We're literally on the same page when it comes time for class discussion.
	\item Your papers don't just get skimmed by your professor and discarded; they're the primary way your peers will learn about the material that day, which makes writing a paper for class less pointless.
	\item Everyone gets detailed feedback on their work and a chance to improve.
	\item Everyone can contribute during class, regardless of background knowledge or comfort with public speaking. (I, for example, tend to get nervous when asked to speak in front of 45 of my peers, but Iâ€™m happy making comments on a Google Doc. Perhaps you are like me.)
	\item The class project isn't something that gets tacked on at the end of the semester. Researching and writing your papers will be your primary intellectual activity during the course.
\end{itemize}

\noindent During the Table Read portion of class, take time to first read the paper from beginning to end, then go back and add comments, questions, and suggestions for edits in the margins of the shared document. Don't worry that criticism will harm your peers' grades! Quite the opposite. If you frame your critiques as suggestions, it can only help them improve the draft and get a better grade upon final submission (due 24 hours after the Table Read). Your comments can take any form: grammatical edits, suggestions for how to make a point more clearly, clarification questions, flags for further discussion, and points of agreement/disagreement. And don't forget: positive feedback is just as important as negative feedback! If you read something that was thought-provoking or interesting, highlight it!

Once the silent portion of class is over, we will have a more traditional ``loud'' discussion, focusing on deeper questions brought up during the Table Read.

%\section*{COVID-19 Precautions}
%
%Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I expect that there will be more than the usual share of setbacks and hardships this semester. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or reach out to me with your concerns. Our classroom will have a limited capacity (18 students), so if you would prefer to attend our sessions in-person, let me know when you send me your introductory email (details in the Course Topics section). If there are more students that prefer to meet in-person than capacity allows, I will divide the class into sections.
%
%If you show any \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=covid-19+symptoms}{symptoms of COVID-19} or have been exposed to someone who tests positive for COVID-19, don't come to class in-person. Obviously. Everyone will have the option to attend our class sessions in-person or over Zoom, so you will not miss out on anything if you attend remotely. I will also hold virtual office hours after each class session.
%
%When you come to class, please wear a mask. The University System of Georgia (USG) requires all faculty, students, and staff to wear appropriate face coverings while inside campus buildings. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at \href{https://drc.uga.edu/}{https://drc.uga.edu/}. For more information on the University of Georgia's coronavirus response, visit \href{https://coronavirus.uga.edu/}{https://coronavirus.uga.edu/}. 

\section*{Grading}

During the semester, I will select three of your papers at random to grade, and your final grade will be the average of those three paper grades. I have high standards for the papers you submit, because your classmates will be relying on your paper to help understand the topic that day. In other classes, bad papers might be painful for the professors who read them, but they don't actually \textit{harm} anyone. In this class, they do! So I expect your effort to be commensurate with that responsibility. My rubric for grading papers looks like this:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A}: This is a \textit{really good} paper. It could be published for a wider audience with minimal revision, and people would be made better off by reading it. It's fun to read, it effectively teaches the concepts, and it accurately portrays the scientific research.
	\item \textbf{A-}: This is a good paper. With some minor revisions, it could be published for a wider audience. It effectively teaches the concepts and accurately portrays the scientific research. 
	\item \textbf{B+}: Your paper ``meets the brief''. It teaches the concepts and does not contain anything misleading or inaccurate. It falls short of an A- due to an organizational or stylistic problem that makes it difficult to read, or perhaps the omission of an important concept.
	\item \textbf{B}: Your paper ``meets the brief'', but would require significant revisions before I would recommend it to a wider audience. It teaches the concepts and does not contain anything misleading or inaccurate. However, it contains a number of organizational or stylistic problems that make it difficult to read and/or it omits a number of important concepts.
	\item \textbf{B-}: Your paper ``meets the brief'', but would require significant revisions before I would recommend it to a wider audience. It teaches the concepts and does not contain anything misleading or inaccurate. However, it contains a number of organizational or stylistic problems that make it difficult to read and it omits a number of important concepts.
	\item \textbf{C}: Your paper fails to meet the brief. It contains misleading or inaccurate information, is difficult to understand, and/or omits enough important information that it does not help other students understand the topic. It would need significant revisions to be a good Table Read.
	\item \textbf{F}: Somehow worse than a C.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Office Hours}

I will be available for office hours by appointment, and you can sign up for 15 minute slots through the course website.

With each paper draft, you'll simultaneously be learning new content \textit{and} trying to teach others what you've learned. This is a difficult cognitive task! I strongly recommend that you sign up for office hours before your table read is due so we can discuss any questions you have about the material you're reading. Even if you don't have a problem with the material, stop by office hours anyway! One of the great things about college is that your professors are all required to set aside time each week just to talk with their students. And, not to brag, but I'm \textit{pretty good at talking}. My job title (Assistant Professor) is basically just Latin for ``Assistant Talker''.

%\section*{Course Topics}
%
%Ultimately, the content that we cover will depend on what questions you decide to write about. Below is a list of suggested paper topics, and I will provide a set of readings for each topic on the course \href{https://uga.view.usg.edu/d2l/home/2213495}{eLC page}. Take a few minutes to read over the prompts below and decide which you would most like to address in your paper. Then send me an email introducing yourself and ranking your top 10 choices. (If you'd like to suggest your own topic, please do! We'll work together to compile a good reading list.) Once I've assigned everyone's topics, I will post a schedule for the semester.
%
%\textbf{Note:} I will write the Table Reads for the first two weeks of class, so no one is given too tight a deadline, and so you get a chance to read some examples of the kind of papers that I expect.
