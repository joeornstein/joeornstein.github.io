Our cities are sorted by:

- Political Party

- Race & Income

- Function




# Partisan Sorting

Start with the Biden-or-Trump street view game.




# Segregation

Start with recall your childhood home. If you were to randomly pick 10 neighbors out of a hat, how many of them would look like you? How many would be the same race?
Google form that.
(How many would be the same economic class?)




# Zoning

How many people have played SimCity? Or something similar? 
First thing you do is create *zones*. A residential zone where people can live. A commercial zone where people can buy stuff. An industrial zone where people can make stuff.
But the idea of separating cities into zones on a map is a thoroughly modern invention, and there's good reason to believe that it's unhealthy for our cities.
