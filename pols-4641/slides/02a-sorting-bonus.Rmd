## Question

- Why, anecdotally, does it seem like "the south side" often contains the poorest neighborhoods of a city?

--

- Is this true generally in the United States?

--

- If so, *why??*

--

- Could it have something to do with geographic features?

  - People prefer not to be downstream / downwind of manufacturing? 
  
  - If so, we'd expect the poor side of town to frequently line up with the direction of flow of the city's river.

## Data Collection

In the 50 largest cities in the United States, here's the neighborhood geometry breakdown:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(janitor)
library(ggrepel)

d <- read_xlsx('data/rough-side.xlsx') |>
  clean_names()


d |>
  count(rough_side) |>
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n) * 100) |>
  arrange(pct) |>
  rename(` ` = rough_side, `Num. Cities` = n, `%` = pct) |>

```
]

.pull-right[
**South Side:** `r d |> filter(rough_side == 'south') |> pull(city)`

**North Side:** `r d |> filter(rough_side == 'north') |> pull(city)`

**East Side:** `r d |> filter(rough_side == 'east') |> pull(city)`

**West Side:** `r d |> filter(rough_side == 'west') |> pull(city)`

## Data Analysis

How *weird* is it that there are only 4 cities with poor west sides, but 17 cities with poor south sides? 

--

This is where probability and statistics comes in handy.

- Is this a pattern you wouldn't expect to observe by chance alone?

--

So we create a thought experiment:

![](img/d4.gif)

--

Repeat that 42 times (one for each city with an obvious geographic divide):

--

```{r}

# roll 1d4
d4 <- function(){
  return(sample(c('north', 'south', 'east', 'west'), size = 1))
}

# roll 42 d4s
num_with_direction <- d |> filter(rough_side != 'center') |> nrow()

get_min <- function(){

  replicate(num_with_direction, d4()) |>
    table() |>
    min()
}

get_max <- function(){

  replicate(num_with_direction, d4()) |>
    table() |>
    max()
}

replicate(num_with_direction, d4()) |>
  table() |> 
  sort()

```

---

## Data Analysis

If you repeat that exercise over and over, generating 10,000 sets of 42 randomly generated cities, how often are there only four cities with poor west sides?

```{r}
num_west <- d |> filter(rough_side == 'west') |> nrow()
sampling_distribution <- replicate(1e4, get_min())

pval <- sum(sampling_distribution <= num_west) / length(sampling_distribution)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x=sampling_distribution)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = 'count', color = 'black', mapping = aes(fill = sampling_distribution <= num_west)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = seq(2,12, 2)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = 'Number of Cities With Poor West Sides',
       y = 'Frequency',
       caption = paste0('p = ', round(pval, 2))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('gray', 'red')) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

---

## Data Analysis

And what's the chance that you at least 17 cities with poor south sides?

```{r}
num_south <- d |> filter(rough_side == 'south') |> nrow()
get_max <- function(){

  replicate(num_with_direction, d4()) |>
    table() |>
    max()
}

sampling_distribution <- replicate(1e4, get_max())

pval <- sum(sampling_distribution >= num_south) / length(sampling_distribution)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x=sampling_distribution)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = 'count', color = 'black', mapping = aes(fill = sampling_distribution >= num_south)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = 'Number of Cities With Poor South Sides',
       y = 'Frequency',
       caption = paste0('p = ', round(pval, 2))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('gray', 'red')) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

## Data Collection: River Flow

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('img/google-rivers.png')
```

## Data Analysis: River Flow

- Are poor neighborhoods more likely to be downriver? We can use similar statistical methods to answer this question.

--

- To be extra generous to the hypothesis, if a river flows "southwest", I'll count both the south and west of the city as being downriver. 

  - This means there's a roughly 3/8 chance that river flow and neighborhood orientation line up.

--

Here are the actual results (out of 39 cities with major rivers flowing through them):

```{r}
d |>
  filter(!is.na(river_direction)) |>
  mutate(match = if_else(str_detect(river_direction, rough_side), 'yes', 'no')) |> 
  count(match) |> 
  rename(`Downriver?` = match, `Num. Cities` = n) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

--

I leave the full statistical analysis as an exercise to the reader.

---

## Conclusion

- As best I can tell, the poor side of US cities is most likely to be the south side, but not more likely than chance alone would suggest.

  - More data and more careful measurement could resolve the question more definitively.
  
--

- There is no clear tendency for the poor side of a city to be downriver.

--

- There is some [interesting evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/may/12/blowing-wind-cities-poor-east-ends) that cities in England are more likely to have poor *east* sides, perhaps due to the direction of prevailing winds.
