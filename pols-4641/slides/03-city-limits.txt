Is this too many? Too few? What are the consequences of having so many overlapping sources of political power?

Is it good or bad that we have so many governments? Unfortunately, it's too complicated for me to say with any great certainty.
Instead, today I'm going to show you that there are some ways in which fragmentation is Good, some ways in which it's bad, and some ways it gets Ugly.




Good:
- Tiebout Sorting
- Tax Competition / Leviathan Hypothesis(?) / Not sure the current thinking here, but we can default to Rodden (2003).

Bad:
- Coordination Problems, Vertical Fragmentation, Special Districts, Inefficiencies (Dutch Amalgamation)
- Trains

Ugly:
- Race to the bottom, incentives to pander, city limits, stadiums
  - Kansas City, prisoner's dilemma
