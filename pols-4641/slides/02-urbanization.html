## Urbanization

--

By our [best estimates](https://www.un.org/en/dayof8billion), the world's population reached 8 billion in November 2022.

--

The majority of these people live in cities.

$$
\frac{3.35 \text{ billion}}{60 \text{y} \times 365.25 \text{d} \times 24\text{h} \times 60\text{m} \times 60\text{s}} \approx 2
$$
???

Roughly 2 people added to cities per *second* over a period of 60 years!

## Urbanization

For all the reasons we discussed in Module 1, cities create economic opportunities. Urbanized countries tend to be wealthier.

In the animation, highlight in particular the different trajectories of India and China. India started wealthier on average than China. Now the average Indian is half as wealthy as the average Chinese person, and half as many live in cities. Not a coincidence!

# Theory

## Theory

When should we expect a country to **urbanize**?

--

To get some intuition, let's consider a stripped-down version of the mathematical model in .cite[Krugman (1991)]:

--

.pull-left[
  
- Three villages: A, B, and C

- `\(N\)` people total. `\(F\)` people are farmers. `\(N-F\)` are weavers.

- It costs $1 for a solitary weaver to make a shirt.

- There are **scale economies**. It only costs $(1 - c) to make a shirt if all the weavers work together in one place.

- It costs `\(T\)` to transport a shirt to another village.

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/krugman.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

## Theory

When does make sense to produce all the shirts in one location and ship them to the other locations?

--

$$
(1-c)N + TF &lt; 1N
$$

---

## Theory

When does make sense to produce all the shirts in one location and ship them to the other locations?

`$$\underbrace{(1-c)N}_\text{factory production cost} + \underbrace{TF}_\text{transport cost} &lt; \underbrace{1N}_\text{village production cost}$$`
--

Divide each side by `\(N\)`, add `\(c - 1\)`, and you get the conditions under which agglomeration is cheaper:

--

`$$T\left(\frac{F}{N}\right) &lt; c$$`

--

In other words, you should expect countries to urbanize when:

- **Transportation** is cheap `\((T)\)`
- **Agricultural productivity** is high `\((\frac{F}{N}\)` small)
- Cost-savings from **scale economies** are large `\((c)\)`

# Four Waves of Urbanization

## Four Waves of Urbanization

Over the next week, we'll talk about four significant periods of urbanization in human history. 

--

- The United States (19th Century)

--

- The First Cities (~3000 BC)

--

- Pre-Industrial Europe (1500-1800)

--

- China (20th and 21st Centuries)

--

Each one was preceded by new technologies that:

--

- Reduced the cost of **transportation**

--

- Increased **agricultural productivity**

--

- Facilitated **scale economies**

World history class review. *Homo sapiens* appears about 300,000 years ago. These are anatomically, genetically identical to you and I. Dress them up in modern clothes and sit them in one of these seats and no one would know they didn't belong there.

Spreads around the world over the course of the next 200,000 years. We're in the Americas around 15,000 years ago.

But we don't see evidence of "civilization" (derives from Latin; basically means "people who live in cities") until ~3000 BC.

Why did it take so long???

- Transportation (mostly along rivers)
- Agriculture (grain domestication)
- Scale economies (writing)

## The Problem With Large-Scale Societies

--

As the size of a group get bigger, it becomes more difficult to manage relationships and resolve disputes.

--

.pull-left[
**Metcalfe's Law, Redux:**

- In an apartment with 4 roommates, there are 6 possible sources of conflict.

- In a club with 30 members, that number is 435.

- In a sorority with 300 members, there are 45,000 possible conflicts.

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/metcalfe.svg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

???

The more relationships, the more difficult it is to resolve disputes in an informal way. You start to need laws.

---

## The Problem With Large-Scale Societies

--

Traditional societies tend to be organized in small bands of 100-200 individuals .cite[(Dunbar 1998)].

--

&lt;img src="img/dunbar-regression.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

A city like Uruk (est. pop. 40,000) is well beyond what our brains can support.

???

Part of the reason why we have such a large neocortex is to keep track of large numbers of social relationships.

---

## The Problem With Large-Scale Societies

--

**Collective action problems** -- scenarios where there is a conflict between the individual interest and the groups interest -- get harder as groups get larger.

--

To demonstrate, let's play a quick game.

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Common Pool Game Rules:**

--

- You all get an extra 10% on your next quiz. Congratulations!

--

- You can choose to donate all, half, or none of that bonus to a **common pool**.

--

- Once everyone makes their contributions, I will take the common pool, multiply the points by `\(1.5x\)`, and distribute them evenly to everyone.

--

&lt;br&gt;

What happened? What do you think would have happened if this were a class of 300 instead of 45? What if it were a class of 30,000?

--

What are some examples of problems like this in real life?

---

## The Urban Revolution

Without a **state** to organize large-scale collective action, settle disputes, and administer laws, cities with many thousands of people would be impossible.

## Rivers Made Cities

--

It's no coincidence that every early civilization is found at the end of a big river.

![](img/World_in_2000_BC.svg)

--

Rivers provide (1) fertile soil, and (2) frictionless transportation.

---

## Rivers Made Cities

To maintain a city with tens of thousands of people you need:

--

.pull-left[

- Thousands of acres of land under cultivation

- Enormous quantities of wood (both for fires &amp; construction)

- Goods traded from other ecological zones

]

.pull-right[
![](img/scott-fig14.png)

--

This would be logistically impossible without a method for reliably transporting goods over long distances.

???

Rivers provide that method. Chop down a tree, float it downriver. Sadly this leads to deforestation.

see Scott pg. 106

## The Urban Revolution

--

With these prerequisites in place, cities start to pop up across the globe.

--

- But cities make up a small fraction of the population for the next few thousand years. 

  - There were approximately 25 million people on Earth in 3000 BC. Only a few hundred thousand lived in city-states.

--

- History focuses on these places because they're the ones that leave archaeological records, but the *vast* bulk of humanity didn't live in cities.

--

- That started to change only recently.

Between 800 and 1800, we see a series of "urban revolutions" in Europe, starting with Italian city-states, then the Low Countries, and finally Britain.

## Warfare

Here's Europe in the 1300s. With such extreme **political fragmentation**, there's almost always someone at war with someone else.

&lt;img src="img/europe-1300.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Warfare

Remember how military defense exhibits scale economies?

&lt;img src="img/circle.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

If large cities can defend themselves more effectively than smaller towns, perhaps warfare pushed Europe towards urbanization.

---

## Warfare

As best we can tell, yes! If you geolocate all the battles that took place between 800 and 1800 and overlay them on a map of major cities, there's a very strong correlation.

&lt;img src="img/dincecco-onorato.png" width="110%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Warfare

**Caution**: remember that correlation `\(\neq\)` causation!

--

Maybe cities are just more attractive targets for warfare?

--

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt;

It's tough to untangle the causality here, but if you look at growth rates over time, it seems that the battles predict greater rates of urbanization in subsequent centuries.
