Check the Schedule tab for an overview of each week’s topics and assignments. On the navbar, you can also find links to read the syllabus, schedule an office hours appointment, read your classmates’ comments on the readings, and visit the class code repository.\r\nGetting Started\r\nThere is a lot of software to install for this class, but in the instructions below I’ve tried to make it as straightforward as possible. (And everything is free!) Before the end of our first week, please complete the following steps.\r\n\r\nR\r\nYou won’t get super far in an R class without R. The most current version is available here. To download, click link for your operating system (i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux), then follow the instructions on the page.\r\nRStudio\r\nR is the programming language itself, but it comes with a pretty unfriendly interface.\r\n\r\nYou don’t want to do all your typing in that lonely black box. Instead, you want RStudio, a piece of software that makes R much prettier. Download the RStudio Desktop version here.\r\nVersion Control: git\r\nProfessional coders use a version control system called git to keep track of their code. If you’re on a Mac, skip this section. Your machine already has it installed.2 If you use a PC, follow the installation instructions here.\r\nUsing git to track changes in your code involves a bit of struggle on the front end, but it is well worth it (Bryan 2017).3 I’ll walk you through the basics in class.\r\nReference Management: Zotero\r\nThis software makes it blindingly simple to keep track of and format your citations. It also plays really nicely with RStudio. Download it here and follow the setup instructions. The Chrome extension is particularly useful; anything you find on the Internet can be saved to your library with one click.\r\nSocial Annotation: Hypothesis\r\nThis semester, we’ll be using a social annotation platform called Hypothesis. That way, everyone will be able to post comments/questions/concerns/memes directly into the reading assignments. Follow these steps to get started:\r\nClick the book icon in the top-right corner of the course website. This will take you to our Hypothesis Group Page.\r\nIf you don’t already have an account, you will be prompted to create one. Make your username something like firstname_lastname so we know who is posting!\r\nHypothesis works best with Google Chrome. If you don’t have it, install it here.\r\nInstall the Chrome extension. When you do, it should take you to a welcome page with instructions on how to log in, pin the extension, and start annotating pages!\r\n\r\nGo to the syllabus and add your questions/comments/memes. Whenever you annotate a reading, just make sure that you are posting to the Group instead of Public (see the dropdown menu at the top of the extension).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBryan, Jennifer. 2017. “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk about Version Control?” https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3159v2.\r\n\r\n\r\nR is a powerful (and in-demand!) tool for data analysis and communication. For example, this very website was built with R.↩︎\r\nI think? If you’re on a Mac and you can’t get git to work, let me know!↩︎\r\nIt’s something you can put on your resume and people will be super impressed.↩︎\r\n",

Make sure you’ve completed everything from the Getting Started section on the home page.\r\nReading Assignments\r\nBefore next week, please read and annotate the following:\r\nHealy Preface (and complete the package installation instructions at the bottom)\r\nHealy Chapter 2\r\nTeam Project\r\nFind the file R/week-01/team-project-1.Rmd in our GitHub repository. Open it and make the following changes:\r\nEdit the author metadata to list each person on your team.\r\nFollow the instructions in each code chunk.\r\nKnit to HTML.\r\nSubmit the knitted HTML document to eLC1\r\nEveryone on the team needs to submit to eLC in order to receive credit, even if you worked together. (It just makes it easier for me. Thanks!)\r\n\r\n↩︎\r\n",
