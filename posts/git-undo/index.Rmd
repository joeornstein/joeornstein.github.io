When using [GitHub](bryan-2017.pdf) to manage changes to analyses, manuscripts, and slides, my most frequent frustration occurs when I forget to add a large (>50MB) data file to my `.gitignore`. I merrily type --

```
git add .
git commit -m "unsuspecting commit message"
git push
```

-- and GitHub explodes because of a file size limit. 

The maddening bit is that you can't just retroactively tell `git` to ignore the file, because it's already tracked and in your history. So I set out to find a sequence of commands that would effectively (and quickly) undo the addition of the large file.

After much searching, the winning solution comes from [Dalibor Nasevic](https://dalibornasevic.com/posts/2-permanently-remove-files-and-folders-from-a-git-repository), abbreviated below:

```
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf PATH-TO-BIG-FILE' HEAD
git push origin master --force
```

The first line recursively searches through your commits to find and remove the big file. The second line "force pushes" the revision to GitHub.

Of course, erasing your own history is a serious step not to be taken lightly, so make sure you only remove the files you tracked by accident.
