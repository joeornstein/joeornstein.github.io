    "text": "Move some of the class notes to the front here.\n\nReading\n\nR4DS Chapters 3-4\nR4DS Chapter 12\n\n\n\nProblem Set\nThis week, we’re going to be summarizing different variables from the CES 2020 dataset. You’ll need to use the codebook to identify which variables contain the information you want, tidy them up, and then summarize. Write an R script that performs these tasks, compile a PDF report, and submit the report.\nHere are the questions I’d like you to answer:\n\nAre labor union members more likely to be Democrats or Republicans?\nWhat is the median age of people with landline phones, compared to those who only have cell phones?\nAre people who read the newspaper more likely to correctly answer the questions about who controls the US House of Representatives and US Senate?\nWhich religious groups are the most and least likely to support making abortion illegal in all circumstances?\nBonus. The CES oversamples some respondents relative to their frequency among registered voters in order to get a better statistical picture of some smaller subgroups. The dataset contains a weight variable for each respondent, reflecting how much that type of respondent is overrepresented in the sample compared to the population. Compare the mean age of the sample with the weighted mean age of the sample. What do you notice? Do the same thing for the unweighted and weighted shares of each racial group. Redo the analyses in questions 1-4 using weighted means. What conclusions, if any, change?\n\n\n\nClass Notes\nUp to now, we’ve been working with pretty tidy datasets. Every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every value is where it should be. But things are not always this way. More often than you’re going to like, data comes to you an unruly mess, and you’ll need to tidy it up before you can even start to explore it.\nThis week, we’ll learn some of the most important functions in the tidyverse for data wrangling.\n\nIn your last problem set, you worked with a tidied up version of the Cooperative Election Study (CES) from 2020. Let’s look at the steps I took to import and clean up that dataset.\n\nImporting The Data\nThe CES is a survey of a representative sample of 50,000+ American adults, conducted every election year by a large consortium of universities. The data going back to 2006 is available here. Go to that site and download the 2020 dataset, a 180 megabyte monster called CES20_Common_OUTPUT_vv.csv.\nThe .csv extension at the end of the file means that it is a “comma separated value” file. This is a file where all of the values are separated by commas. Looks something like this:\nname, age, party\n'Joe', 35, 'Bull Moose'\n'Fiona', 6, 'Birthday'\n'Avery', 3, 'Know Nothing'\nIt’s a nice standardized way to represent datasets, and fortunately for us, the read_csv() function allows us to read such files into R. Let’s create an object called ces_raw from that raw dataset.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nces_raw &lt;- read_csv('data/raw/CES20_Common_OUTPUT_vv.csv')\n\nThis dataset has a lot of information.\n\ndim(ces_raw)\n\n[1] 61000   717\n\n\n61,000 rows and 717 columns, to be precise. The first few rows and columns look like this:\n\nhead(ces_raw)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 717\n   ...1     caseid commonweight commonpostweight vvweight vvweight_post tookpost\n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1 1232318697        0.783            0.666    0.851         0.607        2\n2     2 1231394915        1.34             1.44    NA            NA            2\n3     3 1232451503        0.406            0.342   NA            NA            2\n4     4 1232494791        0.958            0.822    1.04          1.00         2\n5     5 1232494829        0.195            0.162   NA            NA            2\n6     6 1232473675        1.06             0.880    1.15          0.988        2\n# ℹ 710 more variables: CCEStake &lt;dbl&gt;, birthyr &lt;dbl&gt;, gender &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   educ &lt;dbl&gt;, race &lt;dbl&gt;, race_other &lt;chr&gt;, hispanic &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   CC20_hisp_1 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_4 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   CC20_hisp_5 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_6 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_7 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_8 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   CC20_hisp_9 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_10 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_11 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   CC20_hisp_12 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_hisp_t &lt;chr&gt;, CC20_asian_1 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   CC20_asian_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_asian_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, CC20_asian_4 &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\nRecoding Variables\nNow that we have the dataset loaded into memory, let’s find the variables we’re interested in keeping and clean them up a bit. For example, gender is coded as a 1 or 2.\n\nces_raw |&gt; \n  count(gender)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  gender     n\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1      1 25791\n2      2 35209\n\n\nLet’s make this more readable. The codebook (available at the same site where you downloaded the data) says that 1 is male and 2 is female. We can create a new version of the gender column using the mutate() and if_else() functions.\n\nces_clean &lt;- ces_raw |&gt; \n  mutate(gender = if_else(gender == 1, 'Male', 'Female'))\n\nces_clean |&gt; \n  count(gender)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  gender     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n1 Female 35209\n2 Male   25791\n\n\nWhat about the education variable (educ)?\n\nces_clean |&gt; \n  count(educ)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n   educ     n\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     1  1983\n2     2 16618\n3     3 13330\n4     4  6539\n5     5 14152\n6     6  8378\n\n\nThat’s a lot of categories to clean up. We can combine the mutate() function with case_when() to recode a bunch of different values at the same time.\n\nces_clean &lt;- ces_clean |&gt; \n  mutate(educ = case_when(educ == 1 ~ 'No HS',\n                          educ == 2 ~ 'High school graduate',\n                          educ == 3 ~ 'Some college',\n                          educ == 4 ~ '2-year',\n                          educ == 5 ~ '4-year',\n                          educ == 6 ~ 'Post-grad'))\nces_clean |&gt; \n  count(educ)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  educ                     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n1 2-year                6539\n2 4-year               14152\n3 High school graduate 16618\n4 No HS                 1983\n5 Post-grad             8378\n6 Some college         13330\n\n\nNow the variable has the correct labels, but notice that the order in that table is kind of weird. We tend to think of education as an ordinal variable, because there’s a natural order from least to most educated. But R doesn’t know that yet. It just thinks of educ as a character variable, and lists them in alphabetical order. We can tell R about the variable order by recoding educ as a factor.\n\nces_clean &lt;- ces_clean |&gt; \n  mutate(educ = factor(educ,\n                       levels = c('No HS', \n                                  'High school graduate',\n                                  'Some college',\n                                  '2-year',\n                                  '4-year',\n                                  'Post-grad')))\nces_clean |&gt; \n  count(educ)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  educ                     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n1 No HS                 1983\n2 High school graduate 16618\n3 Some college         13330\n4 2-year                6539\n5 4-year               14152\n6 Post-grad             8378\n\n\nMuch better!\nThere’s a variable in CES called birthyr. What if we wanted to know the respondents age in 2020 instead? The mutate() function can help us here too.\n\nces_clean |&gt; \n  count(birthyr)\n\n# A tibble: 78 × 2\n   birthyr     n\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1    1925     2\n 2    1926     6\n 3    1927    10\n 4    1928    12\n 5    1929    23\n 6    1930    23\n 7    1931    42\n 8    1932    55\n 9    1933    76\n10    1934   109\n# ℹ 68 more rows\n\nces_clean &lt;- ces_clean |&gt; \n  mutate(age = 2020 - birthyr)\n\nces_clean |&gt; \n  count(birthyr, age)\n\n# A tibble: 78 × 3\n   birthyr   age     n\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1    1925    95     2\n 2    1926    94     6\n 3    1927    93    10\n 4    1928    92    12\n 5    1929    91    23\n 6    1930    90    23\n 7    1931    89    42\n 8    1932    88    55\n 9    1933    87    76\n10    1934    86   109\n# ℹ 68 more rows\n\n\n\n\nJoining Datasets\nHere’s another messy feature of this dataset. Every respondent has a variable called inputstate, representing the state where they live.\n\nces_clean |&gt; \n  count(inputstate)\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 2\n   inputstate     n\n        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1          1   947\n 2          2   115\n 3          4  1463\n 4          5   536\n 5          6  5035\n 6          8  1061\n 7          9   642\n 8         10   240\n 9         11   197\n10         12  4615\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n\nBut it’s a number! Not, like, the actual name of the state, which would be more useful to me.

    "text": "The Fundamental Problem of Measurement\nOur theories about the world often involve concepts and ideas that we cannot observe directly with our senses. Political scientists are interested in particularly nebulous concepts—like democracy, polarization, freedom, ideology, representation, warfare, alliances—ideas that are all quite sensible when described in words, but lack an obvious method for categorization and measurement in the real world. In statistical terminology, something like a person’s ideology (Converse 1964) is a latent characteristic, something that we cannot observe directly. Instead, we observe behaviors that we think are influenced by a person’s ideology—which campaign they donate to, how they respond to survey questions, how they vote on bills, etc.—and infer their ideology on the basis of those observed characteristics (Barber 2021). But it’s important to remember these observable measures are always imperfect glimpses at the theoretical concepts we’re trying to understand."

    "section": "The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference",
    "text": "The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference\nScientists are rarely satisfied with measurement alone. We don’t just want to describe the world (“Candidate X won the election”); we want our theories to explain why the world works the way it does (“Candidate X won because she spent more on TV advertising”). Fundamentally, every such causal claim is implicitly a counterfactual claim (“If Candidate X had spent less money on TV advertising, she would have been more likely to lose.”). But the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that we can’t observe counterfactuals. We only know what happened in this universe, and can never know with any certainty what would have happened if circumstances were different. This makes testing causal claims rather difficult, because the best we can do is look at average differences across different data points."

    "section": "The Fundamental Problem of Samples",
    "text": "The Fundamental Problem of Samples\nScientists strive to develop general theories about the world; a theory is more useful if it can be fruitfully applied to a large number of cases and situations. But we rarely if ever observe our entire population of interest, so we can never say with certainty that the patterns we observe in our dataset will hold true for the population at large. This is particularly problematic if our observed sample is selected in a non-random fashion, making it unrepresentative of the larger population.\n\nOne can think of these three fundamental problems as three different kinds of missing data problems—whether it’s a latent characteristic, a counterfactual, or observations not included in your dataset—there is some information that we do not observe directly, and so we have to predict what it might be on the basis of the information we do observe. Fortunately, we have a number of methods for credibly making these sorts of inferences. We’ll learn several of them in the first half of this semester!"

Our goal over the next few weeks is to train you to complete the entire data analysis pipeline: importing raw datasets, tidying them up, joining together information from multiple datasets, making sure everything is formatted correctly, performing statistical analyses, and communicating your results.\nWe’ll start by discussing data visualization, which is an essential tool at every step along that pipeline. Our brains are hardwired to detect patterns in images, and a well-crafted data visualization can take advantage of that fact to communicate lots of information about your data all at once. This makes visualization a particularly effective tool for communicating results to your audience.\nBut don’t think that visualization is just something you do at the end of the project when you’re writing up the paper. Charts are a useful diagnostic tool as well, revealing patterns in data that summary statistics alone might miss, as the Datasaurus Dozen artfully reveals…\n\nThis week, we dive deeper into building visualizations with the ggplot2 package (a part of the tidyverse). It will take some time to learn all of the function syntax, so be patient with yourself. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll have an endlessly flexible tool for exploring and communicating patterns in your data.\n\nReading\n\nR4DS Chapters 1-2\n\n\n\nProblem Set\nIn a knitted R script or Quarto document, complete the following exercises.\n\nRecreate the following chart using the voting.csv dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreate the following chart using the ANES.csv dataset.

Feel free to consult your classmates with questions about the problem sets, but I expect you to submit your answers individually. Resist the temptation to copy-paste your classmates’ code. You are much more likely to learn if you type your responses yourself. Each problem set contains a Bonus problem that will require you to conduct some independent research beyond that week’s reading. Problem sets will be graded pass/fail, where a passing grade indicates that you have correctly solved over 70% of the problems.\nThe semester will culminate with each student completing an independent research project. During the final two weeks, students will present an original analysis of a dataset of their choice. To meet expectations, the project should address in a satisfying way issues relating to measurement, causal inference, and sampling, and students should submit code and a codebook that allows others to replicate their analysis from the raw dataset. Within 48 hours of your presentation, I will provide you a list of revisions that I think would improve the research. Completing these revisions before the end of finals period is a requirement for earning an A- or A in the course. Students wishing to earn an A will—in addition to the presentation, code, and codebook—submit a final paper that includes an abstract, brief literature review, and discussion of their findings.\nThe final letter grade you earn for the semester will be determined based on the number of problem sets you complete that meet expectations, the number of bonus problems you successfully complete, and your performance on the final project. Consult the table below for the minimum requirements for each letter grade. To earn a given letter grade, you must complete the requirements for that grade and all the grades below it, and students must at least meet the requirements for a C to pass the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nProblem Sets\nBonus Problems\nFinal Project\n\n\n\n\nA\n10\n8\nSubmit a final paper\n\n\nA-\n9\n5\nComplete requested revisions\n\n\nB+\n8\n2\nCode successfully replicates\n\n\nB\n7\n0\nProvide code and codebook\n\n\nC\n6\n0\nPresent final project"
