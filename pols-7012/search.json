Feel free to consult your classmates with questions about the problem sets, but I expect you to submit your answers individually. Resist the temptation to copy-paste your classmates’ code. You are much more likely to learn if you type your responses yourself. Each problem set contains a Bonus problem that will require you to conduct some independent research beyond that week’s reading. Problem sets will be graded pass/fail, where a passing grade indicates that you have correctly solved over 70% of the problems.\nThe semester will culminate with each student completing an independent research project. During the final two weeks, students will present an original analysis of a dataset of their choice. To meet expectations, the project should address in a satisfying way issues relating to measurement, causal inference, and sampling, and students should submit code and a codebook that allows others to replicate their analysis from the raw dataset. Within 48 hours of your presentation, I will provide you a list of revisions that I think would improve the research. Completing these revisions before the end of finals period is a requirement for earning an A- or A in the course. Students wishing to earn an A will—in addition to the presentation, code, and codebook—submit a final paper that includes an abstract, brief literature review, and discussion of their findings.\nThe final letter grade you earn for the semester will be determined based on the number of problem sets you complete that meet expectations, the number of bonus problems you successfully complete, and your performance on the final project. Consult the table below for the minimum requirements for each letter grade. To earn a given letter grade, you must complete the requirements for that grade and all the grades below it, and students must at least meet the requirements for a C to pass the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nProblem Sets\nBonus Problems\nFinal Project\n\n\n\n\nA\n10\n8\nSubmit a final paper\n\n\nA-\n9\n5\nComplete requested revisions\n\n\nB+\n8\n2\nCode successfully replicates\n\n\nB\n7\n0\nProvide code and codebook\n\n\nC\n6\n0\nPresent final project"

(2007) find an interesting paradox in which rich people are more likely to vote for Republican presidential candidates, but rich US states are more likely to vote for Democrats. In this problem set, we will see if this paradox still holds true in the year 2020.\n\nLoad the raw CES 2020 dataset and tidy the family income, 2020 presidential vote choice, and state of residence variables as necessary.\nWere rich people more likely to vote Republican in 2020? Compute the percent of respondents at each family income level that reported voting for Joe Biden, and plot the relationship.\nUse the tidycensus package to get a dataset with 5-year estimates of median income from the 2020 American Community Survey.\nJoin the individual-level survey data with the median income variable by state.\nWere rich states more likely to vote Democratic in 2020? Create a state-level dataset with each state’s median income and the percent of CES respondents in that state that reported voting for Joe Biden. Plot the relationship and fit a linear model, reporting the estimated slope.\nBonus. Another finding from the Gelman et al. (2007) paper is that the relationship between individual-level income and vote choice is strongest in poor states and weakest in rich states. Let’s see if that result still holds up in 2020. Create a variable that splits the dataset into three groups: poor states (poorest third of the US states), middle-income states (middle third), and rich states (richest third of the US states). Then repeat the individual-level analysis in problem 2, faceting by this new income-group variable.\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFor a primer on fuzzy record linkage (merging datasets when the key variables do not contain exact matches), might I suggest this paper and R package?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGelman, Andrew, Boris Shor, Joseph Bafumi, and David Park. 2007. “Rich State, Poor State, Red State, Blue State: What’s the Matter with Connecticut?” Quarterly Journal of Political Science 2 (June 2006): 345–67. https://doi.org/10.1561/100.00006026."

Note that the data itself doesn’t start until row 5, so you’ll need to account for that (hint: check out the skip argument in read.csv()).\nPivot the dataset so that each row is a country-year (e.g. Peru 1970), and there is a single column with the GDP per capita variable.\nMake sure that the resulting year variable is formatted correctly as a numeric.

Some economic growth theories suggest that poor countries should grow faster on average than rich countries (convergence). Other theories suggest that rich countries will grow faster than poor countries (divergence). Which theory appears to be a better description of the period between 1990 and 2015? Compute the annualized growth rate for each country during that period, and estimate the relationship between GDP per capita in 1990 and growth over the following 25 years.

Our brains are hardwired to detect patterns in images, and a well-crafted data visualization can take advantage of that fact to communicate lots of information about your data all at once. This makes visualization a particularly effective tool for communicating results to your audience.\nBut don’t think that visualization is just something you do at the end of the project when you’re writing up the paper. Charts are a useful diagnostic tool as well, revealing patterns in data that summary statistics alone might miss, as the Datasaurus Dozen artfully reveals…\n\nThis week, we dive deeper into building visualizations with the ggplot2 package (a part of the tidyverse).

    "text": "The Central Limit Theorem\nNext, notice the shape of the sampling distribution in the figure above. It’s this nice bell curve that’s well-approximated by the “normal” distribution . Why is the sampling distribution normally shaped, even though the thing we’re sampling from is not normal distributed? Well that’s one of the most fascinating and magical theorems in all of statistics: the Central Limit Theorem. The sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normally distributed—as long as you have a sufficiently large sample size.\nIntuition: some samples will, by chance, contain an unrepresentatively large number of females. Some will contain an unrepresentatively small number females. But most of the time, the females and non-females will cancel each other out, such that the mass of the distribution is centered around the truth.\nThere are a bunch of nice simulations that showing the Central Limit Theorem in action. In class, you’ll get to play around with one.\nNormal distributions are nice. They allow us to say precisely how far a sample estimate is likely to deviate from the truth. For example, we know that about 68% of a normal distribution falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n\nexpected_value &lt;- mean(sampling_distribution)\nstandard_error &lt;- sd(sampling_distribution)\nnum_draws &lt;- length(sampling_distribution)\n\nwithin_1sd &lt;- sum(sampling_distribution &gt; expected_value - standard_error &\n      sampling_distribution &lt; expected_value + standard_error)\n\nwithin_1sd / num_draws\n\n[1] 0.6835\n\n\nAnd about 95% of observations will fall within two standard deviations.\n\nwithin_2sd &lt;- sum(sampling_distribution &gt; expected_value - 2*standard_error &\n                        sampling_distribution &lt; expected_value + 2*standard_error)\n\nwithin_2sd / num_draws\n\n[1] 0.9559\n\n\nAnd about 99.7% will fall within 3 standard deviations.

Political scientists are interested in particularly nebulous concepts—like democracy, polarization, freedom, ideology, representation, warfare, alliances—ideas that are all quite sensible when described in words, but lack an obvious method for categorization and measurement in the real world. In statistical terminology, something like a person’s ideology (Converse 1964) is a latent characteristic, something that we cannot observe directly. Instead, we observe behaviors that we think are influenced by a person’s ideology—which campaign they donate to, how they respond to survey questions, how they vote on bills, etc.—and infer their ideology on the basis of those observed characteristics (Barber 2021). But it’s important to remember these observable measures are always imperfect glimpses at the theoretical concepts we’re trying to understand."

We don’t just want to describe the world (“Candidate X won the election”); we want our theories to explain why the world works the way it does (“Candidate X won because she spent more on TV advertising”). Fundamentally, every such causal claim is implicitly a counterfactual claim (“If Candidate X had spent less money on TV advertising, she would have been more likely to lose.”). But the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that we can’t observe counterfactuals. We only know what happened in this universe, and can never know with any certainty what would have happened if circumstances were different. This makes testing causal claims rather difficult, because the best we can do is look at average differences across different data points."

But we rarely if ever observe our entire population of interest, so we can never say with certainty that the patterns we observe in our dataset will hold true for the population at large. This is particularly problematic if our observed sample is selected in a non-random fashion, making it unrepresentative of the larger population.\n\nOne can think of these three fundamental problems as three different kinds of missing data problems—whether it’s a latent characteristic, a counterfactual, or observations not included in your dataset—there is some information that we do not observe directly, and so we have to predict what it might be on the basis of the information we do observe. Fortunately, we have a number of methods for credibly making these sorts of inferences. We’ll learn several of them in the first half of this semester!"

Each observation is represented by a pair of values \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to find the values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that minimize the sum of squared errors, as given by the following function:\n\\[\nf(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i)^2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\alpha\\)\nLet’s start by minimizing the function with respect to the x-intercept, \\(\\alpha\\). By the sum and chain rules, we get the following partial derivative\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\sum_{i=1}^n -2(y_i-\\alpha-\\beta x_i)\n\\]\nNow we set that equal to zero and solve for \\(\\alpha\\).\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n -2(y_i-\\alpha-\\beta x_i) = 0\n\\]\nDivide each side by -2.\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\alpha-\\beta x_i) = 0\n\\] Split up the sum into its component parts (this is the commutative property; doesn’t matter what order you add things).\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha -  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\beta x_i = 0\n\\]\nWhen you add \\(\\alpha\\) to itself \\(n\\) times you get \\(\\alpha n\\), and we can factor a constant out of the last term on the left.1\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\alpha n -  \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n  x_i = 0\n\\]\nNow here’s the key move of the proof: let’s divide each side by \\(n\\), recalling that sample means are defined as \\(\\frac{\\sum y_i}{n} = \\bar{y}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sum x_i}{n} = \\bar{x}\\).\n\\[\n\\bar{y} - \\alpha -  \\beta \\bar{x} = 0\n\\] Add \\(\\alpha\\) to each side.\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\bar{y} - \\beta \\bar{x}\n\\]\nIn other words, the value of \\(\\alpha\\) that will minimize the sum of squared errors is to take the average value of \\(y\\) and subtract the average value of \\(x\\) times the slope. This makes sense geometrically. Here’s that earlier graph with the line of best fit and dotted lines denoting \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line of best fit will cross through the point where \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\) meet, so naturally the point where it crosses the y-axis will be \\(\\bar{y}\\) minus how much the line increases or decreases between 0 and \\(\\bar{x}\\). Now we just have to figure out the slope, \\(\\beta\\).\n\n\nSolving for \\(\\beta\\)\nLet’s start by taking the SSE function and substituting in the value of \\(\\alpha\\) we just derived.\n\\[\nf(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\\bar{y} - \\beta\\bar{x}) - \\beta x_i)^2\n\\]\nRearrange some terms inside those parentheses.\n\\[\nf(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n ( (y_i - \\bar{y}) - \\beta (x_i - \\bar{x}))^2\n\\]\nLet’s use the same combination of sum rule and chain rule to find the derivative of this SSE function with respect to \\(\\beta\\).\n\\[\n\\frac{df}{d\\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^n -2(x_i - \\bar{x})((y_i-\\bar{y}) - \\beta(x_i-\\bar{x}))\n\\]\nAgain, set that equal to zero and divide by -2.\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})((y_i-\\bar{y}) - \\beta(x_i-\\bar{x})) = 0\n\\]\nSplit up the sum into its component parts and factor out \\(\\beta\\).\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y}) - \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x})^2 = 0\n\\] Solve for \\(\\beta\\).\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\] Recall the definitions of variance (average squared distance from the mean) and covariance (average product of distance from the mean for two variables).\n\\[\nVar(X) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n}\n\\] and\n\\[\nCov(X,Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{n}\n\\] Substituting those two definitions yields the final result:\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)}\n\\]"

Include dashed vertical lines indicating the dates of major campaign events.\nBonus. Compute 95% confidence intervals for each poll assuming random sampling from the population of likely voters. What fraction of these 95% confidence intervals contain the true Democratic vote share in the two states you selected? Does this fraction increase for polls conducted closer to the election? What about polls conducted by pollsters with high “grades” from 538? What about polls conducted over telephone vs. online polls?"
